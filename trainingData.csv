Chang_HZO_FEFET_TED_2017.docx,abstract,"— in this brief, we reported a ferroelectric versatile memory with strained-gate engineering. the versatile memory with high-strain-gate showed a >40% improvement on ferroelectric hysteresis window, compared to low-strain case. the high compressive stress induced from high nitrogen-content tan enhances monoclinic-to-orthorhombic phase transition to reach stronger ferrolectric polarization and lower depolarization field. the versatile memory featuring ferroelectric negative capacitance exhibited excellent transfer characteristics of the sub-60-mvdec subthreshold swing, ultralow off-state leakage of <1fa/µm and >108 on/off current ratio. furthermore, the ferroelectric versatile memory can be switched by ±5 v under 20-ns speed for a long endurance cycling (∼1012cycles). the low-power operation can be ascribed to the amplification of the surface potential to reach the strong inversion and fast domain polarization at the correspondingly low program/erase voltages.index terms— charge trpapping, ferroelectric, multilevel, nonvolatile memory.i.",305

Chang_HZO_FEFET_TED_2017.docx,experiment,"sin this brief, the ferroelectric versatile memory was implemented by using a p-channel mosfet with a combined storage scheme employing ferroelectric hfzro (hzo) and charge-trapped zrsio (zso) layers. then, fabrication proce-dure of p-channel ferroelectric mosfet was described below. first, a 3.5-nm sio2 was grown by vertical furnace as a buffer oxide on n-type silicon substrate. then, the 23-nm-thick hzo ferroelectric layer and 5-nm-thick zso trapping layer were deposited by evaporation and sputter systems. the stacked dielectric was then annealed at 400 °c. subsequently, the 3-nm sio2 was deposited as a top tunnel oxide to form final gate-stack structure. the tan metals with various nitrogen contents were then patterned as gate electrodes. the source and drain regions are followed by a self-aligned bf2+implantation and activated by an rta. finally, al metals were evaporated as source/drain contacts. the fabricated ferroelectric versatile memory has a gate length and width of 10 and 100 μm, respectively. to make a performance comparison, the control ferroelectric memories using a single-layer ferroelectric hfzro with the same dielectric thickness, thermal annealing, and gate-strain process were simultaneously fabricated.iii.",306

Chang_HZO_FEFET_TED_2017.docx,results,"reveal that the subthreshold characteristics of versatile memory are less influenced by gate-stack traps. thus, the gate dielectric stack dominated by ferroelectric negative capacitance is more favorable for enhancing the stability of ferroelectric switching.the high-speed endurance test was also tested for ferroelec-tric versatile memories with low- and high-nitrogen-content tan gates. a read scheme using ion/ioff ratio is adopted to define sense margin and monitor on/off switching states. as shown in fig. 4(a), the “0” state and “1” state can be identified by off-state and on-state currents of transistor transfer char-acteristic. in fig. 4(b), the fast drain-current response reveals that the speed of ferroelectric–antiferroelectric transition can be reached at 20 ns for both program and erase operation. the fast ferroelectric domain switching like static random access memory and dram can be used for cache and main memory.for one-transistor memory device, the read and write scheme has been proposed [19]. the sense margin is defined by ioff/ion ratio under program and erase states. fig. 4(c) depicts the ioff/ion and ss dependence of endurance char-acteristics under the program/erase voltages of ±5 v. for high-strain-gate with 10% n2, the much lower ioff/ion ratiofig. 4.
