20200211_[Clean Copy][Double Column]_FTJ.docx,Abstract,"— Ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) based on doped/alloyed HfO2 and ZrO2 is emerging as a promising candidate for the crossbar array for high density memory and compute-in-memory. FTJ is able to operate under non-destructive read mechanism as opposed to the ferroelectric capacitor. However, due to the low on/off ratio and small read-out current of the tunneling mechanism, the integration HZO-based FTJs with CMOS peripheral sensing circuitry is challenging. Herein, we report an optimized fabrication process that boosts the on-state current while suppressing the off-state current leading to an improved performance in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) based FTJs. The plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposited (PEALD) of HZO and the incorporation of an interlayer Al2O3 are keys to improve the HZO-based FTJ in terms of the on/off ratio and cycling endurance.Index Terms—Ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ), plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD), remnant polarization (Pr), thermal atomic layer deposition (THALD)",251
20200211_[Clean Copy][Double Column]_FTJ.docx,INTRODUCTION,"The ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) is an emerging device that has recently obtained considerable attention in wide-range applications from high density memory to compute-in-memory device [1]–[11]. Compared to other intensively studied three-terminal devices such as ferroelectric field-effect-transistor (Fe-FET) [12]–[14] or ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM) [15], [16], FTJ is a two-terminal device that is suitable for crossbar array. Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in doped/alloyed HfO2 and ZrO2 thin films with post-deposition annealing for crystallization, researchers have investigated process optimizations of the material composition and annealing temperature to improve the quality of HZO based ferroelectrics [17]–[19]. It is noteworthy that HfO2 and ZrO2, the composing elements of the HZO film, have been the most favorably utilized materials in semiconductor industry thanks to their superior compatibility with the silicon fabrication processes. Though HZO-based FeFET and FeRAM are more mature technologies today, HZO-based FTJ has been drawing great attention recently due to its interesting features such as non-destructive read mechanism along and low power operation. There have been two different structural flavors to the FTJ stack, one with interlayer (IL) [3], [9], [11] and the other without IL [1], [2], [4]–[8], [10] adjacent to the ferroelectric layer. The former one has several merits over the latter in that: (i) it has intrinsic diode characteristics, which allows the FTJ to be able to be integrated into crossbar array without additional selector device [3], (ii) it can solve the problem of symmetry of the FTJ layers that leads to reduced tunneling coefficient [11], and (iii) higher remnant polarization (Pr) can be obtained by stacking thicker ferroelectric film [20]. However, the remaining challenges for HZO-based FTJ include low on/off ratio and small read-out current. In this work, Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) based FTJs with two different fabrication techniques (thermal atomic layer deposition, THALD and plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition, PEALD) are systematically compared. It was found that the on/off ratio and cycling endurance characteristics showed much improved performance using PEALD for the layers of IL and HZO. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that an FTJ device fabricated with PEALD is demonstrated with its improved performance compared to prior works using THALD. It is also noteworthy that the entire stack of the FTJ including the electrode was deposited in-situ without breaking the vacuum.",609
20200211_[Clean Copy][Double Column]_FTJ.docx,Discussion,"Fig. 1(a) shows the basic FTJ structure composed of separate layers of TiN, Al2O3, and HZO for top/bottom electrode, IL, and ferroelectric barrier respectively. The TiN layer was deposited with PEALD with thickness of 20 nm while Al2O3 and HZO were deposited either with THALD or PEALD. The precursors of TMA was used for Al2O3 with 2 nm and TDMA-Hf and TDMA-Zr were used for HZO with 10 nm. This entire stack was deposited without breaking the vacuum in the Fiji G2 system at 250 oC. Afterwards, the stack was annealed at 450 oC for 30 s and then the top metal pad of Al layer was deposited with e-beam evaporator with 100 nm. Finally, the top metal pad and electrode were patterned and wet-etched. The fabrication process flow is shown in Fig. 1(b). Fig. 1(c) and (d) Fig. 1.

The thin and thick arrows in the figures represent the small and large tunneling current flowing through the effective energy barriers. In this work, two types of FTJ devices were fabricated, one with Al2O3 and HZO layers by THALD and another one using PEALD. For polarization response test, the aixACCT TF-3000 ferroelectric parameter analyzer was used while dynamic leakage current compensation mode was off. Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the typical polarization-voltage (P-V) characteristics of the entire FTJ stack (after a wake-up process of high electric field of ±7.0 MV/cm) with sweeping voltage from ±3.5 V to ±7.0 V with 0.5 V increment. The remnant polarization (Pr) and saturation polarization (Ps) are rather comparable between the two FTJs. The leakage is, however, severely noticeable for the THALD FTJ in the P-V loop when compared to the PEALD FTJ as voltage increases. This can be correlated with the electrical breakdown properties of the THALD and PEALD HZO-only thin films sandwiched between top and bottom electrodes of TiN, as in Fig. 3(a). The breakdown electric-field (EBD) is larger and also the off-state leakage is lower for the PEALD HZO when compared to THALD HZO. The plasma O2 gas used in PEALD is able to form a clearer crystalline structure with metastable ferroelectric phases, which is considered to be the reason of stronger dielectric property for PEALD HZO than that for THALD HZO [21]. Fig. 3(b) displays the P-V endurance characteristics of the THALD and PEALD HZO capacitor with electric field stress (Epulse) of ±2.5 MV/cm and using triangular pulse with pulse width (tpulse) of 1 ms. It can be observed that the cycling wake-up process is more Fig. 2. P-V characteristics of (a) THALD FTJ and (b) PEALD FTJ.Fig. 2. P-V characteristics of (a) THALD FTJ and (b) PEALD FTJ.Fig. 3.

Moreover, the THALD HZO shows severe fatigue effect right after it experiences the wake-up cycles of 1000. These polarization characteristics demonstrated in Fig. 2 and 3 can be directly related to the FTJ performance as discussed in [13]. For erase (to off-state) and program sequence (to on-state) of the FTJ devices, 6 V and -4 V, with pulse widths of 50 μs and 10 μs respectively, have been applied to the top Al pad using Keithley 4200-SCS. It was found that further increase of program voltage does not increase the on/off ratio but only reduces the endurance cycles. Larger positive voltage and time were needed for erasing because the current is much lower when attempting to turn the device off from the on-state, which can be understood due to the asymmetry in the stack as shown in Fig. 4. (a) On/off ratio, (b) on-current and (c) off-current of the THALD and PEALD FTJs with two representative cells.Fig. 4. (a) On/off ratio, (b) on-current and (c) off-current of the THALD and PEALD FTJs with two representative cells.Fig. 5. Current characteristics of (a) THALD FTJ and (b) PEALD FTJ with cycling endurance.Fig. 5. Current characteristics of (a) THALD FTJ and (b) PEALD FTJ with cycling endurance.Fig. 1(c) and (d). The read voltage of the FTJs was chosen to be 1.5 V which does not generate significant trap sites, and also resulted in the reasonable on/off ratio. In Fig. 4(a), the on/off characteristics of the THALD and PEALD FTJs are shown. The on/off ratio is higher for PEALD FTJ through the endurance cycling. In Fig. 4(b), the ION increases significantly after experiencing approximately 100s of cycles in THALD FTJ from the beginning, which is correspondent to wake-up characteristics of the P-V endurance curve in Fig. 3(b). Considering the relatively small read voltage we used, the on-current (ION) of approximately 10 μA/cm2 for PEALD FTJ is comparable or even higher than previous literature data [4], [11], [22]. In Fig. 4(c), the off-current (IOFF) behavior is shown and it is larger for THALD FTJ owing to its less strong dielectric property as demonstrated in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 3(a). Thus, THALD FTJ",1476

Note that on/off ratio of the PEALD FTJ in this work reaches over 120%, which is the highest value obtained when compared with the HZO-based FTJs except [5] where epitaxial growth technique was utilized. All of these FTJ performance can be understood via the current characteristics of the FTJ in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5(a) and (b), from 10 to 100 cycles indicated as A, A’, B and B’, the wake-up effect can be observed for both FTJs at the negative and positive voltages. The peak current value is both larger in PEALD FTJ, which can explain the higher on/off ratio in Fig. 4(a). Indicated with C, from 100 to 2000 cycles, the fatigue effect in THALD FTJ attributes to the lower ION as well in Fig. 5(a). The exponentially increasing IOFF, as the number of cycles increases for THALD FTJ, can be understood with arrow of D. Finally, it is concluded that both the ION and IOFF could be improved using PEALD process for FTJ, which are correspondent to their ferroelectric properties, i.e., P-V and I-V characteristics.",270
20200211_[Clean Copy][Double Column]_FTJ.docx,Conclusion,"This work demonstrated two types of FTJ devices, where THALD and PEALD have been used in the fabrication process. The FTJ performance in terms of on/off ratio has been compared between the two FTJs with respect to the cycling endurance. It was found that the FTJ with PEALD exhibits boosted on/off ratio along with better cycling endurance. Most importantly, device performance of the FTJs was explained corresponding to not only P-V but also the I-V characteristics. For the suppressed IOFF, it could be explained with the stronger dielectric property of the more crystallized PEALD HZO layer having lower leakage and higher EBD. The higher ION from the PEALD FTJ is attributed to the relatively higher Pr value and its non-fatiguing behavior. Since it is the first time to demonstrate the enhanced performance of PEALD HZO-stacked FTJs, this work will shed light on improvement of FTJ devices in the future research.",200

Metal–ferroelectric–metal (MFM) stacks with a doped HfO2 thick-ness of 10 nm (unless different thicknesses are mentioned) were annealed in a rapid thermal anneal chamber in N2 at 650–1000 °C to crystallize the whole material stack.

The Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films consist of tetragonal, orthorhombic, and monoclinic phases. The orthorhombic phase content, which is responsible for the ferroelectricity in this material, is almost independent of Tanneal, but decreases with increasing tf. In contrast, increasing Tanneal and tf monotonically increases (decreases) the amount of monoclinic (tetragonal) phase, which coincides with the variations in the dielectric constant. The remanant polarization was determined by the content of orthorhombic phase as well as the spatial distribution of other phases. V C 2013 AIP Publishing LLC. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4811483]Recently, it was reported that HfO2 thin films can be fer-roelectric when they are doped with various elements, such as Si, Y, Al, and Zr.1–5Recently, the authors reported that Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) film grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique has a strong resistance to the degradation by hydrogen annealing,5which is a great merit of this material for its application to ferroelectric random access memory. The ferroelectricity of HfO2-based films is believed to result from the formation of non-centrosymmetric Pbc21 orthorhom-bic phase (o-phase).1–5However, the formation of the o-phase in thin HZO film is not trivial, since it is stable only under cer-tain high-pressure (or anisotropic-strain) circumstances,6–9 while the metastability of tetragonal phase (P42/nmc, t-phase) over the stable monoclinic phase (P21/c, m-phase) is well known from surface energy arguments.10–15Lowther et al. reported that the application of a hydrostatic pressure of 3–4 GPa to m-phase HfO2 can induce the transition to o-phase using theoretical modelling work.6However, thin film sys-tems can hardly experience hydrostatic pressure due to its two-dimensional nature, and thus, the possible transition of the HZO film to the o-phase by the hydrostatic pressure effect can be neglected. In contrast, HZO films can be subjected to afrom the structures of the t- and o-phases. Table I summarizes the 2c/(aþb) ratio of t- and o-phases of HfO2, ZrO2, and HZO. The o-phase has a ratio of 1.038–1.042, depending on the composition, while those of the t-phase of HfO2 and ZrO2 are only 1.028 and 1.015, respectively. Therefore, the aniso-tropic stress facilitates the t- to o-phase transition.The direct transition between m- and o-phases is usually hindered due to the largely different crystalline structures of the two phases,22which may explain the absence of o-phase in pure HfO2 and ZrO2.4Also, pure polycrystalline HfO2 films have hardly any t-phase, since the grain size is usually over the critical size for the transition to the t-phase (�7-10 nm),13so these films almost always have m-phase. In con-trast, polycrystalline ZrO2 easily shows t-phase, especially on TiN, since its grain size is usually smaller than the critical value (� 30 nm).10–12However, the 2 c/(aþb) ratio of t-phase ZrO2 is too small compared with that of o-phase to induce the transition to o-phase (Table I). Therefore, HZO might have an appropriate grain size to induce the t-phase, which could be transformed to the o-phase as the stress evolves with the film growth or heat-treatment, and could also have a 2 c/(aþb) ra-tio close enough to that of the o-phase to induce the phasetwo-dimensional compressive or tensile stress, depending on transition.the process conditions and substrates, due to local lattice and thermal expansion mismatches with the substrate. Amorphous or polycrystalline HfO2 and ZrO2 films grown by ALD on Si substrates are usually under tensile stress, due to thermal expansion mismatch.16,17Meanwhile, Kisi reported on the transition of t-phase ZrO2 grains with lenticular shape embed-ded in bulk cubic-phase ZrO2, which was stabilized by MgO doping. The transition from the t-phase to o-phase was facili-tated by compressive stress along the a-b plane and tensile stress along the c-axis direction.7The necessary stress was only �760 MPa tensile and �50 MPa compressive,7which can be readily achieved in HZO thin films.

For electrical characterization, the polarization-voltage (P-V), capacitance-voltage (C-V), and current-voltage characteris-tics (I-V) were measured at room temperature using a ferro-electric tester (TF analyzer 2000, Aixacct systems), an impedance analyzer (4194A, HP), and a semiconductor pa-rameter analyzer (4145B, HP), respectively.Figures 1(a)–1(c) show the detailed GAXRD spectra in the 2h range of 27�-33�for 10-, 17-, and 25-nm-thick HZOfilms, respectively.23Unambiguous identification of the m-, o-, and t-phases in an HfO2-ZrO2 system using a laboratory X-ray system is quite challenging due to the proximity of the diffraction peaks from the different phases. The discrimina-tion of o- and t-phases is especially challenging due to their structural similarity. Nevertheless, the diffraction peaks near a 2h of 30.5�are very useful to discern these two phases. Peaks ascribed to the m-phase can be identified quite easily, since there are characteristic peaks near 2h values of 28.5�and 31.6�. For the case of 5.5-nm-thick films, the GAXRD spectra were smeared due to their small tf. The peaks at�28.5�, �30.5�, and �31.6�could be assigned as m(�111), o(111)/t(011), and m(111), respectively. The intensity near 30.5�originates from the overlapped o(111) and t(011) peaks. B€oscke et al. reported that 2h value of t(011) peak is slightly larger than that of o(111) peak for the case of Si-doped HfO2 films.22The GAXRD peaks of the 27.5�–33�region were, therefore, simulated using Gaussian functions with fixed peak locations at 28.54�, 30.40�, 30.80�, and 31.64�for m(-111), o(111), t(011), and m(111), respectively. The assignment of o(111) peak location to 30.40�was based on the lattice parameters of HZO film suggested by Mueller et al.4However, (011) peak position of t-phase HZO cannot be found from literature. The only data that could be found were on the (011) positions for t-phase HfO2 (Ref. 14) and t-phase ZrO2 (Ref. 20).

For the case of 17-and 25-nm-thick films, the as-deposited films show a strong peak at 30.5�and weak peaks at 28.5�and 31.6�, suggesting that the films were already crystallized with a mixture of m-and o/t-phases. Increasing Tanneal decreases the intensity of the peak at 30.5�, while the intensities of the peaks at 28.5�and 31.6�increase, which suggests that the annealing at higher temperature increases and decreases the portion ofm-, and o/t phases, respectively. In addition, the position of the peak near 30.5�shifted toward the low 2h region with increasing Tanneal for 10- and 17-nm-thick films. However, such a shift was not observed for the peaks near 28.5�and 31.6�. Figure 1(d) shows the variations in the location of the maximum point of the peak near 30.5�as a function of Tanneal. Interestingly, the peak near 30.5�of the 25-nm-thick sample did not show such a change, as shown in Fig. 1(d).The diffraction peaks near a 2h of 30.5�were deconvo-luted assuming that the peaks are composed of twocomponents with peak locations at 30.4�(o-phase) and 30.8�(t-phase), with Gaussian shapes. In addition, the peaks located at 28.54�and 31.64�, both corresponding to the m-phase, are also simulated using the same Gaussian functions to compare the relative area ratio of the peaks. The variations in the relative ratio of the integrated area of the peaks of each phase to the sum of them are shown in the lower panels of Figs. 2(b)–2(d) for the 10-, 17-, and 25-nm-thick films, as a function of Tanneal.23Post-deposition annealing can influ-ence the film structure by densification and crystallization. However, as can be understood from Fig. 1, the peak posi-tions corresponding to m-phase hardly show any change by the annealing, whereas the peaks near 2h of 30.5�show sub-stantial change depending on the thickness and annealing temperature. This suggests that the post-annealing and thickness-induced crystallization mainly influence the phase composition not the stress or densification.Several trends in the phase evolution with the tf and Tanneal can be found in these figures. First, the portion of the o-phase is the highest in the thinner 10-nm-thick film. Second, the m-phase certainly increases with the increasing tf and Tanneal. Third, the variation in the o-phase with the Tanneal is relatively small compared with that in other phases, which is the most obvious for the 10-nm-thick film. The followings are suggested for such trends. The film starts to grow with the amorphous (or even nano-crystalline) structure, and becomes crystallized as its tf increases (�10–15 nm) with the accom-panying increase in grain size.23Figures 1(a) and 2(b) clearly reveal that the first crystallization mostly starts with theFIG. 2.

Lett. 102, 242905 (2013)formation of the t-phase, some of which then transform into the o-phase, possibly due to the two-dimensional stress effect. As the Tanneal or tf increases, the grain size increases and the portion of m-phase increases. Figure 2(a) reveals that the t- to m-phase transition is mostly responsible for such transition for the 10-nm-thick film. In contrast, the thicker films appear to involve a more complicated o-phase ! t-phase ! m-phase transition in addition to the t-phase ! m-phase transi-tion. The reason for such variation with tf is not clearly under-stood yet, but it may have some correlation with the change in the stress state. The almost parallel lines for the t- and o-phases in Fig. 2(d) explain the invariant peak position of the 25-nm-thick sample in Fig. 1(d).Now, the electrical properties of the films, double the remanant polarization (2Pr) and the dielectric constant (er, measured at 10 kHz), are compared with the GAXRD data. The P-V curves of each sample are included in Fig. 3.23For the P-V measurement, electric field cycling was performed before the measurement to make the samples free from the wake-up effect in HfO2-based ferroelectrics.23,24The number of cycles needed for the stabilization of P-V hysteresis decreases with increasing Tanneal, and the films annealed at�600�C were free from the wake-up effect. The upper panels of Figs. 2(a)–2(d) show the variation in 2Pr and er of the 5.5-, 10-, 17-, and 25-nm-thick films as a function of Tanneal. The variation in er can be understood more easily from the changes in the crystallographic structures than that in 2Pr. Up to a Tanneal of 500�C, it generally increases due to the overallimprovement in the crystallization. In the Tanneal region of >500�C, it generally decreases with increasing Tanneal, which can be attributed to the increased portion of m-phase, ofwhich the dielectric constant is 17–20, and the decrease ofthe t-phase, of which the dielectric constant is 35–40. Thesmall variation in the o-phase may not have a strong impacton such variations, although it has an intermediate er value (�30).4The er of the as-deposited 5.5- and 10-nm-thick films is only �17. The highest er values of the 5.5-nm-thick film af-ter the annealing at Tanneal > 400�C suggest that the film is mostly crystallized into the t-phase, but the still rather high 2Pr value (�27 lC/cm2) suggests that the o-phase formation is not negligible even in this case. The slight increase in 2Pr and decrease in er with increasing Tanneal suggest that the thin-nest film develops more o-phase as the Tanneal increases. This is a rather different situation from the other thicker films.The 2Pr value of the thicker films generally shows more complicated variations with Tanneal. First, the thicker films generally have lower 2Pr values, suggesting a higher portion of non-ferroelectric t- and m-phases. Yurchuk et al. alsoreported that thick Si:HfO2 film is already crystalized during deposition, which increased the amount of m-phase and accordingly reduced Pr of the layer.25This is a critically dif-ferent aspect of this specific ferroelectric film compared withPb(Zr,Ti)O3 and BaTiO3, which suggests that the HZO films are mixtures of ferroelectric and non-ferroelectric phases.The Pr of a ferroelectric material can be approximately esti-mated using the ionic displacements in a unit cell.26BasedFIG. 3.

Park_CSHWang_FE_AFE_phase_APL_2013.docx,results,"suggest the following.. The non-linear correlation between the 2Pr and relative ratio of o-phase peak intensity reveals that the ferroelectric and non-ferroelectric phases are present with a complicated distribution along the film thickness direction and parallel direction to the film plane.. If they were clearly distinguished from each other and were present in parallel along the film plane, the 2Pr would have to be proportional to the o-phase intensity, which is certainly not the case.. It can be inferred from the generally increasing m-phase por-tion with the increasing tf for almost all Tanneal values that the m-phase grows on top of the t- and o-phases, which must be a reasonable consequence of increasing grain size with increasing tf and lower volumetric free energy of m-phase compared with other phases.. The highest 2Pr of the 10-nm-thick film can be understood from the lower amount of non-ferroelectric m-phase over the o-phase grains.. Meanwhile, the 5.5-nm-thick film may suffer from the deleterious interfa-cial effects with the TiN electrode, such as the dead-layer effect,28which eventually decreases 2Pr compared with 10-nm-thick film.. With a non-ferroelectric phase on top of the ferroelectric phase, the effective electric field applied to the ferroelectric phase is decreased, which is further aggravated as the er of the non-ferroelectric phase decreases.. This can explain the generally decreasing 2Pr with the increasing Tanneal when it is >600�C for the 10- and 17-nm thick films, as the m-phase intensity largely increased in that Tanneal range; a certain por-tion of the t-phase present on top of the o-phase possibly transforms into the m-phase, while the o-phase peak inten-sities are almost invariant.. In contrast, the 2Pr values increase with increasing Tanneal up to 600�C, even though the m-phase peak also increases in that region for the 10-and 17-nm-thick films.. This must be understood from the improvement of the crystalline quality of the o-phase itself with the increasing Tanneal..",462
Faraz_2018.docx,ABSTRACT,": Oxide and nitride thin-films of Ti, Hf, and Si serve numerous applications owing to the diverse range of their material properties. It is therefore imperative to have proper control over these properties during materials processing. Ion-surface interactions during plasma processing techniques can influence the properties of a growing film. In this work, we investigated the effects of controlling ion characteristics (energy, dose) on the properties of the aforementioned materials during plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) on planar and 3D substrate topographies. We used a 200 mm remote PEALD system equipped with substrate biasing to control the energy and dose of ions by varying the magnitude and duration of the applied bias, respectively, during plasma exposure. Implementing substrate biasing in these forms enhanced PEALD process capability by providing two additional parameters for tuning a wide range of material properties. Below the regimes of ion-induced degradation, enhancing ion energies with substrate biasing during PEALD increased the refractive index and mass density of TiOx and HfOx and enabled control over their crystalline properties. PEALD of these oxides with substrate biasing at 150 °C led to the formation of crystalline material at the low temperature, which would otherwise yield amorphous films for deposition without biasing. Enhanced ion energies drastically reduced the resistivity of conductive TiNx and HfNx films. Furthermore, biasing during PEALD enabled the residual stress of these materials to be altered from tensile to compressive. The properties of SiOx were slightly improved whereas those of SiNx were degraded as a function of substrate biasing. PEALD on 3D trench nanostructures with biasing induced differing film properties at different regions of the 3D substrate. On the basis of the",393

The highly reactive plasma species generated during PEALD can provide an alternate source of the energy required for film growth. The high reactivity of the plasma species therefore, allows access to a parameter space such as low temperature deposition environments. Tuning material proper-ties during film growth at a particular temperature is typically performed by varying either the substrate material or the reactants needed for film deposition. For PEALD at any given temperature, the various parameters of plasma operating conditions (e.g., reactant gas, flow rate, pressure, power, direct/remote source configuration, etc.) allow greater freedom in processing conditions for tuning the growth and material properties of thin-films.6 Apart from the contribution of highly reactive plasma radicals toward film growth during PEALD, the ions generated by the plasma can also play a significant role during film deposition.5,6 Ion-surface interactions during plasma exposure are a character-istic feature of plasma-enhanced deposition techniques.7−10 Additional energy can be provided to the deposition surface by the kinetic energy of ions impinging on the substrate. While plasma radicals can enable film growth through their high reactivity, the additional energy delivered to the deposition surface by ion bombardment can influence a wide range of material properties of the growing film. Examples reported in the literature include tailoring of the optical refractive index, electrical conductivity, mechanical stress, mass density, crystal-line structure, morphology, surface roughness etc.9,11,12The limit to which ion-surface interactions can modify such properties depends on the energy, mass, reactivity, impingement rate (or flux) and dose (or net flux integrated over time) of ionic species impinging on the film surface.7−9,13,14On the basis of the values of these parameters, various physical, chemical or combined physicochemical processes can occur at the surface and subsurface regions of the film as the ions transfer energy and momentum during deposition. The use of an inert gas (e.g., argon) leads to predominantly physical processes which include, but are not limited to, surface or bulk atom displacements, subsurface implantation of incident ions or displaced surface atoms, desorption of adsorbed surface impurities from reactor background, etc.8,9,14The use of reactive gases (e.g., oxygen or hydrogen) involves an additional chemical or physicochemical component where the reactive ions can undergo chemical reactions forming, either stable products leading to film growth, or volatile products leading to film removal.8,10However, the processes and trends of property modulation also depend on many inherent characteristics of the growing film such as the bond energy, bond type (i.e., ionic, covalent or metallic), crystallization temperature, free energy difference between crystalline and amorphous phases or a combination of several of these parameters.14−17Given the multitude of factors that can play a role during ion-surface interactions, it is not a trivial or straightforward task to anticipate the trends in film characteristics as a result of varying the ion characteristics during deposition. Furthermore, the effects of ion-surface interactions have been extensively investigated in the literature for conventional flux-controlled processes,18such as physical vapor deposition (PVD) and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), that lead to continuous film growth.

The diverse range of applications that are heavily reliant on the properties of these materials highlights the necessity for precise control over those properties during film deposition. Enhancing ion energies with substrate biasing during PEALD on planar substrates was observed to have pronounced effects on the growth and material properties of the aforementioned thin-films. A comprehensive analysis of these properties was undertaken by characterizing the growth rate, mass density, refractive index (for dielectric materials), resistivity (for conductive materials), residual stress, and surface roughness of the films deposited on planar substrates. The role of ion energy control on film microstructure and crystallinity was also investigated. The effect of enhanced ion energies on the thickness uniformity of materials deposited on large area planar substrates (200 mm Si wafer) was also investigated compared to previous work carried out on smaller substrates.19,20Owing to the material and/or process specific effects of substrate biasing observed in previous work, an empirical investigation comprised of an extensive character-ization of film properties spanning six different materials was undertaken in this work. It was observed that substrate biasing can enhance the versatility of PEALD processes by providing two additional parameters (magnitude, duration/duty cycle of bias) for tuning a wide range of material properties. Furthermore, biasing during PEALD on 3D trench nanostructures effectively delineated the role of directional ion bombardment by inducing differing film properties at different (planar and vertical) regions of the 3D substrate.

Faraz_2018.docx,results,"demonstrate the potential of substrate biasing during PEALD in enabling routes toward topographically selective3processing on 3D substrates.■APPLYING SUBSTRATE BIAS DURING PEALD CYCLESIn a remote plasma ALD reactor configuration, the plasma source generating radicals and ions is located at a distance away from the substrate stage thus allowing the plasma and substrate conditions to be varied quite independently of each other. The ion flux impinging on the substrate can be increased by increasing the source power. When the substrate is exposed to the plasma, a positive space charge layer called the sheath is formed between the plasma and the substrate due to the difference in mobilities of the heavy ions and light electrons in the plasma. The voltage across the sheath (ΔVsheath) is the difference between the plasma potential (Vp) and the substrate potential (Vsub). The sheath voltage repels electrons from the substrate into the plasma and accelerates ions toward the substrate resulting in so-called ion bombardment. At sufficiently low pressures, the ion mean free path is larger than the plasma sheath thickness, so the ions are accelerated over the full sheath width without undergoing collisions. This collisionless plasma sheath condition leads to the highly directional or anisotropic nature of ion bombardment. Typical sheath thicknesses for processing plasmas are on the order of 10−4−10−2m, and therefore, the sheath does not follow the profile of 3D structures (e.g., trenches and vias) with micro-or nanoscale dimensions. As a result, directional ions accelerated through a collisionless sheath will mainly collide with substrate surfaces parallel to the sheath, for example, the planar top and bottom surfaces of a 3D trench nanostructure and not its vertical sidewalls. The energy (Ei) of directional ions impinging on planar substrate surfaces is proportional to the sheath voltage, as shown in equation 1C DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b00183ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch ArticleTable 1.

Faraz_2018.docx,EXPERIMENT,"AL DETAILS PEALD Process Conditions.. Film deposition using PEALD was performed in an Oxford Instruments FlexAL reactor equipped with substrate biasing (Figure 2).. The reactor consists of a radio frequency (RF) power supply (13.56 MHz, up to 600 W) connected to a water-cooled copper coil wrapped around a cylindrical alumina tube to generate an inductively coupled-plasma (ICP).. This remote RF-ICP source generates the radicals and ions during the plasma exposure step of PEALD.. For the specific FlexAL configuration, an additional external RF power supply (13.56 MHz, up to 100 W) can be connected to the reactor table that allows for substrate biasing (up to ⟨Vbias⟩ ≈ −350 V at∼10 mTorr) during plasma exposure.. Both RF power sources were connected to the system via automated matching networks consisting of inductive and capacitive components.. The FlexAL system provides a readout for ⟨Vbias⟩ when applying an RF bias signal during plasma exposure.. Additionally, an oscilloscope was connected to the reactor table via a high-voltage probe from which sinusoidal RF bias voltage waveforms developing on the table could be measured.. These oscilloscope measurements were used to independently verify ⟨Vbias⟩readouts from the FlexAL system (within ±5 V).. A base pressure in the reactor chamber of ∼10−6Torr was obtained using a turbo pump.. A butterfly valve in front of the turbo pump controlled the effective pumping speed and functioned as an automated pressure controller..

In the absence of substrate biasing during plasma exposure, (i.e., grounded substrate or ⟨Vbias⟩ = 0 V, bias duty cycle = 0%, Figure 1a) the film had a GPC of 0.48 ± 0.02 Å (Figure 3a) which is similar to the growth rate reported by Wei et al.31for TiOx deposited at the same temperature using TDMAT and O2 plasma.

The intense and narrow (101) peak indicates the presence of a highly crystalline TiO2 film with large anatase crystal grains. This is confirmed by the complementary information from the TEM image for the film deposited without biasing (Figure 5a), which shows a compact or void-free microstructure with lateral grain sizes on the order of ∼150 nm.

The maximization of compressive stress for deposition using energetic particle bombardment has been reported in the literature to be related to the formation of bombardment induced point defects, such as interstitials in the film bulk.34−37Under conditions of intense ion bombardment during film growth, the implantation of the energetic ions or the formation of subsurface interstitial atoms resulting from ion-surface interactions that push deposited atoms into the film bulk (i.e., recoil implantation or forward sputtering of knock-on atoms generated by ion-surface collisions) can increase atomic packing of the growing film.34−37This raises compressive stress as well as the mass density which scale with the concentration of those point defects.34−37The O/Ti ratio for the film deposited using−152 V applied for 10 s of plasma exposure was observed to increase to 2.2 ± 0.1 (Table 2) indicating the formation of an oxygen rich film during energetic oxygen ion bombardment. The excess oxygen can be speculated to be present as interstitial species which could stimulate an increase in compressive stress while also contributing toward elevating mass density and refractive index observed when increasing ⟨Vbias⟩ up to −152 V. Applying and steadily increasing ⟨Vbias⟩ to −152 V cause the anatase diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns (Figure 4a) to gradually decrease in magnitude while new peaks corresponding to the rutile phase of TiO2 appeared.

This onset of amorphization inducedby highly energetic ion bombardment has also been reported in the literature14,37,38and it could play a role in lowering the refractive index and mass density of the films. Furthermore, therelaxation of compressive stress on increasing ⟨Vbias⟩ beyond−152 V suggests that the yield strength of the material could havebeen exceeded under such intense ion bombardment, which could then lead to plastic deformation.14,36,39,40Theseaforementioned trends in material properties were in line with the appearance of voids in the film microstructure for TiOx deposited with ⟨Vbias⟩ greater than −152 V (Figure 5d1 and e1). The void fraction increased with increasing ⟨Vbias⟩, which could also play a role in compressive stress relaxation together withdecreasing refractive index and mass density. The surface of TiOx films initially became smoother with biasing as the RMS roughness decreased at −102 V (Figure 3e). This could be due to a combined effect of phase transformation, material densification and/or coalescence at grain boundaries due to enhanced mobility of surface species induced by energetic ions37 during film growth. The roughness increased with further increase in ⟨Vbias⟩ to −254 V, which could be attributed to the onset of void incorporation or ion bombardment induced surface damage.37The trends in RMS surface roughness obtained fromXRR were corroborated with additional measurements per-formed using atomic force microscopy (see Figure S5 and S6).Altogether, the",454

When ⟨Vbias⟩ having the same magnitude but different duty cycle was applied during theO2 plasma exposure step (i.e., the last 5 s of the 10 s plasma exposure, bias duty cycle = 50%, Figure 1c), differences were observed in the variation of TiOx film properties. The GPC again showed a trend of increasing with ⟨Vbias⟩, but at a slower rate than the 10 s bias condition reaching a comparatively lower value at−254 V (Figure 3a). This was also the case for GPC [Ti] andGPC [O] values (Table 2), which increased to comparatively lower values at −205 V applied for the shorter 5 s of plasma exposure. The refractive index and mass density of the films alsoincreased with biasing for the shorter 5 s condition, but were consistently higher than the corresponding values for filmsdeposited using the same ⟨Vbias⟩ applied for a longer duration of 10 s (Figure 3b and c). The refractive index and mass density forthe 5 s bias condition reached higher maximum values at a higher⟨Vbias⟩ of −205 V compared to the corresponding peaks at −152 V obtained using the 10 s bias condition (Figure 3b and c). The residual stress of the TiOx films again changed from tensile to compressive for the 5 s bias condition and also reached a higher maximum at a higher ⟨Vbias⟩ of −205 V compared to the maximum obtained at −152 V using the 10 s bias condition (Figure 3d). The O/Ti ratio for the film deposited using −205 V applied for the shorter duration of 5 s was 2.3 ± 0.1 (Table 2) which again indicates the formation of an oxygen rich film duringenergetic oxygen ion bombardment.

The growth and material properties of HfOx films deposited on planar substrates at 150 °C were investigated for ⟨Vbias⟩ between 0 and −280 V applied during the O2 plasma exposure step. Figure 7 shows these properties in terms of the GPC, refractive index, mass density, residual stressand surface roughness expressed as a function of ⟨Vbias⟩ applied during plasma exposure. The crystalline properties of the HfOx films can be analyzed in Figure 8 which shows grazing incidence XRD patterns for films deposited with ⟨Vbias⟩ ranging from 0 to−280 V. Additional information regarding the crystallinity and film microstructure can be obtained in Figure 9 which shows selected area electron diffraction patterns and plan-view HAADFSTEM images for HfOx deposited on planar TEM windows with and without substrate biasing.For deposition without any bias voltage, the film had a GPC of 1.03 ± 0.02 Å and a refractive index of 2.04 ± 0.03 (Figure 7a and b) which are comparable to the values reported by Sharma et al.25for HfOx deposited using TDMACpH and O2 plasma at the same temperature. The film was observed to have a mass density of 9.0± 0.2 g/cm3(Figure 7c). The lack of diffraction peaks in the XRDpattern (Figure 8) indicate the formation of amorphous HfOx deposited without biasing. This is confirmed by diffuse rings in the electron diffraction pattern (Figure 9a1) and absence oflattice fringes in the HAADF STEM image (Figure 9a2). A voidrich amorphous matrix is also revealed in the HAADF STEMimage which could explain the low mass density and refractive index of this film when compared to bulk HfOx.41,42The film had a tensile residual stress of 770 ± 50 MPa (Figure 7d) which is comparable to that reported for HfOx in previous work.30 When substrate biasing was implemented during plasmaexposure, the GPC showed a slow increase with ⟨Vbias⟩ up to−204 V (Figure 7a).

Increasing ⟨Vbias⟩ to −152 V led to higher diffraction peak intensities and narrower peak widths indicating the presence of a higher crystalline fraction and formation of larger crystal grains.43 Therefore, the observed increase in GPC, refractive index and mass density with ⟨Vbias⟩ can be initially attributed to the formation of crystalline material at −113 V, followed by an increase in crystalline content and/or grain size at −152 V. The increase in refractive index and mass density with biasing could in principle, also be due to a reduction in void content observed for the film grown without biasing. A similar increase in film crystallinity, refractive index and mass density of HfOx films was reported by Sharma et al.25due to an increase in substrate temperature. Therefore, the",942
Faraz_2018.docx,results,"obtained in this work demonstrate that enhancing the ion energy during PEALD of HfOx provides an alternate route for tuning such properties. Unlike the previous case of TiOx or any other material investigated in this work, the residual stress of HfOx showed a three stage behavior. In the first stage, the tensile residual stress of the HfOx films increased with ⟨Vbias⟩ to 1960 ± 50 MPa at −113 V (Figure 7d). This is in contrast to the trend exhibited by TiOx, which showed a change in stress from tensile to compressive when applying a similar ⟨Vbias⟩. The difference in stress behavior could be due to the difference in initial microstructure of the two films grown without biasing. TiOx deposited at a higher temperature (300 °C) yielded a highly crystalline and void-free film, whereas HfOx deposited at a lower temperature (150 °C) consisted of a void rich amorphous matrix. Therefore, when applying a similar ⟨Vbias⟩ around −100 V, TiOx changed from one void-free crystalline state to another, whereas HfOx transitioned from a disordered and porous amorphous matrix to a more ordered crystalline structure, with perhaps a lower void content. Further increase in ⟨Vbias⟩ led to the second stage in stress behavior where HfOx went from a tensile maximum at −113 V to a compressive maximum at −152 V (Figure 7d).

The use of a longer bias duration (10 s) increased nonuniformity to 2.8%, whereas the same ⟨Vbias⟩ applied for a shorter bias duration (5 s) decreased nonuniformity to 2.0% relative to the nonuniformity of the film grown without biasing (2.3%).

Film conformalities of 84% and 100% were measured at the bottom-side and bottom regions of the trench, respectively (see Figure S9). As discussed before, an increase in film GPC was observed during PEALD of TiOx with substrate biasing on planar substrates. This can cause film GPCs at the planar top and bottom surfaces of the 3D trench nanostructure to exceed the GPC at the vertical bottom-side region and thereby yield a lower conformality at that region of the 3D substrate.

Cross-sectional TEM images of SiNx layers on 3D trench nanostructures are shown in Figure 18. The images for as-deposited films grown at 500 °C without any substrate biasing and with −103 V during N2 plasma exposure are shown in Figure 18A and B, respectively. Conformalities of 37% and 56% were obtained at the bottom-side and bottom of the trench structures, respectively, for the film deposited without any⟨Vbias⟩ (Figure 18A), similar to the values reported by in our previous work28for SiNx deposited on such 3D substrates. The bottom-side film conformality improved slightly to 39% while that at the bottom improved significantly to 78% for the film deposited using −103 V during N2 plasma exposure (Figure 18B). Note that some significant corner tapering was observed for the SiNx film deposited with −103 V. The quality of these SiNx films was analyzed by measuring their etch resistance in dilute hydrofluoric acid solution (HF:H2O = 1:100). The as-deposited films underwent a 30 s wet-etch treatment in dilute HF and cross-sectional TEM images of the films were measured after the etch treatment. Figure 18A′ and B′ show the post wet-etch TEM images of the films deposited without any substrate biasing and with −103 V applied during N2 plasma exposure, respectively. The wet-etch rate (WER) values were determined by comparing the as-deposited and post wet-etch film thicknesses at three different regions (top, bottom-side, bottom) of the 3D trench nanostructures which are outlined in Table 6. The SiNx film deposited without biasing seemed to be highly etch resistant at the planar top and bottom regions of the trench as indicated by the small or insignificant WER values (≤1 ± 1 nm/ min, Table 6) at those regions. These low WERs indicate the formation of high quality SiNx films on planar top and bottom surfaces of the 3D trench nanostructures for deposition without any substrate biasing. This is also in agreement with the high mass density, refractive index (Figure 15b, c) and low impurity content (Table 4) of SiNx deposited without biasing on a planar c-Si substrate, as discussed earlier. The WER observed at the bottom-side region of the trench (3 ± 1 nm/min, Table 6) is relatively higher than those at the two planar trench regions, indicating a reduced HF-etch resistance of SiNx at the vertical trench sidewalls. However, the value is small in absolute magnitude indicating an overall high HF-etch resistance at both planar and vertical trench surfaces for the film deposited without substrate biasing. For the SiNx film deposited with −103 V during N2 plasma exposure, the film regions located at the planar top and bottom surfaces of the trench exhibited very high WERs and were completely removed after the etch treatment (Figure 18B′). These high WERs indicate the degradation of SiNx films on planar top and bottom surfaces of the 3D trench nanostructures for deposition with substrate biasing. This is corroborated by the lower refractive index, mass density (Figure 15b, c) and higher impurity content (Table 4) observed earlier for SiNx deposited on planar substrates using −103 V during N2Q DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b00183ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch Articleagain be explained by the combined factors of high energy and directionality of ions traveling through a nearly collisionless plasma sheath when ⟨Vbias⟩ is applied to the substrate. These energetic ions collide with much more energy on the horizontal top and bottom surfaces of the 3D trenches than the vertical sidewalls. Consequently, the SiNx films growing at the top and bottom trench regions are selectively degraded in comparison to those growing at the sidewalls. As a result, the film regions obtained at those sidewalls for deposition with substrate biasing retain the high quality and HF-etch resistance inherent for films formed at the same vertical surfaces for deposition without any⟨Vbias⟩.■",991
Faraz_2018.docx,results,"obtained in this work demonstrate how substrate biasing during PEALD can have prominent effects on the growth or material properties of oxide and nitride thin-films. In the case of the four transition metal compounds, the trends in material properties as a function of ⟨Vbias⟩ mostly showed a two stage behavior composed of an initial buildup (or decrease) followed by a gradual fall (or increase) with increasing ⟨Vbias⟩. These trends observed for the large range of ⟨Vbias⟩ investigated in this work enabled identification of regimes for material property improvement (i.e., higher refractive index, conductivity, and mass density) and degradation in PEALD processes. ⟨Vbias⟩ up to approximately −150 V during O2 plasma exposure and −130 V during H2 or Ar + H2 plasma exposure improved material properties of the transition metal oxide and nitride films, respectively. Applying ⟨Vbias⟩ beyond these values showed material property degradation. For silicon oxide and silicon nitride, a one stage behavior was observed where material properties improved slightly for the former and instantly degraded for the latter as a function of substrate biasing. Besides varying ⟨Vbias⟩ magnitude, reducing the duration of substrate biasing during plasma exposure extended the ⟨Vbias⟩ regime for improving TiOx material properties to about −200 V. These",302
Faraz_2018.docx,results,"indicate that regimes exist not only for the ion energy but also for the dose of higher energy ions. Consequently, both the magnitude of ⟨Vbias⟩ and the duration/duty cycle of the applied bias can be used as tunable parameters for influencing ion-surface interactions by modifying the ion energy and dose/fluence of higher energy ions, respectively. It is interesting to note that even though an H2 plasma generates lighter ions (e.g., H3+, H2+) than an Ar + H2 plasma (e.g., ArH+, Ar+), similar trends in material properties were observed for the two transition metal nitrides when grown using these two plasmas with substrate biasing. This will be investigated in future work on the basis of growing a transition metal nitride using these plasmas with substrate biasing and measuring the corresponding ion characteristics (e.g., energy, flux, etc.) and material properties. Furthermore, the trends in material property variation reported for substrate biasing during conventional flux-controlled deposition processes (PECVD or PVD) are similar to those observed in the surface-controlled PEALD processes of this work for all films44,57−60 except SiNx. Enhancing ion energies during PEALD of SiNx with relatively small ⟨Vbias⟩ (<−100 V) lowered mass density, refractive index, and compressive stress while simultaneously increasing WER which are opposite to the trends reported for SiNx PECVD or PVD processes with substrate biasing.61,62Even for substrate biasing during PEALD, the mass density of TiOx as a function of ⟨Vbias⟩ increased for films in this work but decreased for films deposited in previous work reported by Profijt et al.,R DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b00183ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch Articlecontent could have an influence on the material work function.66 The decrease in [O] content enabled by substrate biasing during a reducing plasma could in principle, be applicable for varying the composition of metal oxide films deposited with precursors containing metal−O bonds. Recently, it was shown that substoichiometric TaOx films could be obtained with PEALD using Ta(OC2H5)5 as the precursor (that already contained Ta−O bonds), followed by a reducing Ar + H2 plasma.67This process scheme led to the incorporation of oxygen vacancies in the deposited metal oxide. In this regard, it can be speculated that enhancing ion energies during the reductive plasma step could potentially confer in situ control over the amount of generated oxygen vacancies. As a result, PEALD with substrate biasing could be a method for growing substoichiometric metal oxide layers with a tunable composition, relevant for emerging applications such as resistive nonvolatile memory devices (e.g., RRAMs).68 Substrate biasing during PEALD has thus far been implemented in the second step of a two-step PEALD process, that is, during the B step of an (AB)n process where n is the number of cycles. It could also be implemented in multistep PEALD processes, such as during the third C step of an (ABC)n cycle or an [(AB)xC]n supercycle, where x is the number of AB cycles completed before the C step is performed and n is the number of supercycles (see Figures S1 and S2).18Furthermore, substrate biasing during PEALD has so far been carried out using reactive plasmas where enhancing ion energies result in combined physicochemical process during film growth. Using an inert plasma (e.g., Ar) in the C step of the aforementioned multistep cycles and applying a bias only at that step could in principle, lead to purely physical effects during energetic ion bombardment. Such purely physical processes could induce differences in the trends of material property variation as a function of substrate biasing. Other variants of multistep PEALD supercycles are used to deposit layered film stacks (or nanolaminates69) that rely on the differences in properties of the individual layers. These differences are generally procured by growing at least two different materials alternately for the stacked layers. Since enhanced ion energies during PEALD can tailor the properties of a given material, stacked layers with different properties using the same material could in principle, be created by growing one layer without (Figure 1a) and the next layer with substrate biasing (Figure 1b or c). This technique could also be employed for growing films on sensitive substrates that cannot withstand the effects of enhanced ion energies. Deposition with biasing can be carried out only after initially performing some PEALD (or even thermal ALD) cycles without any biasing on such substrates. This could in principle, lead to energetic ion-surface interactions on the initial layer of the deposited film and not on the substrate (provided the initially grown layer is of a sufficient thickness). For stacked layers comprised of different materials, substrate biasing during PEALD can enable better control over the properties of those layers, for example, by reducing tensile stress of HfO2 layers in HfO2/Al2O3 bilayers to prevent delamination.30Film growth with steadily increasing/ decreasing bias voltages with each subsequent cycle could also enable tailoring of interface properties, for example, formation of a gradually changing instead of an abrupt interface.Furthermore, substrate biasing during plasma exposure can also be implemented as pre- or postdeposition treatment steps which, based on the reactants used and the treatment duration, can modify surface or subsurface regions (i.e., a few monolayers below the surface). This can enable in situ surface functionaliza-S DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b00183ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch Articlesheath. The gas-phase collisions could also lead to the impingement of both ions and radicals on the vertical surfaces of a 3D structure. Depending on the pressure and magnitude of substrate bias applied during plasma exposure, the energy of the ions and radicals colliding with sidewalls could in principle, be higher than the energy of the same species interacting with the sidewalls in a nearly collisionless plasma sheath. This could have direct implications on the conformality and material properties of films deposited on 3D substrates. Therefore, substrate biasing during PEALD on 3D substrates with highly collisional plasma exposures offer new avenues for investigation.■",1380
Faraz_2018.docx,CONCLUSION,"S The effects of modifying ion-surface interactions during PEALD on the growth and material properties of oxide (TiOx, HfOx, SiOx) and nitride (TiNx, HfNx, SiNx) thin-films have been investigated using a commercial 200 mm remote plasma ALD system equipped with RF substrate biasing. The magnitude of⟨Vbias⟩ and the duration/duty cycle of the applied bias during plasma exposure were demonstrated as parameters for influencing ion-surface interactions by modifying the ion energy and dose/fluence of higher energy ions, respectively. Controlling these parameters had significant material and/or process specific effects that enabled tailoring of a wide range of properties during film growth. These include, but are not limited to, the mass density, optical refractive index, electrical resistivity, residual stress, crystalline properties (e.g., volume fraction, phase, grain size, etc.), void fraction, surface roughness, thickness uniformity (on large area planar substrates), and chemical composition, which are summarized in Figure 19.As long as ion energies remained below the regimes for ion-induced degradation, enhancing ion energies by increasing⟨Vbias⟩ led to an improvement in the mass density for all materials except SiNx, which degraded with substrate biasing. A higher mass density was generally accompanied by an increase in the optical refractive index of dielectric films. Growth of a denser material with biasing also indicated the presence of a compact film with a void-free microstructure while the growth of underdense material generally led to an increase in the film void content. Enhancing ion energies with substrate biasing significantly reduced the electrical resistivity of the two transition metal nitrides. This was also accompanied by a significant reduction of the oxygen impurity content in TiNx while implementing a high ⟨Vbias⟩ elevated the film carbon content. These serve to demonstrate how substrate biasing can be used for tuning the chemical composition of materials. The residual stress could be tailored from tensile under no bias conditions to compressive with substrate biasing for the transition metal compounds whereas that for the silicon compounds remained compressive as a function of ⟨Vbias⟩.Substrate biasing during PEALD on 3D trench nanostructures effectively depicted the role of directional ion bombardment by inducing distinct film properties at different surface orientations (planar and vertical) of the 3D substrate. For TiOx and HfOx at low temperature, biasing led to phase selective growth of crystalline material on planar surfaces and amorphous material on vertical sidewalls of the trenches. For SiNx, biasing led to microstructure selective degradation of film regions growing at planar surfaces of the trenches but not those growing at vertical sidewalls. These",594

In recent years, ferroelectric (FE) FETs have been",73
vanHoudt_Nur_FeFET_steepness_JEDS_2018.docx,experiment,"ally demonstrated to break this limit [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]. Despite such successful demonstrations, some critical challenges need to be addressed for the FEFET to be of use to the industry. Firstly, a FE material is needed to be compatible with the existing CMOS processing technology, i.e., deposited by ALD. In addition, as FE films are known to lose its ferroelectric properties below certain critical thickness, the material to be used must possess its ferroelectricity at a thickness that would allow metal gate and gate dielectric (DE) to fit in the fin-to-fin space and gate trench. Previously, doped HfO2 has been demonstrated to meet these criteria. However, in doped HfO2, the required mole fraction for Si, Al, Y, Gd, La and Sr as a dopant are less than 15% to get the FE phase [9]. Such dopants can be used in the thick FE oxide-based devices but may become impractical in ultra-scaled ones. In this work we therefore use planar n-channel FEFET fabricated by gate-last process with Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 FE gate oxide as it is more scalable. Even though the gate stack is not optimized for steep slope operation [10], the devices show < 60 mV/dec threshold under certain measurement conditions. We discuss possible mechanisms contributing to the device hysteresis, the hysteresis vs. subthreshold slope tradeoff and we report the effect of oxide thickness, lateral scaling, anneal and measurement temperatures, and bias voltage on trapping and polarization behavior [11]. Charge trapping in the gate oxide of FET originates from oxide defects and leads to various degradation effects, such as bias temperature instability (BTI) [12]. These defects can be located at any spatial position within the oxide as well as can have different ionization energies. In this extended work [11] we extract the defect energy band active in our Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 n-channel FEFET from Non-radiative Multi-Phonon (NMP) theory using BTI-like methodology [13] below the device ferroelectric coercive voltage. Finally, we propose a simple method to separate the trapping and ferroelectric behavior in the FEFET during ID-VG characterization using transient-current measurements. II.",530

The high-k oxide of 3nm, 5nm and 8nm thickness has been deposited using ALD, followed by the deposition of 10nm TiN on top of the oxide as gate metal. Finally, to crystallize the oxide, post-metallization-annealing was done at 5000C, 5500C and 6000C. The interfacial SiO2 layer has a thickness of 0.8nm. Fabricated devices have the dimensions (width × gate length) of 10m×10m, 1m×1m and 1m×70nm. The GIXRD data shown in Fig. 1 confirm that we have properly crystallized oxide. In the 8nm HfZrO,we have ~40% of the oxide crystallized as orthorhombic phase (the rest are a mixture of other, non-polar phases), needed to induce FE behavior. Al doped HfO2 based FET was fabricated in which the oxide did not show ferroelectric behavior. To compare the performance of FEFETs, we also fabricated other dielectric (DE) FETs of the same device dimensions with HfO2 and SiO2 as gate oxide. Neither of the reference HfO2 stacks received a high-temperature anneal.

Hysteresis in the transfer characteristics is clockwise for Vm = 2V, which is typical for CS trapping behavior (cf. Fig. 2). When compared against the non-ferroelectric DEFET, the ferroelectric device shows a larger threshold voltage and a poorer SS. As Vm is increased, the hysteresis changes direction. This is typically explained as a wakeup (or polarization) of the FE oxide followed by polarization switching.

Above Vstress – Vth ~ 1.2 V, Eox is high enough for the FE oxide to start polarizing during the stress phase, resulting in negative Vth during the measurement phase.. The defect band properties in the FE oxide can therefore be extracted from the measurements at Vstress – Vth < 1.2 V. Electrically active defects such as oxygen vacancies are commonly observed in high-k oxides like HfO2, ZrO2 and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 [23]..

Up till now, many studies have shown the stability of FeRAM fabricated by lead zirconate titanate (PZT) under radiation environment [4], [5]. However, the scaling problem and poor CMOS compatibility of traditional ferro-electric materials impedes further development of high density, radiation hard FeRAM. HfO2 has been widely adopted as the industry standard gate dielectric in logic and memory devices [6]. Recently reported ferroelectric properties in doped HfO2 triggered the interest in application of these materials in ferroelectric memories [7], which may overcome the scaling problem of traditional ferroelectric memories such as PZT. However, up to now, there has been no report addressing the radiation effects to HfO2-based FeRAM devices.

Device parameters such as material structures, leakage current, permittivity, remanent polarization (Pr), endurance and fatigue characteristics are analyzed before and after radiation conditions.

At the pristine state, diffraction peaks from an orthorhombic phase of HfO2 which contributes to the ferroelectricity are observed.. After 5.4 Mrad and 10.8 Mrad radiation, the peak positions and half peak widths are not significantly altered.. No diffraction peaks from other phases emerge.. The little intensity difference may be caused by the variation of sample position between tests.. Therefore, the radiation causes no distinct effect on the crystal structures.. The current density-electric field (J-E) curves of one device before and after radiation are shown in Fig.. 1(b).. The J-E curve was measured by ramping the voltage from 0 V to 3.6 V and then from 0 V to -3.6 V. Polarization switching current is observed at around ±1.1 MV/cm.. After radiation, the leakage current density increases slightly from 1.29 ×10−7A/cm2to 1.56 ×10−7A/cm2at -1.8 MV/cm.. It has been inves-tigated that the O−2 and oxygen vacancies are induced in HfO2 thin films by the γ ray [9].. Therefore, an increase of leakage current can be induced by these defects.. The leakage current is highly stable after expo-sure to γ ray radiation.. This is quite different from previous reports in Bi3.25La0.75Ti3O12 (BLT) [10], and Bi3.15Nd0.85Ti3O12 (BNT) [11] FeRAM devices where the leakage current decreases or increases dramatically after radi-ation, respectively..

This phenomenon can be explained as the sample contains the maximum concentration of domain walls at the coercive field (corresponding to lower cycling fields) and the wall pinning can take place more easily. The cycling field depen-dence of fatigue also conforms with our previous report [8]. As shown in Fig. 3, all devices show similar fatigue behavior as their pristine state after 10.8 Mrad radiation. The little 2Pr difference is caused by the sample to sample variation.bias during the radiation are shown in Fig. 4. Since devices were easy to break down at high electric fields after the bonding process, we chose a relatively lower electric field of 1.6 MV/cm to measure the hysteresis loop. The hysteresis loops show little distortion or shift after radiation, which indicates that defects induced by the radiation do not make distinct domain wall pinning in the films. This is in stark contrast to PZT [14] based FeRAM devices. To exclude the effect of applied bias electric field on the hysteresis loops, we also did a control test by only applying electric field but without radiation for the same time. The result is shown in Fig. 4(b). Similar to the result in Fig. 4(a), the hysteresis loops show no obvious changes. The characteristic parameters of our device before and after radiation are summarized in Table I. We also list the radiation-hardened properties of other ferroelectric materials. As can be seen in Table I, devices based on HYO ferroelectric films have better scalability and much higher radiation-hardened stability.IV.",343

Finally, a circuit model of the ferroelectric memory device isB Milan Peši´c Milan.pesic@namlab.comIn the age of mobile devices nonvolatile memories have become an essential part of every electronic system. Tra-ditionally, nonvolatile memories are limited with respect to rewrite speed and cycling endurance due to the so-called voltage time dilemma [1]. Additionally, the high voltages required during the rewrite process make their integra-tion into scaled complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes more and more complicated. The stable remanent polarization at zero electric field together with the fact that the polarization can be switched by an electrical field makes ferroelectrics a natural choice to realize a nonvolatile memory [2,3]. Therefore, already in the 1950s the concept of a ferroelectric memory was proposed [4] and first attempts were made to realize solid state memories based on the ferro-electric Bariumtitanate [5,6]. However, these attempts were based on pure cross-point arrays and the resulting disturb issues could not be solved.

Since the readout of a ferroelec-tric capacitor is based on the charge that is transferred during switching [1] a 3-dimensional capacitor would be required below 100 nm groundrules. This is adding new integration challenges for the complex materials not only of the ferro-electric itself but also the required metal-oxide electrodes. For this challenge no solution can be provided yet [10,11]. Therefore, the development of such perovskite-based mem-ories were successful but at the same time seem to have hit a wall at about the 100 nm groundrules [12]. Another path to scale the memory cell without going into the third dimen-sion is the integration of the functional ferroelectric film into a field-effect transistor. Such an approach, called the ferro-2 Engineering the material: ab-initio studyThe observation of ferroelectricity in thin hafnia films has been surprising since the most stable monoclinic P21/c phase, the high-temperature tetragonal P42/nmc and cubic Fm3m phases and the high pressure orthorhombic Pbca phase (the well-known equilibrium phases) are centrosymmetric and nonpolar.

With a combined transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoscale electron diffraction study, Sang et al. [26] were able to identify the Pca21 phase in a thin, ferroelectric hafnia film with some uncertainty with regardelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) was proposed already to the Pbca phase.in the late 1950s [13,14]. However, perovskite or layered perovskite ferroelectrics like lead–zirconate–titanate (PZT) and strontium–bismuth–tantalate (SBT) in contact with sil-icon require an interface buffer layer to avoid silicidation reactions. Due to the high permittivity of perovskites it is nearly impossible to match the permittivity of the ferroelec-tric with a nonferroelectric interface layer while trying to reduce the gate stack thickness. An internal depolarization field under zero applied voltage is the consequence leading to poor data retention [15]. Using hafnium oxide as the inter-face layer between a very thick SBT layer and silicon [16], nonvolatile retention could be demonstrated. However, the thickness requirements for the SBT layer hinder the scaling of such devices to the deep sub-100 nm regime as well.The discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide by Boescke et al. [17] may resolve these historic issues of ferro-electric memory devices explained above. Hafnium oxideDensity functional theory (DFT) total energy calculations qualitatively mostly agree that the Pca21 phase of hafnia is the second most stable phase with about 60 meV/f.u., fol-lowed by the tetragonal phase with 95 meV/f.u. (relative to monoclinic). The considerably different values for the energy differences result from different density functionals where the local density approximation (LDA) typically gives smaller and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) larger energy differences. Further theoretical uncertainty arises from d-orbitals in standard DFT which can be better described with more sophisticated methods like DFT+U or HSE (some examples are shown in Fig. 1a).",537

For zirconia, the energy difference between the competing ferroelectric and tetrago-nal phase becomes very small and the free energy (Fig. 1b) nearly vanishes.

In pure hafnia, the ferroelectric phase free energy is about 50 meV/f.u. relative to the monoclinic ground state such that it can be only stabilized in extremely thin films [27]. On the other hand, in pure zirconia the tetrag-onal phase is only a few meV/f.u. close to the ferroelectric phase such that an external electric field is sufficient to induce its stability [28,29]. Around the 50% mixture of hafnia and zirconia the ferroelectric phase is very stable under thin film conditions (up to a thickness of about 25 nm).Hf1−xZrxO2 is a model system for ferroelectric phase sta-bilization with a dopant.

In contrast to the pyro-electric and electrocaloric applications, phase transitions are highly undesired in memory application. Nonetheless, for reaching the desired phase stability it is important to investi-gate its dependencies. The free energy for each phase φ can be calculated asFφ = Uφ − T Sφ + �0,φ Dφ Eφ + �0,φσi j,φs ji,φ + �φ, (2)where �0,φ denotes the volume of a formula unit of the phase, Eφ the electric field, D the dielectric displacement, S the vibrational entropy, σij and sij stress and strain tensor, respectively, and �φ a surface energy contribution.J Comput Electron (2017) 16:1236–125612398024normalized Pr (Pr/Pr_max)1Silicon content increaseFree energy [meV/f.u.]60P42/nmc T=80K0.80.6400.4200.20 100200300400500Temperature [K]0P42/nmc T=230K P42/nmc T=300KMeasured Simulated-20Pbca1 T=80K, T=230K, T=300KFig. 3 Remanent polarization in Si: HfO2 for different doping cat% as-4-20a function of temperatureEz [MV/cm]Fig. 2 Free energy as a function of the electric field in the polarizationdirection Ez and the temperature for the tetragonal and ferroelectric phase of ZrO2 related to the monoclinic phase.

This allows the ferroelectric phase stabilization at the phase boundary to the tetragonal phase by lowering the temperature, as shown in [41].The impact of an electric field on the free energy was stud-ied by Materlik et al. [29] to explain the anti-ferroelectric (AFE) behavior in thin ZrO2 as an electric field-induced phase transformation and by Batra et al. [42] to explore phase stabilization by internal fields. For a field strength of 1 MV/cm the value of �0DE is 10 meV/f.u., Fig. 2 shows the calculated scenario of AFE behavior as field-induced phase transition which fits to the observation of [41] in thin zirconia. These findings are of high importance for the stabilization of the distinct material into novel AFE nonvolatile memorieseffect to stabilize the ferroelectric phase [30]. The required stress depends on the energy difference value to be overcome (see Fig. 1), which fluctuate for different DFT methods. In [30] it was shown that a planar, compressive strain of 1% (which corresponds to a stress of about 3 GPa) is required for stabilization of the ferroelectric phase. Materlik et al. [29] calculated the required stress to be 8 GPa which seems unre-alistic high and therefore, a surface energy mechanism was proposed. Finally, Batra et al. [42] assumed a combination of 2% compressive strain together with an internal electric field of 1.5 MV/cm. Although stress or strain can play a role in stabilization of the ferroelectric phase in hafnia and zirco-nia, it seems that the first-order effect must lay in some other phenomenon.So far, we have treated phase stability in the thermo-dynamic picture with the free energy. If large barriers are involved in a transition, kinetic effects may become visible. The transition barrier from the tetragonal to the ferroelec-tric phase has been calculated by several authors [29–31] being about 30 meV/f.u. and of first order. The transition bar-[22,23]. rier from monoclinic to ferroelectric has not been reported,From Eqs. (1 and 2) one would expect a temperature induced phase transition to the tetragonal or cubic phase at a fixed temperature (the Curie temperature). In Si doped HfO2 [40] a large interval of transition temperatures has been found (see Fig. 3). This has been explained with the surface or interface energy contribution �φ which differs for grains of different size in the film. Since the derivative of Pr with respect to T is the pyroelectric coefficient (sum of proper and giant, phase transition induced contribution), the perspective is to tailor the temperature range and magnitude of the pyro-electric coefficient with Si-doping as well as the grain sizebut should be much larger around 210 meV/f.u., accord-ing to [43]. This raises the question whether a field-induced transformation from monoclinic to ferroelectric is possible; however, there is no clear evidence so far.Polarization reversal is a special case of phase transition. Huan et.al.

In contrast to the typical observa-tion in perovskite-based ferroelectrics this trend of binary oxides is very favorable for the integration of ferroelectrics in ultimately scaled devices.

Furthermore, the term γφ(x) depends on the dopant concentration x. In [29] a free energy model for Hf1−xZrxO2 was developed with a linear dependence of the crystal free energies and �φ on x (due to the good sol-ubility of HfO2 in ZrO2 and vice versa). Hence, resulting in x linear free energies Fφ(x) for each phase where the intersections define the phase boundaries. Depending on the hafnia–zirconia mixtures, naturally a window of stable ferro-electric phase in x appears, varying with thickness, as shown in Fig. 6. This model is considered to describe the thickness dependence of the ferroelectric phase in Hf1−xZrxO2. Gen-erally, for other doped hafnia films, a part of the stabilization is achieved with the dopant and the thickness dependence could be modeled with the surface energy contribution. In [45] the model reported in [29] has been refined with proper inclusion of the grain size distribution. By using total ener-gies from DFT, data can be reproduced quite well, however, the values for γφ(x) are taken from a fit. Batra et al.

To address the polycrystalline nature of the film, the modeled hafnia ferroelectric layer is divided into randomly distributed grains and two interface layers next to the electrodes.. The granular morphology and grain boundaries play very impor-tant roles since they behave as the preferable locations for the accumulation of the VO-s.. In order to model the variability in the resulting switching characteristics, each of the modeled grains should represents an averaged ensemble of domains with similar properties.. Each ensemble is defined by a dis-tinct coercive field, remanent polarization value and k-value.. The coercive fields used for the ensembles can be chosen based on the switching densities observed in the First-Order Reversal Curve (FORC) [62] distributions (see Fig.. 9b).. In Ref.. [63,64] it was reported that grains can be correlated with discrete ferroelectric domains and switching events within highly scaled FeFETs (details and modeling approach will J Comput Electron (2017) 16:1236–1256 1243 be discussed in Sect.. 4).. Further to address the phase transi-tion with field cycling, different phases of the doped hafnia, which can coexist inside the same grain: (a) the orthorhombic phase, responsible for the ferroelectric switching; (b) mon-oclinic, which are not active from the ferroelectric point of view and (c) tetragonal phases, responsible for AFE behavior should be taken into account [41,55]..",505

Moreover, based on a TEM study [55] the pristine condition (and internal bias) was generated considering the nonswitching interfaces which possess different k-value with respect to the switching fractions of the film which conse-quently affects the distribution of the local fields. In addition to the low-k value this additional local internal bias field com-ponent was created by highest density of the vacancies in the interfacial regions [55,65].This scenario was used to simulate the preferable move-ment of the O vacancies driven by the applied electric field. Simulation of bipolar stress cycling revealed that O vacancies redistribute uniformly within the grain [55]. In addition to this drift/diffusion process, recombination can occur.

In addition domain de-pinning was represented by removing the charges previ-ously located at the electrode interfaces, whereas the phase transformation was included by changing of the respective k-values and setting the portions of interface as well as the previously nonswitching grains to a ferroelectric active state. These modifications resulted in merging of the current peaks or in other words the opening of the hysteresis curve (Fig. 10), that completely emulates the behavior of the real device.It should be noted that even the film is woken-up, due to the polycrystalline nature of the film, a slight deviation of",386

The subsequent charge trapping on this generated defects signifi-cantly influences the local field distribution across the device stack. The field over the interface increases, while it reduces inside the ferroelectric bulk [59,65]. As a consequence, the ferroelectric layer (switching/active part of the device) expe-riences a lower field, which leads to a reduced number of switching domains and decrease in the MW.In Refs. [55,59] the modeling of the degradation and its influence on the ferroelectric switching was performed.

Even though var-ious studies reported modeling of the memory window of FeFETs, rather few addressed the limitations caused by switching kinetics and nucleation of the domains in ulti-mately scaled devices. Exactly these properties together with multigrain operation and multilevel-cell (MLC) possibilities will be addressed. Moreover, an overview of the progress in understanding on the neighboring cell disturb through the mix-mode simulations will be reviewed. For this purpose, a 2D multi grain model of the FeFET device was utilized (see Fig. 13). Details about the model development can be foundpolarization–voltage characteristic is depicted in Fig. 12a, in [71,83].123J Comput Electron (2017) 16:1236–125612474.1 Switching kinetics–nucleation-limited modelThe polarization reversal in the ferroelectric films is influ-enced by various parameters. Among others these are struc-tural and geometric properties of the film as well as electric, thermal and mechanic excitation parameters. For instance, the polycrystalline nature of the film (see Sect. 3 for details), the duration and amplitude of the applied electric field, and the temperature are some of the most important ones. The switching kinetics has both theoretical and practical rele-vance, because it directly impacts the performance of the device containing the ferroelectric.Many modeling approaches concerning the switching kinetics have been proposed in order to explain the domain nucleation and growth within the material and to relate these processes to the macroscopic electrical manifesta-tions. Two models are generally accepted in this regard. The Kolmogorov–Avrami–Ishibashi (KAI) model is based on the nucleation and propagation of reversed domains [84]. Here, the coercive voltage VC, obtained as the intersection between the P–V hysteretic curve and the voltage axis, follows the simple power law relationship VC ∝ fβ, where f is the exci-tationsignalfrequencyandβ thefittingparameter.Themodel has been successfully applied for bulk crystals and cleanFig. 14 Field and time dependence of ferroelectric switching in ultra-scaled FeFETs. a Gate voltage waveform with logarithmically increasing pulse width tPW.

On the other hand, polycrystalline disor-dered ferroelectrics strongly deviate from this relation [86]and therefore, several domain nucleation switching limiting (NLS) models have been proposed [86,87]. In these NLS models, the time of domain wall movement is neglected com-pared to the nucleation time. A particularly suitable model for describing field and temperature dependent polarization switching is the one proposed by Du and Chen [87]. Here, the nucleating domains must overcome a critical size defined by an attractive potential. Following a similar approach of Merz [88] for the free energy of domain nucleation within the framework of the classical nucleation theory, a simple expression for the average nucleation waiting time can beswitching kinetics by applying proper programming pulses at the gate electrode, and assessing the resulting polarization state by determining the threshold voltage VT of the transis-tor. To this purpose, the gate voltage pulse sequence shown in Fig. 14a is adopted. The VN pulse sets the device in the high-VT state and with the following VP pulse an attempt is done to reverse the polarization and set the low-VT state. Due to the fact that the switching of single domains is a stochastic process when they are excited in the proximity of their coercive voltage, the",1331

This strongly hints at the stochastic switching governed by a Poisson process.In following the switching in thin films will be modeled and discussed using a purely nucleation-limited approach. Given the small size of grains (the mean grain radius is 10 nm), it is a reasonable assumption that they contain onlyior of the ferroelectric hafnium oxide at the domain level, one domain [89].ultra-scaled FeFET were characterized. Due to the ultimately reduced device size, the gate stack contains only one or a few ferroelectric domains, which control the channel conductiv-ity [1,19]. In this way, it is relatively easy to monitor theirWe start by supposing that upon the application of the electric field the switching is initiated when a relatively small number of critical nuclei are generated within one grain. The generation rate is given by λ = 1/τ in Eq. (11). Within this1231248J Comput Electron (2017) 16:1236–1256picture, the polarization of the grain is considered reversed when a certain critical number n of generated nuclei merge (a) measured (b) simulatedtogether into a single domain occupying the entire grain. Assuming the nucleation to be the Poisson process, the time elapsing between each critical nucleus generation �Ti will be exponentially distributed asp�Ti = λ e−λ �Ti(12)where p�Ti is the probability density function of �Ti . Thus the overall domain switching time will be given by the sumof n individual �Ti intervals corresponding to the number ofcritical nuclei necessary to form the domain:Fig. 15 a Discrete switching events for both PRG (black) and ERS (red) of the cell. b Simulation of the discrete switching based on the 2D multigrain TCAD model of FeFET (Color figure online)tSW =�n i=1�Ti (13)with the mean and variance given by Eqs.

Considering an aver-age grain diameter in the order of 10 nm, these ultra-scaled devices (gate length = 28 nm and width = 80 nm) are expected to contain about two to four ferroelectric grains. Further scal-ing of the device while preserving the grain/domain size would result in increased variability of the MW and hence might influence the behavior of the whole array. However, different technological measures can be adopted to coun-teract that issue by decreasing grain size or increasing the uniformity of the ferroelectric film properties.Here, each discrete switching event which abruptly shifts the VT isrepresentedwithadiscretestepin VT characteristics.

Instead, it can be concluded that for the purposes ofthe simulation of discrete switching events and addressing of the single-domain switching kinetics a Landau–Khalatnikov (L–K, see Sect. 4.3 for details) model for emulation of fer-roelectrics is necessary. Detail about the L–K model and its advantages will be addressed in following section.Fig. 16 a Landau free energy potential as a function of the applied field E. b Polarization–electric field hysteresis calculated from (a)(LK) equation is applied [92]:4.3 Landau–Khalatnikov modelρ ∂ P∂t= − ∂u∂ P,(17)Starting purely from symmetry considerations, Landau the-ory is a powerful tool for describing a multitude of phase transition phenomena based on thermodynamic free energy potentials [90]. This phenomenological approach was first applied by Devonshire to model phase transitions in ferro-electricmaterials [91]. Closetothetransitiontemperature TC, a high symmetry paraelectric phase transforms into a lower symmetry ferroelectric phase. The simplest way to describe this phase transition is by doing a series expansion of the free energy u using the order parameter P, which is the electrical polarization:u = αP2+ β P4+ γ P6− E P. (16)Here, α, β, γ are the ferroelectric anisotropy constants and E is the electric field in the ferroelectric. Below TC, for second-order phase transitions, α < 0, β > 0 and γ = 0, whereas for first-order phase transitions α < 0, β < 0 and γ > 0. Figure 16a shows the free energy as a function of P for differ-ent applied fields Efor a second-order transition. Without an applied field there are two degenerate energy minima corre-sponding to the remanent polarization states (+Pr and −Pr). Whenafield E isapplied,oneminimumisbecomingenerget-ically more favorable while the other one increases in energy and ultimately vanishes at the coercive field EC. By differ-entiating Eq. (16) with respect to P and setting du/dP = 0, we obtain the S-shaped P–E relationship corresponding to the polarization hysteresis as shown in Fig. 16b. It should be noted here, that in the case shown in Fig. 16b the switching at E = EC would be instantaneous, which is obviously not physical. Therefore, to calculate more realistic switching dynamics based on the free energy in Eq. (16), the Landau–Khalatnikovwhere ρ is a damping constant of dimension [�m], which corresponds to the internal resistivity of the ferroelectric which limits the change of P with time. In case of Fig. 16b, ρ would be zero.It should be noted, that this is a mean-field theory which assumes homogeneous properties throughout the whole fer-roelectric. While this is obviously not true for polycrystalline thin films like HfO2, we will show how inhomogeneities can be incorporated into the Landau–Devonshire model. A gen-eral extension of the model to include a gradient term (∇ P)2 was proposed by Ginzburg and Landau [93], which is also used in more complex ferroelectric phase field models [94]. However, we will propose a simpler approach to describe HfO2-based ferroelectrics, which is much less computation intensive than phase field models and much more accurate than homogeneous Landau theory.Generally, LK models based on homogeneous Landau–Devonshire theory are not suited to describe polarization switching in ferroelectric thin films, since local effects like domain nucleation and growth are known to govern polariza-tion reversal [95]. Therefore, a modified LK approach was proposed [96], where the ferroelectric film is partitioned into smaller regions, which are electrically in parallel and are each described by Eqs. (16) and (17). By introducing spatial dis-tributions of the parameters α, β, γ and ρ, nonuniformity of the film can be modeled [96].In the case of HfO2-based ferroelectrics, the polycrys-tallinity and grain structure is especially of interest. Some grains might be paraelectric and therefore can be modeled as a regular linear capacitance in parallel. Each ferroelectric grain, on the other hand, is described by the LK-equation. Then, in case of a ferroelectric capacitor with two metal elec-1231250J Comput Electron (2017) 16:1236–1256iFGrain 1Grain 2Grain NLeakageDielectric GrainsiF1iF2iFNiLiCDR1R2RNVVVVFi1 (P1)CF1i2 (P2)CF2iN (PN)CFNRL (VF)CDVb1Vb2VbNFig. 17 Equivalent circuit representation of the multigrain Landau–Khalatnikov model for a ferroelectric HfO2 capacitortrodes, the total charge on the capacitor is calculated asN N(18)QFE = AFE⎛⎝ε0E +1�Pj⎞⎠ ≈AFE�Pj,Fig. 18 Comparison of",1416

Currentwhere AFE is the area of the capacitor plates, ε0 is the vac-response to a triangular voltage signal with a frequency of 10 kHzuum permittivity, N is the total number of grains and Pj isthe polarization of the grain j. It is assumed that all grainshave the same area AFE/N and that each grain has a homoge-neous polarization. While this is an approximation, it seems reasonable since grain sizes in HfO2-based ferroelectrics are (see Sect. 4.2 for details). However, new complications arisetypically in the same order as the film thickness TFE (5–30 nm) [97]. Additionally, grain boundaries generally run from one electrode to the other, perpendicular to the film and nucleation-limited switching kinetics show (see Sect. 4.1) that individual parts of the film switch independent of each other [64]. Therefore, the assumption of modeling nonin-teracting grains electrically in parallel seems justified. Thewhen simulating a FeFET structure due to different boundary conditions compared to a capacitor: When the ferroelectric HfO2 is deposited directly onto the Si channel a SiO2 inter-face forms [64]. Therefore, the potential across each grain will be locally different and a particular spatial distribution of grains will have to be assumed. In case of a regular capac-itor with metal electrodes, the actual spatial position of eachequivalent circuit representation of this model is shown in grain is irrelevant.Fig. 17.

While this example shows the very good agreement of the multigrain LK model with data for rather large capacitors (AFE = 33,000 µm2), it should still result in a more accu-rate representation of HfO2-based ferroelectrics in nanoscale devices. For instance, it should be possible to describe the single-domain switching seen in FeFETs scaled to the 28 nm node [64] more accurately compared to the Preisach model123Additionally, completely new physical phenomena arise when using the LK model compared to other ferroelec-tric models. Based on Landau theory, it was proposed that the region of negative slope of the S-shaped P–E curve (corresponding to a negative capacitance (NC)) could be used to build a FET with subthreshold swing lower than 60 mV/decade at room temperature [99]. Such NCFETs based on Hf1−xZrxO2 have already been demonstrated",280

However, all device simulations reported so far applied a homogeneous single-domain Lan-dau model [101], which cannot accurately predict effects of nonuniformity in HfO2-based ferroelectrics. The device structure of an NCFET is very similar to a regular FeFET, since also a ferroelectric is used in the gate stack, just with different desired parameters (TFE, Pr and EC). Therefore, using an LK-based approach would be beneficial to combine existing models for both memory FeFETs and logic NCFETs into a single comprehensive modeling framework.J Comput Electron (2017) 16:1236–12561251Program opera�on SL / BL (n)SL / BL (n+1)Erase opera�onWL (m)WL (m+1)Fig. 19 Program and erase operation of FeFET cells in AND architec-ture unit cell representation.

These mixed-mode TCAD simu-lations extend the single device model not only by adding different device models but also by combining it with the HSPICE compact models. Based on that it is not hard to con-clude that these simulations are positioned hierarchy-wise between the device simulations and compact models. In the first part of this chapter a mixed-mode simulation of the AND array architecture of FeFET will be reviewed, whereas the second part is devoted to a circuit model of the FeFET.5.1 TCAD simulation of elementary array architecturesWhen looking at semiconductor memories the first step to the circuit level requires array-level simulations. This type of simulation is required in order to verify the functionalitycells must not change their binary state. The VDD/3 scheme in principal allows for a complete voltage drop of VDD across the selected cell whereas the unselected cells only experience one third of this write voltage as parasitic disturb.In order to verify the functionality of such an operational scheme for a specific FeFET device geometry (see Fig. 13 in Sect. 4), TCAD simulation can be utilized. For the given cell array unit cell of Fig. 19, various worst case scenarios have to be considered (see also [103] for a detailed description). The",704
Pesic_Hoffmann_Miko_Uwe_HfO2_domain_theory_JCompEle_2017.docx,results,"of the respective TCAD simulation are shown in Fig. 20.The TCAD simulations where performed such that all worst case disturb scenarios on the respective cells in the AND architecture unit cell representation were analyzed as a function of the so-called inhibit factor αinh. With respect to Fig. 19, the inhibit factor determined the voltages applied to the respective signal lines: Program operation:of each individual memory cell when embedded into a largerVWL(m) = VP VWL(m+1) =αinh· VPVS/BL(n) = αinh · VPVS/BL(n+1) = 0(19)array of multiple cells.

That is,(24)when a cell is selected to be written (i.e., either for program or(25)erase operation), the shared terminals called wordline (WL),bitline (BL) and sourceline (SL) have to be raised or lowered(26)to certain write and inhibit voltages. At the end, the voltageshave to be chosen such that the voltage drop across the gate stack of the selected cell induces a polarization reversal in the ferroelectric film while at the same time all neighboringAccordingly, for the program operation in Fig. 20 on the left-hand side it can be observed that only for an inhibit factor of around 0.7, it is possible to reduce the worst case disturb for1231252J Comput Electron (2017) 16:1236–1256cell (1, 1) appropriately. To be more specific, the worst case for cell (1, 1), when cell (1, 2) shall be programmed into the low-VT state, is present when cell (1, 1) originally resides in a high-VT state. This state can only be maintained when the unselected column n is raised to around 0.7 times the write voltage VP. This verifies that the VDD/3 scheme is indeed best suited for minimizing disturb.The same analysis can be performed for an erase operation oncell(1,2)viatheso-calledPositive–Source–Drain–Erase–Scheme (PSDES) [103]. According to Fig. 20, also there the VDD/3 scheme, i.e., at an inhibit factor of around 0.7, works best for reducing write disturb, in this case erase disturb in particular. Especially with respect to the PSDES scheme it is interesting to note that the high-VT state after the erase operation on cell (1, 2) is not as high as it is for cell (2, 1) which had previously been written into the reference state by a so-called negative gate erase (NGE) operation. This is rooted in the effectiveness of the PSDES and a detailed computational study can be found in [83]. After a in-depth",880

The linear capacitor originates from the consideration of the totalmodel will be discussed next. charge in the ferroelectric.All previously-mentioned models are suitable to repro-5.2 Circuit model of ferroelectric devicesDifferent circuit models were proposed in the literature to model ferroelectric materials in electron devices. Prior to the actual fabrication step of devices they allow the evaluation of designed circuits. Simulation models comprise mathematics-based approaches where the hysteresis loop is reproduced by mathematical functions, switching current models, the parallel elements method as well as physics-based models (see Sect. 3) based on nucleation mechanisms (KAI and NLS model; see Sect. 4.1) or the double-well potential of the Gibbs free energy (Landau–Khalatnikov model; see Sect. 4.3).The mathematical approach includes the Preisach modelduce the hysteretic behavior of the ferroelectric. Switching current models can reproduce transient switching and DC behavior, but the switching current has to be known in the first place or assumptions about its behavior have to be made. The parallel elements method, though the single dipoles can be modeled in a very simple way (e.g., Schmitt trigger), can lead to increasing simulation times because of the numer-ous parallel branches. The same approach accounts for the physics-based models when several domains are modeled. The latter ones are favorable when the priority is given to a behavioral model which emulates the physics of the switch-ing kinetics. Static and dynamic behavior can be described and only a low number of parameters is needed to describe[104–110] already briefly introduced in Sect. 3. Statistically a single dipole.distributed dipoles with individual coercive fields and a spe-cific density function with respect to the coercive fields are superimposed to obtain the overall polarization. If the density function is Gaussian type, the resulting polarization becomes a tanh-function. In the given example, the full hysteresis loopThe Model of the ferroelectric material described in the following (Fig. 21) is based on the approach of Aziz et al. [118] who made use of the LK-equation (Eqs. (16)–(17); Sect. 4.3) to express the voltage drop VFE across the ferro-electric as:is reproduced by two tanh-functions which are shifted alongV T�ρdQPα QPβ Q3γ Q5�(27)the E-axis by ±EC (see Eq. (4) for details). Another mod-eling approach relates to the polarization switching currentFE =FEAFEdt++ FE+ FEof the ferroelectric [111–114]. Here the current is modeledbased on the rate equations of the switching dipoles [114], precalculated polarization current [113] and first-order relax-ation processes [111,112]. On the other side the parallel elements method [115,116] emulates the structure of a ferro-electric material as a parallel circuit of several ferroelectric domains. Single domains are simulated by a Schmitt trig-ger and voltage controlled capacitor and resistor [115,116].123where α, β, γ and ρ are the parameters of the LK-equation introduced in Sect. 4.3. TFE and AFE are the thickness and the area of the ferroelectric, respectively. The first term corresponds to a series resistor with the resistance RN = TFE·ρ/AFE and the following terms reflect the nonlinearity of the ferroelectric capacitor. This nonlinearity (of the ferro-electric) is emulated by a voltage controlled voltage sourceJ Comput Electron (2017) 16:1236–1256 1253(a) ward solution to address this parasitic behavior would be to account this shift by an auxiliary sub-circuit (see Fig. 22a; charge trapping emulation), similar to one reported in [122]. Other implementations like adding a second controlled volt-age source in series are possible. However, since the charge trapping and de-trapping effects occur mainly in the inter-face oxide region and thus depend on the respective electrical fields, the additional circuit should be placed in-between the transistor model and the voltage source modeling the ferro-electric polarization effect.(b)1.2E-5""1""0.0unalignedVds = 0.5V6 Summary and outlook1.0E-5Ids [A]8.0E-6The discovery of ferroelectric properties within HfO2 revived""0""the interest in ferroelectric memories leading to a rapid devel-6.0E-60.10.2opment and impressive device scaling in the last 10 years.

An 80-nm-thick W top electrode with an area of 30×30 μm2, serving as capping for ferroelectricity, was then deposited by sputtering.

Due to the symmetry of the stack, the P–V curve of the MFM structure exhibits a symmetric hysteresis loop of 2Pr = 23 μC/cm2in the wake-up state.. For wake-up, bipolar pulses of 300 cycles under ±6 V/100 Hz were applied.. Unlike the MFM structure, the MFIS structure has an asymmetric hysteresis loop due to the difference in the work functions of top and bottom electrodes [11] and the 1.5-nm-thick IL between the Al:HfO2 film and Si substrate (Fig.. 1(b)), which resulted in an increase in coercive voltage by the voltage drop in the IL..

In particular, the device concept is of great interest for achieving nonvolatile polarity modification in reconfigurable field-effect transistors.. One route to add new functionality to metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) is the integration of switching materials to the transistors.. In this way, memory and computation are merged into a single building block.. [2] Such embedded memory concepts are expected to alleviate the bottleneck between pro-cessor speed and memory access time, with an overall improvement of the computing performances.. A prominent candidate for embedded nonvolatile memory is the fer-roelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET),[3,4] which can operate as a nonvolatile memory cell but also serves to the realization of added functionalities like standard logic opera-tions,[5,6] memory-in-logic,[7] or true random number generators..

KGaA, Weinheimwww.advelectronicmat.deeffects in ferroelectric devices, a pulsed programing and erasing of the device was used to explore the shift of the I–V curve instead of sweeping up to high voltages in both direc-tions. This was done to avoid detrimental effects caused by the slow ramping during the DC I–V curves.[26] The measurements were performed using the terminals sketched in Figure 2a. The top-gate stack covered both the intrinsic Si channel and the metal-semiconductor (NiSi2-Si) Schottky junctions (SJs) and was connected to a pulse measurement unit (PMU). The latter was employed for both recording the transfer character-istics and applying the program (PRG)/erase (ERS) pulses. The source terminal was fixed at ground potential, while the drain terminal was connected to a second PMU. During pulses both source and drain terminals were grounded.Schottky-type SiNW devices based on intrinsic Si are ambi-polar.[27] However, the n-current is comparably small if no optimization is performed[28,29] and falling below the detection limits of the PMU setup. This is the reason why the transfer characteristics of Figure 2c only show p-type currents for the chosen VTG range.The effect of PRG and ERS pulses was evaluated with the simple pulse sequence sketched in Figure 2b. Pulse amplitudes VP=+9 V and VN=−9 V were employed for PRG and ERS, respectively. The pulse duration in both cases was Δ= 4 ms. For reproducibility, the sequence was repeated five times. In Figure 2c, the drain current ID recorded in the programmed (after PRG pulse) and erased (after ERS pulse) state are plotted versus top gate voltage VTG.The transfer curves for the programmed and erased state appear shifted with respect to each other, with a memory window MW≈1 V. In particular, the shift is in the positive (negative) voltage direction for the transfer curve recorded after the ERS (PRG) pulse. This is coherent to what has been reported for p-type FeFETs in ref. [30] and in general is expected for FeFETs. In contrast to charge trapping that shifts the transfer curve always in the direction of voltage pulse, for ferroelectric gate oxide the transfer curve shifts always to the opposite direction.[26,31] We propose a qualitative interpreta-tion based on the band diagrams sketched in Figure 2e, for the transistor in the on-state. A voltage pulse generates a polarization PFE within the ferroelectric HZO layer due to alignment of the internal dipoles, which remains after the pulse. This polarization directly above the Si channel acts as an additional electric field EFE. A PRG pulse (positive)",687
Sessi_Weber_Weber_FE_NW_FET_AEM_2020.docx,results,"in an additional positive EFE, i.e., for a p-type FET the device at zero applied external voltage is more “off” compared to the case without PFE. As a consequence, similar to what is reported for MOSFET-type FeFETs, the transfer characteristics after a PRG pulse is shifted toward more negative voltages by EFE. The behavior reverses for the ERS pulse, i.e., EFE is nega-tive and therefore the FET appears more “on” at zero applied external voltage.An additional effect of EFE which is not observed in MOSFET-type FeFETs is evidenced in the linear plot of Figure 2d, where the average ID is plotted versus overdrive voltage. The latter is calculated as the difference between the applied voltage and the threshold voltage V*TH. Here, V*TH is defined as the VTG at which ID=I*TH= 10−8 A. When comparing the transfer characteristics after PRG and ERS pulses in Figure 2d, a slightly different IDfor the same overdrive is found. In particular, an almost con-stant relative current variation between ERS and PRG states ΔID ON= (IDERS−ID PR)/ID ERS≈30% is observed in the overdrive range below ≈−1.2 V, approximately corresponding to the tran-sistor on-state. This is not the case for MOSFET-type p-FeFET[30] and n-FeFET[9] devices, where the transfer characteristics after PRG and ERS pulses are only “horizontally” shifted. This effect may be attributed to the particular carrier injection mechanism in Schottky-barrier FETs (SB-FETs) that involves thermal emis-sion but also tunneling, with the latter being dominant in the transistor’s ON state.[28] The band-bending due to EFE described above in the specific case also modifies the SB width at the source and drain contacts. In particular, the SB width for hole injection (i.e., into the valence band Ev) is enlarged by a posi-tive EFE (programmed state, Figure 2e, left) and reduced by a negative EFE (erased state, Figure 2e, right). Consequently, the junction transmissibility via tunneling is reduced or enhanced, respectively. As for SB-FETs the tunneling current is the domi-nant contribution to the on-current, the latter is very sensitive to modifications of the potential landscape around the SJs. In ON of ≈30% could be due to spatial particular, the reported ΔID inhomogeneity of EFE, i.e., stronger EFE in proximity of the SJs, resulting in a sizeable modification of the tunneling barrier. A spatial inhomogeneity of EFE could have electrostatic reasons, in connection to the intrinsic character of the SiNW channel. This interpretation is coherent to what has been reported in ref. [22], where a strong on-current difference between PRG and ERS states was achieved by a remanent EFE localized at one single SJ (at the source contact). Note that when an SB-FET is used, the additional modulation of the SB width increases the memory window compared to the one that can be observed in a classical MOSFET. Therefore, SB-FETS can be beneficial to realize FeFET memory cells.We have further characterized the SiNW-FeFET by varying the pulse intensity (VP and VN), duration (Δt), and wait time (WT) between pulse and read, according to the sequences in Figure 3a,b. The",792
Sessi_Weber_Weber_FE_NW_FET_AEM_2020.docx,results,"are displayed in Figure 3c,e for the PRG pulse, and in Figure 3d,f for the ERS pulse. In order to preset the devices always to the same reference state, the PRG (ERS) pulse sequence was preceded by a PRG-ERS (ERS-PRG) reset series, as in Figure 3a,b. For both PRG and ERS pulses, voltage pulse amplitudes above 6 V are required to achieve a detectable shift of the transfer characteristics. These large values result from a relatively thick SiO2 layer in the gate-stack. In fact, due to its significantly lower dielectric con-stant and to a comparable physical thickness with respect to the ferroelectric layer, the resulting capacitive voltage divider in the gate-stack is such that a large portion of the gate voltage drops over the SiO2 layer. Nevertheless, to increase the switching efficiency, it is desirable to increase the voltage drop over the HZO layer. This can be achieved by reducing the SiO2 thickness and/or increasing the HZO thickness. In fact, as recently demonstrated for planar FeFETs with 20 nm thick HfO2, this not only enhances the switching efficiency but also increases the memory window and the resilience against parasitic charge trapping.[32] Charge trapping is in fact known to affect HfO2-based ferroelectric devices[26] and we expect it to influence also the memory window in our SiNW-FeFET device.Adv.

Here, the extracted V*TH values at I*TH= 10−8 A are plotted versus VP (VN), for several Δt values. The gradual increase is compatible to the channel length of 1 µm, encompassing the presence of a large number of ferroelectric domains.[15] Moreover, due to the under-etching, the thickness of the HZO is slightly inhomogenous as seen in the TEM cross-section of Figure 1h, resulting in local variations of the switching voltage.The effect of Δt within the investigated range is less pro-nounced compared to what is expected in FeFETs.[15] For long times and small voltages, an opposite shift in threshold voltage is seen, which can be explained by parasitic charge trapping effects in the gate stack.In Figure4, we evaluated the retention of the programmed/ erased states by recording MW as a function of the wait time WT between pulse and read. The memory window drops down composing the gate-stack employed here, leading to strong depolarization fields which negatively affect the retention.[30,33] The depolarization arises from a nonperfect screening of the polarization charges leading to a residual electric field which counteracts the ferroelectric polarization.[33] Furthermore, com-pared to an MOS device with ferroelectric gate, the cross-sec-tion of the channel region of SiNWs has multiple Si/SiO2 ori-entations leading, e.g., to locally different interface trap charge (Qit) and possibly oxide fixed charge (Qf) density levels within the same device.[34–36] These",964

The HZO films were deposited by 100 supercycles of alternating TEMAHf and TEMAZr-based processes with a cycle ratio of 1:1. The deposition temperature was 250 °C.The metal-gate stack for the SiNW FeFETs was fabricated by e-beam lithography, deposition of Ti/Pt (10 nm/20 nm) by an e-beam evaporator, and lift-off. The sample was then immersed in HF with concentration 2.5%, for 7 min in order to form openings through the HZO for the source and drain contacts. The different HF etching rate for the metals composing the gate stack (low for Pt, high for Ti[40]) resulted in a selective under-etching of the Ti layer and thinning of the HZO layer underneath. The element-specific TEM in Figure 1i confirmed that no substantial Ti was present in the gate stack. From local energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of the HZO layer, the atomic ratio of Hf to Zr was found to be 38:62 (see the Supporting Information). The discrepancy with the expected 50:50 ratio could be Figure4. Memory window MW versus wait time WT, the time interval between pulse and measurement.

Two distinct transistor states (programmed and erased) were observed in correspond-ence to negative and positive polarization in the ferroelec-tric layer, with a memory window of ≈1.5 V. As the top gate also covers the SJs between intrinsic Si and NiSi2 segments, associated with the ferroelectric polarization, also a non-volatile modulation of the SJ transmissibility was observed, with a relative current variation ΔID ON∼ 30%. Consequently, the memory window is increased in the SiNW Schottky-FET compared to a conventional FeFET because of the additional effect of the modulation of the tunneling barrier transmis-sibility of charge carriers. The reported proof of principle of a attributed to a slightly higher etching rate of diluted HF for HfO2 with respect to ZrO2.[41] The polarization versus voltage curves of metal-insulator-metal structures fabricated using the same ALD process as for the SiNW FeFETs are reported in the Supporting Information, for the as-deposited (25 nm) as well as for a 5 nm thick HZO film.

Here the superlattices were grown at growth temperatures of 510 °C and 460 °C; details of the sputtering process and growth conditions can be found in Ref. [7]. At room temperature, bulk STO is an insulating cubic perovskite with lattice parameter a = 3.905 Å[11]and its energy remains minimum for zero polarization at all temperatures. This para-electric material, however, is easily polarizable and a sponta-neous polarization can be induced at room temperature under strain.[12]PTO on the other hand is one of the most studied fer-roelectric materials. Its paraelectric phase is also cubic perov-skite, with lattice parameter a = 3.969 Å at the bulk transition temperature.[13]This phase is only stable above ∼ 750 K and, at room temperature, bulk PTO has a tetragonal ferroelectric structure with a = 3.904 Å and c = 4.152 Å. As can be ex-pected from the lattice parameters of the two systems and in agreement with theoretical phase diagrams,[14]when grown on STO, the compressive misfit strain (um = (asubstrate – a0)/ asubstrate where asubstrate is the in-plane lattice parameter of the substrate and a0 is the equivalent cubic cell lattice constant of the free standing film) forces PTO to grow c-axis oriented with its polarization along the growth direction.

Here we have based our work on an expansion of the Hel-moltz free energy in terms of polarization and strain[18]and have converted the parameters of PTO accordingly.[19]The cu-bic lattice parameter of PTO is taken to be 3.969 Å and that of STO 3.905 Å, giving a misfit strain of um PTO = -0.0164 for PTO on STO and trivially for STO on STO um STO = 0. We do not consider evolution of this misfit strain with temperature. Indeed",325

The 9/0 superlattice is essentially a PTO thin film, grown in 9 unit cell steps to ensure that the reduction of leak-age was not in fact simply a result of growing the samples in steps. It seems that the insertion of 2 or more unit cells of STO reduces the leakage dramatically and that it no longer in-terferes with the polarization measurement. One feature of these loops is that the coercive field is very high and also quite asymmetric. We have found that this is due to an interfacial capacitance that arises at the Nb-doped STO/superlattice in-terface. Superlattices grown on SrRuO3 electrodes show much smaller coercive fields, but the essence of the",267

This is because the cur-rent measured contains components due to switching of the ferroelectric polarization, from the linear dielectric response of the material, and, where it exists, a component from leak-age current. In order to separate out only the stable ferroelec-tric polarization a PUND (Positive Up Negative Down)6xaPTO� 2 xaPTO�111P4 � 4 xaPTO��� 1 � x��aSTO� 1 � x�� 0�aSTO��P2�6�measurement[20]was used.

Then a four pulse train isTo test to which extent the spontaneous polarization can be tuned and how well this can be predicted from the theoretical model, the electrical properties of a number of superlattices were measured as a function of the PTO volume fraction.

It is apparent that this anom-alous increase of tetragonality occurs in films grown at both temperatures, though to a much greater extent in films grown at 460 °C. In Ref. [7], due to the lack of electrical measure-ments, it was not definitely established if this increase was a real recovery of ferroelectricity or, instead, a consequence of a modification of the value of cij or gij in ultrathin layers; Figure 2 definitely confirms the existence of a spontaneous polarization and the survival of a strain-polarization coupling qualitatively similar to that observed for higher values of x into the unusual regime.While it is straightforward and relatively fast to measure the room temperature tetragonality and compare it to the fer-roelectric polarization, additional insight can be gained byphase transition of the superlattice at any composition will be second-order and the phase transition temperature can be obtained as that for which the quadratic coefficient in the E expansion the compressive epitaxial strain imposed to the STO layer is�xaPTO�3� 1 � x�aSTO�vanishes.

Indeed the recov-ery of ferroelectricity at low volume fractions[7]is here ob-served in all 3 measurements indicating that even when sim-ple electrostatic models break down the relationship between these quantities is at least qualitatively preserved even in this regime.. Secondly, it is demonstrated that a simple Landau the-ory approach involving only bulk parameters is rather predic-tive in superlattices with x > 0.4 and thus could aid greatly in the design of tailored ferroelectric superlattices for specific applications.. This is especially appealing as a large body of work characterizing nearly all known ferroelectrics in their bulk forms on the basis of Landau theory exists, so that our present approach can be readily generalized for a large num-ber of systems.. Although there is currently a great deal of in-terest in enhancing polarization and transition temperatures of ferroelectric materials to higher values through strain engi-neering,[13,26]for many applications this is not actually what is required.. For example, ferroelectric field effect devices[27,28] require a particular polarization value that matches the prop-erties of the material to which the induced charge effect is applied (which is frequently much lower than the values ob-tained in typical perovskite ferroelectrics)..

chen_SiGE_HZO_VLSI_2018.docx,Introduction,"The development of HfO2-based ferroelectric (FE) has ushered in a new era for green memory and logic devices which encompass two basic structures, metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) typically for memory applications such as FeRAM [1] or ferroelectric tunneling junction (FTJ) [2] and metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor (MFS) mainly for steep-slope negative capacitance logic devices [3] and memory-based FeFETs [4]. Besides performance, it is imperative to study the reliability performance before devices can be practically used. The reliability issues have been well explored and possible solutions were proposed for MFM structures [5]. For MFS structures, although the semiconductor material has been evolved from Si to Ge substrate [6], similar studies on Ge are in the very early stage [7, 8] and the impact of introducing Ge into Si substrate on reliability characteristics has never been reported. In this work, by using epitaxial SiGe on Si substrate with various Ge content as the platform, with MFS structure, the dependence of reliability characteristics of ferroelectric HZO on Ge content ranging from 16 % to 44 % was investigated. The importance of this work lies in two aspects. (a) Bridging the understanding gap between FE-HZO on Si and Ge substrate and (b) Pioneering the in-depth FE-HZO investigation on epitaxial SiGe film, which is the most promising successor to Si for sub-7 nm VLSI technology before Ge process matures.

Device Fabrication 15-nm epitaxial SiGe film with Ge content of 16 % and 44 % grown on Si substrate was adopted as the platform. After doping the SiGe by P (21019 cm-3), HZO dielectric of 10 nm was formed followed by 30-nm TiN electrode deposition, both by ALD, to form the MFS structure. Then 30-sec RTA at 500 oC was used to crystallize HZO for inducing ferroelectricity. The same substrate doping and MFS structure was also prepared on Si substrate as reference. Besides electrical measurement to confirm the ferroelectricity, extensive reliability characteristics including endurance, retention and imprint effects were studied for different samples.

Ge content-dependent reliability performance Fig. 4 shows the dependence of cycling on P-V curves for devices on Si0.56Ge0.44 by ±4 V/100k Hz bipolar stress. Fig. 5 displays the endurance performance under the same stress but with different frequencies for all kinds of samples. Abrupt leakage increase indicates generation of a large amount of defects that completely pin domain walls. For Si, although reliability improves as stress frequency increases from 1k to 100k Hz, significant wake-up and fatigue effects are still observed. However, devices on Si0.56Ge0.44 are almost free from the issues up to 109 cycles (100k Hz).Fig. 6 shows the Arrhenius plot of wake-up for activation energy (Ea) extraction [9]. Ea for Si is 0.58 eV, which is close to the oxygen vacancy (Vo) migration energy near Si/HfO2 interfaces [10]. Si0.56Ge0.44 with higher Ea of 1.17 eV implies fewer Vo at interface. Fig. 7 shows the retention of PSW, OS (Switched Polarization, Opposite State) for all samples under pristine state at 25/85 oC. Severer retention degradation is found at 85 oC for Si due to imprint effect, which is inferred by the significant OS read current peak shift (inset). The degradation is greatly mitigated for Si0.56Ge0.44 with stable PSW, OS up to 104 sec at 25 oC. However, PSW, SS (Same State) is independent of substrate/temperature (Fig. 8).

The imprint effect is alleviated by using Si0.56Ge0.44. As the Ge content in the substrate increases, HZO reliability improves accordingly. It indicates that HZO/substrate interface plays the essential role. (C). Origin of superior reliability for higher Ge content The fatigue effect during cycling is due to newly generated defects and injected charges that pin the domain walls. Retention loss is resulted from leakage followed by charge trapping while imprint effect is caused by internal E-field due to trapped charge. The reliability improvement by increasing Ge content can be explained by the thinner sub-oxide interfacial layer (IL) with better quality between HZO/substrate that helps suppress trapping/generation of charges. The inference is evidenced by the XPS Ge 2p and Si 2p spectra (Fig. 11). For Ge 2p spectra, the peak at 1220.5 eV corresponds to Ge-O bond in the form of GeOx (x=1.5~2). However, the GeOx:Ge peak intensity ratio is rather weak and independent of Ge content, indicating less GeOx. It is caused by interdiffusion between ZrO2 in HZO and GeOx, consistent with the result that ZrO2/Ge tends to form nearly zero GeOx IL after 500 oC annealing [11]. Interdiffusion means Ge incorporation into HZO which is helpful to form o-phase [11] as seen in XRD and explains a larger Pr due to Zr-Ge bond at interface [6]. For Si 2p spectra, compared to Si, SiOx component on Si0.56Ge0.44 is also found but with much weaker intensity and stronger oxide quality (BE closer to higher oxidation state Si4+ implies more stoichiometric bonding with fewer Vo, consistent with the larger Ea of Si0.56Ge0.44). EDS line scan also proves Zr-Ge bond for Si0.56Ge0.44 due to incorporation of Ge at HZO/IL interface (Fig. 12). The thinner IL is confirmed by the inset TEM. IL in MFS is critical for reliability [12]. Better reliability for Si0.56Ge0.44 is due to its IL that is too thin to trap charges and of stronger bonding to suppress defects generation. Smaller E-field across the IL (higher κ with GeOx) also explains the better reliability.",551

In addition, suffi-ciently small grain size is required to prevent the formation of the stable monoclinic phase (m-phase, space group: P21/c). The small grain size is accompanied with the high surface to volume ratio, and the smaller surface energy of the tetrago-nal phase (t-phase, space group: P42/nmc) induced the for-mation of t-phase when the nuclei size is smaller than the critical value (�26 nm for Hf0.5Zr0.5O2). During the initial stage of film growth, nuclei of t-phase were formed on the bottom electrode layer and they transformed into the o-phase at the moment of zipping occurs, which is accompanied with the asymmetric strain that was necessary to induce the un-usual phase transition.16 The feasible ferroelectricity (Pr > 20 lC/cm2) with extremely small tf (<10 nm) is considered highly promising for various applications. In contrast, such a small tf can be a critical barrier for exploring the physics behind the unex-pected FE phenomenon, including domain dynamics and structural analysis. However, it was already reported that the ferroelectricity of HZO thin films is significantly degraded when the thickness of the thin films increases over 20 nm,18 which was also observed in Si-doped HfO2 films.19The rea-son for the degradation is that the FE o-phase transforms into non-FE m-phase with the increasing film thickness which must be accompanied with the grain growth (increase in grain size) for polycrystalline HfO2-based FE thin films.20,21 Thus, it is highly required to suppress the formation of the m-phase by independently controlling the grain size of HZO films to achieve the feasible ferroelectricity in films thickerthese materials originates from the formation of non-than 20 nm.centrosymmetric Pca21 (Pbc21 in some",649

Therefore, the electrical role of Al2O3 in the HZAHZ stacked film is a series resistor, which increases the apparent Ec.29 One of the problems in the electrical performances of the HZO films is their exceptionally high Ec (�1 MV/cm) which is higher than that of conventional FE materials by almost one order of magnitude. This requires application electric field with a magnitude of several MV/cm to observe fully saturated P-E hysteresis loops, which is generally too severe to safely measure the reliability the HZO FE films, such as fatigue resistance. In fact, the authors reported a fa-tigue test",294

Both HZO and HZAHZ samples could endure up to �106cycles with the pulse height of 2.5 MV/cm and frequency of 100 kHz. However, the Pr of HZAHZ films further decreased with increasing number of field cycling compared to that of HZO films. It is believed that Al2O3 interlayer can make charge trap sites in HZO layer, which degraded the endurance of HZAHZ films. (See the supplementary material.) However, the 106cycle of field cycling might not be an intrinsic endurance limitation of HZAHZ capacitor, which could be improved by optimiz-ing fabrication process. Therefore, suppressing the leakage current is another critical issue for the HZO film for both the property estimation and stable operation of the integrated FElayer on RL and Ci could be examined by comparing those of devices.10 nm-thick HZO and 20 nm-thick HZAHZ films. From the analysis, calculated RL of 20 nm-thick HZAHZ film was larger than that of 10 nm-thick HZO film by �18 X, which is similar to the resistance of 1 nm-thick Al2O3 film in the pre-vious report (�15 X).29However, Ci values of 10 nm-thick HZO film and 20 nm-thick HZAHZ film are �33 nF and�32 nF, respectively. Since these values are much larger than the theoretical capacitance of 1 nm-thick Al2O3 (�8 nF with er of 9), the Al2O3 layer did not work as a series capaci-tor. Thus, these",402

The thinness of the Al2O3 layer allows fluent carrier transport across the layer, which does not interfere with the polarization of the HZAHZ film across the entire film thickness. If the Al2O3 layer played role as an insulatingFigures 4(a) and 4(b) show the J–E curves of the HZO and HZAHZ films with the various tf values. While the J level of the thicker (>30 nm) HZO films were low enough up to 2 MV/cm for both bias polarities that of the thinner HZO film was largely degraded due to the involvement of possible defects and surface roughness. However, for the HZAHZ films, the J level is highly low with almost no change with the film thickness. It is notable that the J level of 20 nm-thick HZAHZ film is lower than that of single layer HZO layer with the identical thickness by several orders of magnitude over wide field region. As aforementioned, this is not due to the insulating property of the thin Al2O3 layer since it plays a role as the series resistor via the probable involvement of tunneling mechanism.

CSHwang_Grain_Size_Engineering_HZO_APL_2015.docx,conclusion,", the problem of degrading ferroelectric performance of the HZO films with increasing tf, which could be ascribed to the increased portion of non- ferroelectric m-phase at higher tf could be resolved by inter-posing the Al2O3 interlayer at the middle position of HZO film.. The Al2O3 interlayer interrupted the continuous grain growth HZO film, which was accompanied with the decrease in the average grain size.. Therefore, the higher portion of ferroelectric o-phase could be retained up to the film thick-ness of 40 nm.. The two portions of the HZO films at upper and lower position appear to have identical ferroelectric per-formances even though the lower portion was grown on TiN BE, while the upper portion was grown on the inserted thin Al2O3 layer.. This implies that the repetition of even higher number of stacking might be possible without degrading the ferroelectric performance, which is under investigation.. The insertion of thin Al2O3 layer was also highly effective to largely decrease the leakage current, which will greatly facil-itate the stable operation of integrated device as well as the precise evaluation of the reliability of this ferroelectric layer..

Kioxia_Reevaluation_FEFET_VLSI_2020.docx,Abstract,"—We re-examine the dominant factors of the memory window (MW) and reliability of HfO2 FeFET using a new technique to extract both spontaneous polarization (Ps) and interface trap charges (Qt) by one-time current measurement of an FeFET during the memory operation. FeFET characteristics are strongly affected by unstable Qt (unrelated to ferroelectric) which causes Vth instability just after programming, and stable Qt which compensates most of electric(E)-field generated by Ps. Stable Qt is coupled to Ps with constant ratio (~90%), and reduce MW to the value much lower than the coercive voltage (Vc) limitation. Unlike the conventional model, Ps increase and stabilization are still effective to improve MW and retention, respectively. During cycling, MW is degraded by ∆Ps reduction as well as the increase of the compensation ratio (∆Qt/∆Ps) which can be mitigated by suppressing charge injection/ejection via interfacialSiO2.",206
Kioxia_Reevaluation_FEFET_VLSI_2020.docx,Introduction,": HfO2 FeFET has attracted much attention as a promising emerging memory because of its high speed/low voltage operation and CMOS compatibility. Recently, a huge amount of Qt at the interface close to 1014 cm-2 in FeFET has been reported [1, 2]. Although it has been suggested that the charge trapping affects Vth instability after programing (prog.) [2, 3], retention [3, 4], and the limited endurance [3, 5], the accurate amount of ∆Ps as well as ∆Qt during memory operation and their impact on the MW and reliability have not been understood yet. In this study, we extract both ∆Ps and ∆Qt directly from FeFET under various operating conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, we re-examine the dominant factors of the memory characteristics and reconstruct the improvement guideline.",181
Kioxia_Reevaluation_FEFET_VLSI_2020.docx,discussion,"s: We measured poly-Si channel thin-film transistor with Si-doped ferroelectric (FE)-HfO2 of 10nm. Cross sectional TEMis shown in Fig. 1. The thickness of interfacial SiO2 is around 1.5nm. We newly developed a convenient analysis scheme that can extract both ∆Ps and ∆Qt during prog., retention and cycling from one-time current measurement of a single FeFET (no need for Hall measurement unlike [1]). Fig. 2 shows the concept of the analysis and the measurement sequence. Vth shift after erase (Vg<0) /prog. (Vg>0) operation is shown in Fig. 3. Vth just after prog. shifts to the positive direction which is opposite to the expected direction, then Vth decreases drastically in about 10sec. After 1000sec, Vth increases again. The change of Ps and Qt caused by prog. and the subsequent time evolution derived from (1)-(4) (Fig. 2a) are shown in Fig. 4a. Qt larger than Ps is generated temporarily, but a part of Qt disappears within 10sec (I). After that, the state is stable until 1000sec, then Ps and Qt start to decrease together (II). From these characteristics, the charges produced by prog. can be divided into the unstable component which disappears in 10sec and the stable component which does not change until 1000sec as shown in Fig. 4b. These components are also clearly separated in the erase operation (Fig. 4c). Unstable charge trapping:As shown in Fig. 4b, the unstable component is dominated by Qt. The positive Vth shift caused by prog. and the following Vth reduction with time are also observed in FETs with paraelectric-HfO2/SiO2 as shown in Fig. 5. So, the unstable Qt (electron trapping: e--trapping) originates in the defects unrelated to FE. In an FeFET, the E-field modulation due to the excessive e--trapping induces a small amount of the unstable Ps. Stable charge compensation of Ps at the interface: In the stable component, Qt is quite large and close to Ps as shown in Fig. 4b. The correlation of Qt with Ps extracted by changing the prog. condition (Fig. 6a) is shown in Fig. 6b. ∆Qt is almost 90% of ∆Ps regardless of the prog. condition. This proves that the stable Qt completely follows the Ps and inevitably compensates the most of 978-1-7281-6460-1/20/$31.00 ©2020 IEEEPs. As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the following feedback would occur: Ps increases the E-field across SiO2 and causes e--injection, and consequently charge compensation at the interface decreases the E-field across SiO2, then high E-field across HfO2 is maintained even at large Ps. Fig. 7 shows the dependence of MW on Ps. Although the large Ps (> 10uC/cm2) is realized, only 10% of Ps contributes to MW because of the charge compensation. As a result, MW is proportional to Ps for a wide range. So, Ps increase still directly contributes to MW enlargement. This is significantly different from the conventional FeFET model (ideal situation) where Vc is the indicator of MW for such a large Ps. Impact of each component on Reliability: Correlation of Qt and Ps is maintained even in the long-term retention (Fig. 8). Despite the E-field across SiO2 should accelerate e--injection via SiO2, Qt decreases with Ps reduction which is possibly caused by the depolarization field of FE-HfO2 as shown in Fig. 9. This means that the Vth shift in long-term domain is triggered by Ps change, not by charge injection. This is also different from the conventional model. To improve the retention, Ps stabilization is essential. Fig. 10 shows the cycling characteristics. MW starts to reduce after 1k cycles (Fig. 10a). One of the origins for MW reduction is ∆Ps decrease (Fig. 10b). ∆Qt also decreases with ∆Ps but the ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio increases with cycling then reaches almost unity (Fig. 10b). ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio increase is critical, because ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio of unity vanishes MW even if the decrease of ∆Ps can be suppressed. To verify the possibility that the increase of ∆Qt/∆Ps originates in the stabilization of e--trapping unrelated to FE, Ig-Vg during erase at each cycle are compared in Fig. 11a. The peaks belonging to the e--trapping unrelated to FE disappear within 100sec even after the cycling. So, the larger ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio after cycling is not caused by the stabilization of the e--trapping unrelated to FE. As shown in Fig. 11b, ∆Qt is also proportional to ∆Ps even after 100k cycles. From these",1098
Kioxia_Reevaluation_FEFET_VLSI_2020.docx,results,", it is suggested that the trap sites which can compensate Ps stably increase with cycling as shown in Fig. 11c. The excessive prog. stress which causes a larger amount of the unstable e--trapping (Fig. 12a) accelerates ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio increase, while the unipolar stress does not cause the degradation as shown in Fig. 12b. This means that the repetition of e--trapping/de-trapping via SiO2 caused by the unstable components induces the additional trap sites at the interface which can compensate Ps and indirectly affects ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio of the stable component. The charge trapping/de-trapping caused by the stable component itself presumably has more impact on ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio increase by cycling, because ∆Qt of the stable component is much larger than the unstable component as shown in Fig. 4b. Revised model and guideline: Dominant factors of the memory characteristics are summarized in Fig. 13a. Compared to the conventional model assuming the ideal situation and additional charge trapping, a huge amount of Qt completely coupled to Ps strongly dominate the whole memory operation in the revised model as shown in Fig. 13b. Based on this model, we developed the improvement guideline: Ps increase/stabilization, and suppression of charge injection/ejection via SiO2, all of which are supported by the",294
Kioxia_Reevaluation_FEFET_VLSI_2020.docx,Conclusion,"s: Behaviors of both Ps and Qt during FeFET memory operation were quantitatively revealed by the newly developed analysis. A huge amount of stable interface trap charges coupled to Ps significantly alters the operating model of FeFET memory. Ps increase and stabilization are still effective for MW and retention improvement, respectively.

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4960461]HfO2-based thin films have been widely investigated for use as high-k gate dielectrics in Si-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor devices because of their good compatibility with Si technology and superior properties compared with conventional SiO2 gate dielectrics, such as their higher relative permittivity.1,2Moreover, HfO2 thin films can be prepared by chemical vapor deposition, includ-ing atomic layer deposition, which is suitable for the minute-ness of semiconductor devices.1–4 In 2011, B€oscke and M€uller et al. discovered ferroelec-tricity in HfO2-based thin films.5,6Their studies showed that this ferroelectricity originates from a metastable non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase (Pca21) in some HfO2-based thin films.5,7–9Notable features of ferroelectricity in HfO2-based thin films are their good stability against forming-gas treatment and appearance of ferroelectricity down to 2.5 nm in thickness; both these properties are not found in conventionally used ferroelectric films, such as tetragonal Pb(Zr, Ti)O3 and SrBiTa2O9.10–13These features open the door for the realization of devices that are scaled down to nanometer-size using ferroelectric thin films, such as ferroelectric tunnel junctions and piezoelectric transistors, which are very difficult to realize using conventional ferro-To realize scaled-down ferroelectric devices using ferro-electric HfO2 films on Si substrates, orientation control of fer-roelectric films is a critical issue because film’s ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties strongly depend on its orienta-tion.14,15For example, {100}-oriented films, i.e., films with mixed orientations of (100), (010), and (001), require precise control over the volume fraction of (001) orientation to control the ferroelectricity because of the spontaneous polarization of orthorhombic HfO2 phase along the c-axis; i.e., (001)-oriented films have the largest ferroelectricity, while (100)- and (010)-oriented ones have no ferroelectricity.Previous studies demonstrate the epitaxial growth of an orthorhombic 0.07YO1.5-0.93HfO2 (YHO7) film on (100) yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and 10 wt. % Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO)-covered (100) YSZ substrates by direct deposi-tion of the crystallized thin films at high temperature.7,16 However, phase formation via annealing after deposition at low temperature, ideally room temperature, would be more beneficial because it could be applied for various deposition techniques including the practically used atomic layer depo-sition as well as for chemical solution deposition, which allows the optimization of ferroelectric properties by allow-ing a more complicate composition.

The substrate temperature and atmosphere were maintained at room temperature and 10 mTorr O2, respectively. (111)-oriented epitaxial and uniaxial textured ITO layers, which were deposited on (111)YSZ and (111)Pt/ TiOx/SiO2/(001)Si by PLD, were used as underlying layers for the growth of (111)-oriented epitaxial and uniaxial textured films. The thicknesses of the ITO, Pt, TiOx, and SiO2 layers were 28 nm, 110 nm, 30 nm, and 100 nm, respectively. In the literature, orientation-controlled YHO7 films were directly grown at 700�C on these substrate materials by PLD from the vapor phase.16However, here we deposited the films at room temperature and we then annealed them by rapid thermal annealing in a furnace at 1000�C for 10 s under N2 flow (the heating rate was 25�C/s and the cooling rate was �8�C/s). Film thicknesses were ascertained by X-ray reflection measurements (X’Pert-MRD, Philips). Meanwhile, the crystal structures of these films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) h–2h and reciprocal space mapping using a laboratory machine (X’Pert-MRD, Philips and D8 DISCOVER, Bruker) and synchrotron facilities (SPring8, BL15).

Owing to their various superior proper-ties,18–21)such as large band gap (>5 eV), high breakdown electric field, low leakage current, and good oxide reliability, lanthanum oxide (La2O3) and La-based oxides are amongthemostpromisinghigh-�dielectricsforthefuturetechnology nodes. However, unlike SiO2, which is an almost ideal insulator, high-� dielectrics usually contain plenty of bulk traps and interface states, especially after electrical stress. These nonideal defects cause instability of devices during operation,22–24)which leads to the distortion of analog functions performed by the MIM capacitor and further limits the performance of RF/analog circuits. As a result, from the viewpoint of practical use, the electrical-stress-induced degradation of high-� MIM capacitors is a serious concern. Some studies25,26)have discussed the capacitance variation of SiO2 MIM capacitors under electrical stress. However, the degradation of a high-� MIM capacitor under electrical stress has not been well characterized.

The schematic layout and cross section of the capacitor along the A–A0cutline in the layout are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. The high-�La2O3 film was deposited by electron beam evaporation and annealed in O2 ambient to improve its quality. The bilayer top (TaN/Ni) and bottom (TaN/Ta) electrodes were depos-ited by reactive sputtering. The Ta and TaN layers were used to reduce the parasitic resistance and to serve as a diffusion barrier layer, respectively. All the process temperatures during MIM capacitor fabrication were below 400�C, compatible with the backend process. The samples were then subjected to CVS in the range of �4:2 to �5 V. Afterwards, the capacitance–voltage (C–V) curves were measured at 25�C using an LCR meter at various stress time intervals, and the dielectric loss (D) was also observed simultaneously. All the electrical measurements were carried out by applying a voltage to the top electrode while the bottom electrode was grounded.04DB16-1 # 2010 The Japan Society of Applied PhysicsJpn. J. Appl.

The capacitance density at zero bias is about 11.4 fF/mm2, and the leakage current densities at �1:5 and +1.5 V are 16 and 56 nA/cm2, respectively. The leakage current density is satisfactory because the operating voltage of the RF/analog MIM capacitor is smaller than 1.5 V for the sub-65 nm technology node.15)The quadratic voltage coefficient of capacitance (�), used to depict the voltage dispersion or voltage dependency of capacitance, is obtained from fitting the C–V curves by the second-order polynomial equation:CðVÞ ¼ C0 � ð� � V2þ � � V þ 1Þ; ð1Þ where C0 is the capacitance at zero bias. The � values of the 10-nm La2O3 MIM capacitor measured at 10 and 100 kHz are 775 and 671 ppm/V2, respectively. The positive �represents a capacitance density rise with the increase in applied voltage, which may be attributed to the high degree of electric field polarization and carrier injection.4,9,10) During the voltage sweeping, some of the injected carriers would be captured by the interface trap states existing in the dielectric near the injection electrode. These trapped charges could induce dipoles following the alternating signals with a dipole relaxation time. Moreover, the other injection carriers become excess mobile charges in the insulator, and these mobile charges also follow the small ac signals with a free carrier relaxation time that depends on the mobility and density of carriers. The dipole and free carrier relaxation time contribute to various frequency-dependent character-istics in RF/analog MIM capacitors. As the measurement frequency increases, the trapped-charge-induced dipoles and the excess mobile charges hardly follow the ac signal, corresponding to the longer relaxation times of these dipoles and mobile charges. Thus, the capacitance fluctuation due tothe electrode and the dielectric leads to the better capaci-tance stability of MIM capacitors under CVS. The higher barrier height at the metal/insulator interface reduces carrier injection and therefore",500

The top injection under negative voltage stress is chosen because of the higher work function of Ni (�5 eV) than that of TaN (�4:5 eV). Figure 3 shows the relative capacitance variation ½�C=Cðt ¼ 0Þ� as a function of stress time at various CVS voltages from �4:6 to �5 V. The relative capacitance variation is defined asCðt ¼ 0Þ ¼ C0ðtÞ � C0ðt ¼ 0Þ ; ð2Þwhere C0ðt ¼ 0Þ is the initial capacitance at zero bias before stress, and t is the stress time. ½�C=Cðt ¼ 0Þ� increases with the CVS voltage and the stress time. On the other hand, ½�C=Cðt ¼ 0Þ� is also plotted as a function of the injected charge (Qinj) in the inset of Fig. 3. The relative capacitance variation increases with a logarithmic increase in Qinj regardless of the stress biases, which implies that the increasing charge trapping in dielectrics during CVS is responsible for the capacitance variation.27)The trapped charges in the preexisting traps and in stress-induced traps generate dipoles to increase the local permittivity and the capacitance. Among them, the stress-induced dipoles con-tribute to the relative increase in capacitance with respect to its initial condition, and that is the degradation of the capacitance.25,26)Specifically, the relative capacitance var-iation is proportional to the amount of stress-induced trapped charges.

Yen_MHLee_10_16_endurance_VLSI_2015.docx,Introduction,"The next-generation non-volatile memory (NVM) requires low operating voltage and fast speed to save switching power (PS) for high-density memory application. However, further VD and PS reductions in a MOSFET are limited by the fundamental transistor physics of 60 mV/decade subthreshold swing (SS). The steep SS property not only lowers the PS but also reduces the DC off-state leakage (Ioff), as shown in Fig. 1. One proposed solution is to adopt ferroelectric MOSFET with a steep SS lower than 60 mV/dec [1]. However, a weak ferroelectric polarization at a scaled thickness is not sufficient to prevent performance degradation on memory window, data retention and high-temperature endurance [2], [3]. In this work, we proposed a 1T versatile memory with combining storage mechanisms of ferroelectricity (FE) and charge trapping (CT) to simultaneously reach sub-60 mV/dec operation and fast write/erase speed for power saving. The memory behaviors improved by excellent subthreshold performance are also investigated. Device Fabrication The p-MOSFETs using ferroelectric HfZrO (HZO) and charge-trapped ZrSiO (ZSO) dielectrics were fabricated. A 3.5-nm dry oxide was grown on Si as buffer layer, followed by HZO (22.5nm) and ZSO (7nm) film deposition and 400oC annealing. Subsequently, the 3.5-nm SiO2 was covered as a tunnel oxide.

In Fig. 3, a VT shift (ΔVT) of 1.2 V, minimum SS (SSmin) of 58 mV/dec, and Ion/Ioff ratio of 108 are measured in FE-HZO MOSFET with ±6 V bias sweep. To further improve memory performance, we employ a versatile memory integrating a CT node (ZSO) into FE-HZO. As shown in Fig. 4, the extra aligned dipoles formed near ZSO/HZO interface add toward the polarization electric field at the same drive voltage. The well-behaved ID-VD and ID-VGare shown in Fig. 5 (inset: TEM image of gate stack).

The large ΔVT window with various gate bias (Fig. 6) due to strong polarization enhancement facilitates multi-level operation and high-temperature endurance.

The m factor possibly becomes smaller than 1 to reach low SS (<60mV/dec) when 1T versatile NVM shows a negative capacitance effect [1] and dΨs/dVG >1. As for low SS property (Fig. 9), the <60mV/dec SS are measured at a wide VD range from 0.1 to 0.5V, and also reveals the decrease of SS with downscaling of channel length. Fig. 10 presents max. ΔVT of 2.8V under 20 ns pulse and pulse-dependent ΔVT at ±4V. The ΔVT window triggered by faster 20ns speed (inset) shows very slight degradation in comparison with DC sweep mode, which verifies a reliable switching response between ferroelectric domain and charge trapping. Although gate-injection charge tunneling may affect P/E speeds, faster pico-sec ferroelectric domain switching raises the speed up to ns level. Regarding sub-50ns P/E speeds, the measured ΔVT window of 1.9~2.1V are much larger than the saturated 0.3~0.4V of 1T FeNVM. Notably, a favorably low overdrive voltage (VG-VT) of <3V with a steep SS still provides a ΔVT window of 1.3V that is much better than that (0.9V ΔVT at ±4V) of FinFET DRAM with the best SSmin of 109 mV/dec [4]. We further evaluate the cycling endurance (Fig. 11). The versatile memory shows no significant degradation in ΔVT window with endurance beyond 1012 cycles even at higher 85oC. Since VT is sensitive to ferroelectric capacitance effect, a preferred read scheme adopting Ion/Ioff ratio to define sense margin is also tested. As shown in Fig. 12, sub-60mV/dec SS (m<1) can stabilize Ion/Ioff ratio (Ioff ∝10-VT/SS) and ΔVT due to low subthreshold leakage (Isubth ∝exp(VG/mVT)) to reach low drive voltage, uniform switch and long endurance. In Fig. 13, a stable and large Ion/Ioff ratio of ~107 is shown to exceed 1012 P/E cycles at 25oC. Furthermore, only slightly degraded Ion/Ioff (~106) is retained after extrapolation to 1016 cycles at 85oC. The extremely long endurance and high speed close to DRAM and sub-pJ switching energy like Flash NVM demonstrates the great potential for high-density & energy-efficient memory application. The high-temperature data retention is shown in Fig. 14. The improved retention of 103s at 85oC in versatile memory is superior to FeNVM, which can be ascribed to interface aligned dipoles, resisting depolarization field to delay retention time. Since the retention behavior is dominated by slow charge tunneling in CT layer, a long retention is expected by increasing ZSO thickness to enhance ferroelectric polarization stability.

We aim to provide a fast and efficient model to preselect substrates from a given pool for epitaxial growth of a target polymorph/material. Here we investigate two different approaches and a variety of criteria associated with each. In the following we present analyses, benchmarking, and recommendations for the following:• Homostructural epitaxy. where a chemically and structurally similar substrate material is selected based on common polymorph statistics, lattice matching, and energy above the hull. In this model the optimal orientation relationship between the film and the substrate is chosen as the smallest lattice mismatch between the common structures.• Heterostructural epitaxy. where the pool of candidate substrates can generally comprise any chemical system and the orientation relationship between the film and the substrate is obtained through a set of criteria based on the minimal interfacial geometry matching and estimated strain energy as a function of the substrate−film pair.Both models are explored and implemented within the infrastructure of the Materials Project and benchmarked using available literature",697

First, to obtain a sense of the accessible energy scale through various synthesis techniques we compare the calculated thermodynamic stability with available evidence of successful synthesis, for both VO2 and TiO2. Figure 2 shows the relative bulk formation energies (at T = 0) for the various VO2 structures and TiO2. For TiO2, PBE-DFT erroneously predicts anatase (−3.51 eV/atom) as the ground state at zero pressure. This is well within the standard DFT error on formation energies for oxides which is normally distributed with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 25 meV/atom.27The other three naturally occurring TiO2 polymorphs, i.e., rutile, brookite, and columbite, are close in energy, about 15−30 meV/atom higher than anatase. These",189

Because the strong lattice correspondence between the rutile and M1 phase and the small lattice expansion observed (1%),29 we will in this work consider them as one system, referred to as the “R/M” phase. Among the polymorphs considered for the VO2 system, the R/M phase exhibits the lowest formation energy (−2.48 eV/atom).

This approach is an improvement from traditional lattice parameter matching, which is is not applicable for systems where the epitaxial layer has a different orientation, or a completely different crystal structure, than the substrate. Additionally, while devoid of any chemical interaction between the target film and substrate, the model provides a rapid and robust geometrical screening and we select it for implementation in pymatgen39(the open python-based analysis software adopted for MP) and dissemination within the Materials Project Design environ-ment. In this process, we take advantage of existing surface modules and symmetry operations within pymatgen to generate all possible surface orientations of Miller index (hkl) below a certain cutoff and terminations.34,39The candidate substrates can be automatically selected from the Materials Project or generated from an external list. To accommodate a lattice match within the Zur and McGill model, the film is considered to be strained within the epitaxial plane. Hereafter, we will refer to this epitaxial plane as the x−y plane. If we assume the substrate surface is rigid with no structural relaxation perpendicular to the x−y plane, the strain energy (ΔEs) imposed on the film can be expressed as ΔEs = V · ex−y, where V is the volume of the film per atom and ex−yis the film strain energy density induced in the x−y plane.

Through this procedure, we can preliminarily identify appropriate substrates and the lattice orientations that geometrically fit the target polymorph film as a function of the film strain energy. We note that there is a DFT error affecting the energy ordering of systems as previously witnessed in the formation energies for VO2 and TiO2.

In the case of VO2, we are interested in finding appropriate substrates for growing the hitherto hypothetical anatase, brookite, and columbite polymorphs.

While the epitaxial constrain preferentially stabilizes the columbite phase among the considered phases, we also note that the energy difference between columbite and brookite is very small even up to 9% total strain, which may limit the phase selectivity.4.",927
Garten_ACSAMI_2018.docx,CONCLUSION,"In summary, driven by the need for rational polymorph selection during synthesis, we present a computational framework involving a combination of first-principles calcu-lations of formation energy, elastic strain energy, and topological lattice matching..

In this respect, doping is an effective way to bring about asym-metry within the structure, as shown in the present study and by a number of studies carried out for HfO2-based films.6,37 Our XPS measurement showed that Fe in the ZrO2 film assumes trivalent states, whose ionic radius (Fe3þ, 65 pm) is about 17% smaller than that of Zr4þ(78 pm). There are sev-eral possibilities for Fe3þto be incorporated into ZrO2. Namely, Fe3þions can substitutionally occupy Zr sites or they can go to interstitial sites, or in fact the combination of the two. Considering electrical neutrality, site relation and mass balance, the possible reactions can be summarized as follows:Fe2O3 �! ZrO2 2Fe0 Zrþ 3OO þ V��O;Fe2O3 �! 2ZrO2 Fe0 Zrþ Fe���iþ V0000 Zrþ 3OO þ V��O;Fe2O3 �! 2ZrO2 2Fe���iþ 2V0000 Zrþ 3OO þ V��O;FIG. 5.

It can be seen that simple substitution of Zr4þby Fe3þrequires creation of an oxygen vacancy. On the other hand, in order for Fe3þto stay interstitially within ZrO2, Zr sites must become vacant, resulting in Schottky disorder, and if all the Fe3þoccupy interstitial sites, the crystal must contain Frenkel-like defects formed by cations. We may then propose that substitutional occupation of Zr sites by Fe3þions is energetically most favorable, although other possibilities cannot be excluded. In essence, these factors favor not only the breakdown of local symmetry, but also the",502
choi2018.docx,introduction,"of a local strain field within the film, which needs to be accommodated. It should be mentioned here that the ionic radius of pentavalent Ta, which is reported to induce the o-phase,26is also smaller than that of Zr4þ.In fact, a comparison of the interface between the undoped ZrO2 film and the YSZ substrate [Fig. 4(a)] with that of doped ZrO2 [Fig. 4(b)] indicates that the doping of Fe into ZrO2 removes misfit dislocation. That is, the interface between the substrate and the fabricated Fe-doped ZrO2 thin film is coherent, as opposed to the semi-coherent interface for the case of undoped ZrO2. This observation is consistent with the aforementioned contraction of the pseudo-cubic lat-tice upon doping. Yet, as evidenced by the dark contrasts in the bottom regions of the Fe-doped ZrO2 film, which arise from the dynamical effects experienced by the imaging elec-trons, there exists a strain field in the region. This finding led us to conclude that the Fe-doped ZrO2 thin films do experi-ence a global external strain field from the substrate, which also favors the formation of the o-phase.In this study, the 0.06FeO1.5-0.94ZrO2 thin film exhib-ited a double hysteresis-like loop as shown in Fig. 5(a). There are some proposed mechanisms as to the emergence of a double hysteresis loop. One is antiferroelectricity caused by the t-phase, as reported for ZrO2 based thin films.9,38,39 However, the t-phase was not detected by HAADF-STEM [Fig. 4(b)]. The other possibility is a pinched loop by domain pinning. In order to check this possibility, we have cyclically applied electrical field and examined the response. The hys-teresis loop of the 0.06FeO1.5-0.94ZrO2 thin film did not change during field cycling (16 cycles), suggesting that the film indeed exhibits a pinched hysteresis loop. In fact, according to the previous reports, the electric field cycling (105–106cycles) has been known as one of the methods for demonstrating the domain pinning effects.40–49One cause of domain pinning is mobile defects such as oxygen vacan-cies.50–55As described above, the",543

We can there-fore put forward that the 0.06FeO1.5-0.94ZrO2 thin film exhibits the ferroelectricity arising from the polar o-phase, and the domain movement is prone to be inhibited to some degree by mobile defects, such as oxygen vacancies, doped Fe ions residing in Zr substitutional sites and/or interstitial sites.. In summary, we have demonstrated that Fe doping into epitaxially grown ZrO2 thin films can stabilize the polar o-phase.. HAADF-STEM showed that the Fe-doped ZrO2 thin film was character-ized by a multi-domain structure consisting of the o- and m-phases with misfit dislocations between them..

masuduzzaman_hotatomdamage_IEDM_2013.docx,Introduction,"Dielectric materials with memory functionalities have recently gained interest in much broader area of applications. This includes emergent non-volatile memories [1], novel phase change switches [2], and neuromorphic logic applications, such as adaptive oxide electronics [3]. Ferroelectric, being one such memory material, is of no exception, and its potential use has extended beyond the memory (FeRAM) [4] and actuators [5], to the gate-stack of transistors (NCFET) [6]. Although the reliability of the switchable polarization of ferroelectric materials have been studied extensively, and characterized by fatigue, imprint, endurance, etc. [7, 8], the stress induced leakage current (SILC), the time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) and failure distribution of ferroelectric materials have only been characterized and interpreted traditionally, as if it was a classical gate oxide [9-11]. In this paper, we compare the DC and AC TDDB lifetime of ferroelectric capacitors, and find that the traditional breakdown theories for gate oxides are not sufficient to explain the AC TDDB characteristics of materials with double-well energy structure. We demonstrate that the defect generation is accelerated by the hot atom at the domain walls in ferroelectric materials generated under certain operating conditions, which explains critical TDDB",274

The model suggests the use of pulse shaping to reduce such damage which has also been verified",83
masuduzzaman_hotatomdamage_IEDM_2013.docx,experiment,"ally (Fig. 12). Finally, we discuss on the TDDB lifetime for an arbitrary pulse shape by decoupling the AC and the DC damage modes (Fig. 13). Device Characterization The structures studied are metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitors [12] with the ferroelectric materials composed of industrial, state-of-the-art PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti)O3) with grain-size of ~100nm (Fig. 1c). The samples were either 70nm or 450nm thick. For 70nm samples, the polarization-voltage (P-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) hysteresis characteristics are shown in Fig. 1(a,b). Conductive AFM measurements show that grain boundary (GB) regions have (i) reduced thickness (ΔTOX~10nm), and (ii) higher leakage (IGB) due to higher pre-existing defects (Fig. 1c). To decouple the relative contributions of ΔTOX vs. pre-existing defects in IGB, we created a square trench on the oxide using an AFM tip (Fig. 1d). Even for a 20nm-deep trench (i.e., TOX� 70 � 20 �50nm), the oxide leakage (IOX) remains smaller than IGB outside the trench region (Fig. 1e), confirming the importance of pre-existing defects in defining GB leakage. DC Lifetime is Nothing Unusual Once the oxides are stressed at DC, we find that the TDDB characteristics are very similar to that of a traditional oxide: the TDDB lifetime (TBD) follows a power law with voltage, with a temperature-dependent exponent which implies activated defect generation (Fig. 2a). Indeed, at relatively low frequencies, the lifetime scales perfectly with duty cycle (�), indicating the absence of any relaxation (Fig. 2b). However, the Weibull slope (���) is remarkably small (~1.5) for a 70 nm thick capacitor. We have recently demonstrated that [13] the (DC) BD-spot is always located within the GBs (Fig. 4) and the low ��� reflects ‘electrical thinning’ of GB region due to the large number of pre-existing defects. The Puzzle of AC Lifetime and Hot Atom Damage Once the stress is switched to an AC pulse, TBD decreases dramatically, see Fig 3.For most reliability phenomena (e.g., TDDB, BTI, SILC), typically the AC lifetime is either larger (with recovery) or equal (when recovery is absent) to the derated DC lifetime of the capacitor [14-16]. In ferroelectrics, however, the AC TDDB lifetime is orders of magnitude smaller than that at DC bias (Fig. 3), indicating the presence of some additional damage U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright21.4.1IEDM13-566mechanism during the AC stress. We emphasize that, here we refer to the catastrophic dielectric breakdown, which is different from fatigue (loss of switchable polarization) at AC stress[8]. A fundamental difference between a traditional dielectric and a ferroelectric material is the double-well energy landscape of the latter [17], as a function of polarization (Fig. 5). For a complete switching of the memory state, the applied voltage (����) must exceed the coercive voltage (VC) so that the center (Zr/Ti) atom can cross the potential barrier. Hypothetically, if the AC TDDB damage is related to the repeated crossing of this barrier, the damage should be proportional to the number of the switching cycles (NCY). Fig. 6 confirms that it is indeed true, i.e., the stress induced leakage current (SILC) is determined by NCY, regardless the frequency (�). At very low � (at 50% d.c.), however, NCY is small as compared to the effective DC stress time. Hence we notice a shift in lifetime towards DC lifetime (Fig. 7), since the damage mode is dictated by the DC stress at such condition. To isolate the contributions of cyclic (switching) stress, we use an extremely narrow pulse train so that the DC damage is avoided. Remarkably, as the second confirmation of the HAD theory, the lifetime now simply scales linearly with frequency. Third, to find the effect of pulse amplitude, we use different pulse shapes as in Fig. 8a. As mentioned, for repeated switching, the AC pulse must include both ���levels (case iv, v). Otherwise, for a non-switching AC (case ii, iii), the center polarizing atom will just oscillate within a single well, effectively behaving like a traditional high-k dielectric under AC stress. For such cases (ii, iii), the lifetime is comparable with DC stress (Fig. 8b). However, as soon as the pulse becomes switching (case iv, v), there is a sharp decrease in lifetime, again relating the damage to the repeated crossing of atom across the barrier. Theoretically, during polarization switching (���� ���), the energy gained by the atoms at the domain walls, not only allows it to cross the central energy barrier, but also leads to an overshoot in the local polarization, until the energy is dissipated to the surroundings (Fig. 10). These transient polarization overshoots stretch the bonds around the domain walls and reduce the thermal activation energy [18] required for bond breakage (Fig. 11), and thus reduce TBD. Finally, unlike DC breakdown which is localized at the GB (with the consequence of low Weibull) [13], AC switching of atoms is inefficient at the GB edges due to the presence of defects. Rather, the switching of atoms occurs at the domain walls within the grains. Since the domain walls propagate across the grain regions during switching, the defect generation also happens along with the domain wall motion throughout the grain regions (Fig. 9a). As the pre-existing defect density at grain is considerably smaller than that of the GB, we see a dramatically sharper Weibull slope for an AC stress (Fig. 9b). The",1330
masuduzzaman_hotatomdamage_IEDM_2013.docx,results,"are supported by Monte Carlo simulation [13]. Optimization of Device Operation To minimize HAD, the AC pulse must be shaped to reduce the polarization overshoot. For example, one would expect a lower HAD using a pulse with slower transitions time. This is confirmed in Fig. 12a where the lifetime increases by order of magnitude, if the pulse has an increased transition time. In fact, the slower transition of the atoms allows lesser polarization overshoots and reduced bond stretching (increased lifetime). Second, since the polarization is maximized at resonant frequencies which would lead to increased HAD (Fig. 12b), this situation must be carefully avoided. Finally, since the DC and the switching damages are dictated by independent stress modes, one can characterize the Weibull distributions separately to find the lifetime for an arbitrary shape of the pulse (�, �). The final lifetime will be governed by the prorated DC and switching lifetime based on � and �, respectively, as shown in Fig. 13.",214

During the source/drain implant activation step, a fl ash anneal processing step at 1000 °C was applied. Besides the implant activation, the above-mentioned annealing step is conveniently used to crystallize the doped hafnia and to induce the ferroelectric phase. After the suc-cessful scaling to the state-of-the-art 28 nm high-k technology node [ 12,13 ] and device integration, [ 9,10 ] detailed studies of phys-ical mechanisms occurring within doped hafnium layers are needed. In general, memory devices require two or more dis-tinct states (binary 0 and 1 in case of the simplest two-level memory). The stability of these states has to be preserved for a certain number of cycles and after the required retention period depending on the application. [ 14 ] In case of the ferroelec-tric HfO 2 , a high-fi eld bipolar stress cycling impacts the mate-rial properties. The remnant polarization (i.e., Pr value) evolves with cycling showing two distinct trends (see Figure1 a): (i) “Wake-up”: the remnant polarization memory window, re-lates as the difference between positive and negative rem-nant polarization, increases with cycling.

Furthermore, a comprehensive modeling approach framework is developed and introduced to explain the electrical data in terms of phys-ical mechanisms responsible for the wake-up and the fatigue within the ferroelectric capacitor. 2. Phenomenological Analysis Pristine doped HfO 2 samples are usually characterized by double peaks in the current voltage characteristic and conse-quently, a pinched hysteresis loop. It is reported that pristine double peak behavior may originate from different built-in fi elds within the device stack. [ 20 ] Different built-in biases or a different fi eld manifestation on different grains and even portions of the stack can occur due to a nonuniform defect distribution, polycrystallinity of the annealed fi lm and k-value nonuniformity.

[ 17 ] Wake-up and fatigue behaviors are due to a complex inter-play among phenomena involving the ferroelectric properties (e.g., domain orientation, phase stability and fi eld induced phase transitions) and dielectric characteristics (e.g., defect activation/creation, charge injection and consequent trapping), that could induce a built-in bias. [ 18,19 ] Even though those studies offered valuable fi rst step insight into the behavior of these new materials, they were confi ned only to potential mechanisms separately and in a speculative manner. Therefore, a detailed study of the physical mechanisms responsible for the wake-up and fatigue phase in doped hafnium fi lms is strongly required. To this aim, we will show in the present work a comprehensive collection of",620

To address these fundamental challenges, initially, a detailed built-in bias screening evolution with fi eld cycling is presented in Section 2 . This is necessary to get an idea, of how charged defects and ferroelectric properties are distributed within the tion and assessment of the mechanisms of the wake-up and fatigued stages will be presented. 2.1. Built-In bias Screening The difference between positive and negative remnant polariza-tion, Pr+ / Pr− , is related to the memory window (MW). The MW evolution during cycling measured on Sr:HfO 2 -based capaci-tors is shown in Figure 1 . These types of plots are referred to as endurance plot with the word “endurance” being used to describe the ability of a material to withstand a certain number of switching cycles. The initial increase in the MW observed up to 10 3 cycles correlates with the “wake-up” effect as reported elsewhere. [ 15,16,20 ] With further fi eld cycling, the continuous switching of the polarization state reduces the MW. Besides the polarization–voltage ( P – V ) characteristics meas-ured during the endurance test, the current–voltage ( I – V ) char-acteristics were examined. Figure 1 b represents the I – V curves measured on the ferroelectric capacitor at the three stages of the lifetime: (ii) pristine; (iii) woken-up; (iv) fatigue stage. The I – V characteristic measured on the pristine sample is charac-terized by two distinct current peaks, which move toward each other with continuous bipolar cycling, eventually merging in the wake-up regime. Since the polarization-voltage character-istic is the integral of the transient current, this behavior rep-resents a transition of the initially pinched hysteresis loop to a so-called open hysteresis.

In parallel to the endurance behavior, the evolution of the static DC leakage current with the bipolar cycling was moni-tored (Figure 1 c). Leakage current spectroscopy represents a very powerful technique to examine the quality of a dielectric in terms of defects generated/activated within the dielectric layer during the bipolar cycling stress. Interestingly, leakage current remains constant up to 10 3 cycles, which corresponds to the 4602wileyonlinelibrary.com© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAdv. Funct.Mater.2016, 26, 4601–4612www.MaterialsViews.comwake-up stage. Further cycling resulted in signifi cant increase of the leakage current, accompanied by the reduction of the memory window as shown in Figure 1 a. The observed behavior indicates that new defects are generated within the dielectric stack during cycling resulting in an increased leakage current. On the other hand, the constant behavior of the leakage current in the fi rst 10 3 cycles suggests that in the wake-up phase, there is almost no generation of new defects assisting the charge transport through the trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) but a redis-tribution of the existing ones, as well as a change of their occu-pancy. Thus, the endurance trend in the wake-up phase seems to originate from changes in the ferroelectric properties of the Sr:HfO 2 layer. Nevertheless, defect creation/activation/diffu-www.afm-journal.destack becomes more uniform. The change of the built-in bias could be related to the distribution changes of atomic defects within the stack, which can either trap charge thus changing their charge states and the internal fi eld (e.g., oxygen vacan-cies [ 21 ] ) as well as local changes of the material either by phase transformation or vacancy movement under the infl uence of fi eld and temperature. With further cycling, the onset of the fatigue behavior is observed as the progressing decrease in Pr . To gain insight into the fatigue phase, measurements were performed in sim-ilar manner as for the woken-up case. That is, after the device was stressed with alternating switching pulses for 10 6 cycles FORC measurements were recorded. The pseudo-color plots in sion and charge trapping occurring within the dielectric layer Figure 2 b,c (wake-up and fatigue case) show that the maximum cannot be in principle excluded and, thus, requires an in-depth analysis. To deepen this study and access this behavior from the perspective of the resulting internal fi eld, the fi rst-order reversal curve (FORC) technique was employed. As reported by Schenk et al., [ 19 ] the FORC approach repre-sents a very powerful tool for the analysis of the evolution of the switching and back-switching fi eld distributions in doped HfO 2 -based ferroelectrics. This approach originates from the characterization of ferromagnetic materials [ 22 ] and has also been utilized for the characterization of the classic ferroelectric materials in the past decades. The FORC measurement proce-dure starts at a fi elds high enough to reach the saturation polar-ization, here the positive one. Subsequently, the fi eld is swept toward the negative direction and back to saturation, stepwise lowering the value of the reversal fi eld until the opposite (here the negative) saturation polarization is reached. A detailed [ 23,24 ] and simplifi ed mathematical treatment of the measured data as well as a coordinate transform to Ec and Ebias was described in Supporting Information S1. In contrast to the other studies, here the FORC technique is utilized to analyze the evolution of the build-in bias fi eld and coercive fi eld evolution with fi eld cycling of the device. As for the I – V characterization, the focus will be on pristine, wake up and fatigued phases, as shown in Figure 1 a. Utilizing the coordinate transformation (see Sup-porting Information S1) the Preisach density ρ is plotted as function of bias fi eld Ebias and coercive fi eld Ec in Figure2 . As shown in the Figure 2 a, the pristine sample is character-ized by two distinct regions in the Preisach/switching density plot, with two opposite bias fi elds and almost same coercive fi eld. The obtained",984

As shown before, [ 19 ] with fi eld cycling, the bias of these regions disappears resulting in maxima movement toward each other. The maxima fi nally end up merged around zero bias as depicted in Figure 2 b, following the trend of the current peaks in the I – V characteristics in Figure 1 b. Device cycling proves the initial existence of the internal bias fi elds and their disap-pearance with further cycling. Moreover, the current peak merging fully corresponds to an increase of the magnitude of the merging peaks, as well as to an increase in the remnant polarization observed in dynamic hysteresis measurements. This increase of the polarization indicates the increase of the number of domains participating in the switching process, whereas the disappearance of the built-in bias fi eld suggests that the fi eld distribution within the Preisach density decreases, and it is accompanied by slight biasing of the sample toward negative fi elds, which indicates an increasing asymmetry in the TiN/Sr:HfO 2 /TiN device stack. It is expected that due to the dielectric degradation (which pri-marily corresponds to the O vacancy generation [ 25,26 ] ) and con-sequent charge trapping, the ferroelectric layer experiences a lower effective fi eld. This reduces the number of switchable domains which",293

With increasing temperature, the number of the cycles needed to wake-up the sample decreases signifi -cantly (Figure 2 d). This strong temperature dependence of the wake-up indicates that indeed diffusion/drift process as well as the defect generation can be the responsible mechanism. However, the leakage current during the wake-up stage stays constant indicating that there are no new defects generated (see Figure 1 c). In addition, conditioning",103

The strong temperature acceleration of the wake-up phase suggests adopting higher temperatures to precondition the memory device cells to achieve more stable and uniform device performances. The cells were subjected to just two cycles at elevated temperatures after which the endurance test, i.e., stress and P-E measurement at room temperature were per-formed. With increasing conditioning temperature, the number of the wake-up cycles reduces signifi cantly and completely dis-appears at 150 °C as shown in Figure 2 e. In order to investigate the dielectric properties during the wake-up stage, the evolution of the DC leakage current curve with fi eld cycling was monitored (Figure 1 a). The leakage current remains constant during the wake-up phase (also at elevated temperatures), thus indicating that no new defects are created/activated in the bulk of the dielectric layer, which are those mostly contributing to the TAT leakage current. This means that a generation of new O vacancy defects is not responsible for the wake-up regime observed in the ferroelec-tric capacitor. A partial phase transformation and structural changes, however, are observed in high-angle annular dark-fi eld (HAADF) STEM, the full details of which will be included in a forthcoming publication.

The structure of this sample is expected to be similar to the electrically tested Sr:HfO 2 . Gd-doped HfO 2 fi lms show analog electrical behavior to the Sr:HfO 2 samples investigated in this work as already reported by Hofmann et al. [ 28 ] A more detailed comparison is presented in the Supporting Informa-tion S2. Monoclinic (paraelectric, PE) and orthorhombic (fer-roelectric, FE) grains were observed in the samples, with decreasing monoclinic presence and increasing orthorhombic presence for samples subjected to greater amounts of fi eld-cycling. Bulk grains adjacent to the electrode interfaces had a tendency to relax toward distorted tetragonal phase symmetry within the last few unit cells of HfO 2 next to the interfaces. Relaxation at the electrodes toward tetragonal symmetry was observed in samples from all three cycling conditions, though it was most pronounced in the pristine and least pronounced in the fatigued samples. Figure 2 f) shows STEM images of the HfO 2 /electrode interfaces for each cycling condition. The pristine sample exhibits the greatest tendency to relax toward tetragonal symmetry. The wake-up image shows some relaxa-tion toward the interface, but it seems to retain the phase of the bulk grain more than the pristine. The fatigued sample shows little to no relaxation at the interface. Beside the change in the ferroelectric response, observed phase changes should have signifi cant impact on the dielectric constant of the com-plete stack.

This is accompanied by an increase of the leakage current indicating a degradation of the stack, continuation of the phase transition and further drop of the total capacitance and k-value as well. 2.2. Mechanisms Mechanisms responsible for the wake-up and fatigue of the conventional ferroelectric materials were investigated in detail during the past 50 years. A huge number of publications pro-posed numerous scenarios dealing with increase and decrease of the polarization in perovskite-based materials. Wake-up studies on PZT material system were performed and reported before. [ 15,29,30 ] On the other hand, a very detailed and system-atic review of fatigue mechanisms was reported by Tagantsev et al. in 2001 [ 17 ] and Lou et al. in 2009. [ 31 ] These studies sug-gested that a combination of several mechanisms (domain de-/ pinning, [ 32 ] seed inhibition, [ 33 ] and formation of the passive/ dead layer [ 34 ] ) could be responsible for the device wake-up and fatigue. Even though these studies proposed a detailed discus-Figure 3. a) Evolution of the ferroelectric remnant polarization compared to leakage current during bipolar cycling measured on Sr:HfO 2 -based fer-roelectric capacitors; b) extracted defect concentration and bias fi eld evo-lution as well as c) capacitance cycling behavior.were performed as function of the external bias voltage ( C – V ). As for other",1356
Uwe_Cycling_TEM_HfO2_AFM_2016.docx,experiment,"s, capacitance evolution was also recorded during the fi eld cycling. Typical ferroelectric C – V curves are characterized by butterfl y hystereses with maxima that occur due to the contribution of domain wall capacitance around the coercive fi eld (during the polarization switching). The dielectric constant of complete stack (interfaces and bulk) was extracted from the most saturated region of the character-istics where contributions of the domain wall capacitance are minimal. Independently from the cycling stage, continuous total capacitance/k-value drop of 5% was observed (see Sup-porting Information S3 and Figure3 c). This behavior indicates that the T→O phase transformation (decrease of the k-value) in the interfacial region has a stronger impact on the total k-value than the M→O transformation (increase of the k-value) that occurs within the bulk. A detailed electrical model consisting of three serial capacitors for the two interfaces CIF and the fer-roelectric bulk Cbulk of the stack is given within the Supporting Information S3. Besides the continuous drop of the k-value, in Figure 3 c can be seen that the amount of the charge within the system (ratio of the peak value- Cmax and saturated capac-itance- Cmin ) completely match with evolution of the remnant polarization. Combining all electrical",289
Uwe_Cycling_TEM_HfO2_AFM_2016.docx,results,", some trends during the fi eld cycling can be isolated (Figure 3 ): Initially, during the wake-up stage: the polarization response increases, bias fi elds diminish whereas the leakage current stays constant. From the structural perspective, the stressed capacitor undergoes a phase transfor-mation of M→O and T→O in the bulk and interfaces, respec-tively. Both, the increase of the polarization response and the phase transition are accompanied by an increase of the total switching charge within the material system and continuous drop of the capacitance/k-value. With further fi eld cycling, the sion of the mechanisms, most of the literature only discusses phenomenological scenarios. In order to properly assess the complex physical inter-play governing the wake-up and degradation mechanisms in Figure4 , we show a sketch of potential interactions among mechanisms affecting either dielectric (i.e., defect—O vacancy and O ion—creation, diffusion, recombination) and ferro-electric (change of the remnant polarization by, e.g., domain wall pinning, seed inhibition and other modifi cations of the switching process) properties. These mechanisms are con-nected to each other and take place at both interfacial and in bulk regions. Therefore, they cannot be perfectly separated in reality. For instance: the ferroelectric switching degradation might be connected to defect, i.e., O vacancy creation and sub-sequent charge trapping. The defect creation depends on the fi eld, and increases with increasing fi eld due to the switching and ion displacement of the ferroelectric material during cycling. [ 35 ] As it can be seen from Figure 3 , the relation of the mechanisms within the stack is of rather complex nature neces-sitating in-depth studies. As every high-k material, [ 36 ] Sr:HfO 2 is characterized by a certain amount of oxygen vacancies within the material (see Supporting Information S4 for an estimate). The application of the alternating bipolar cycling voltage represents the main source of stress: It causes the injection of charges into existing vacancies, which can change the polarization state of the ferroe-lectric material via local fi eld modifi cations [ 21 ] as well as domain de-/pinning. This can result in either a rise or a degradation of the remnant polarization. Furthermore, the applied fi eld can either generate new O/Hf vacancies or force the existing ones to diffuse along the material. As a consequence of the vacancy diffusion and generation, a portion of the device volume can undergo a phase transformation. This transformation into a switching or nonswitching phase together with the k-value change can either impede or facilitate the ferroelectric response by changing the internal bias fi eld. In the following, these mechanisms will be assessed in detail, using a special series of",583

As discussed before, the wake-up effect is attributed to the gradual decrease of the built-in bias fi eld. These could be due to the O vacancy defect redistribution that can change their charge state, and/or partial phase transition and k-value change within The initial scenario of different biased regions and the so-called built-in fi elds was created by preferentially highest density of the vacancies in the interfacial regions ( Figure6 ). Furthermore, the same scenario was used to simulate the pref-the layer. erable movement of the vacancies driven by the applied electric The same model was also used for the simulation of the leakage current evolution with cycling (see Figure 1 c), which allows extracting the increase in the density of O vacancy defects within the stack. The increase of density of the oxygen vacancy defects seems correlated with the Pr evolution observed with cycling, Figure 3 b. However, it should be noted that the density of defects evaluated from the leakage current corre-sponds mainly to those located at the grain boundaries, where they contribute the most to the leakage current. [ 45 ] Namely, the leakage current thought the grain boundaries is more than tenfold higher than through the grain itself. Thus, the diffu-sion of the vacancies thought the grain would keep the leakage current constant during the wake-up stage. The role of O vacancy/ion diffusion is also consistent to the fact that HfO 2 based devices are known for their high oxygen mobility. [ 18 ] This claim becomes even more strengthened by the fact that the electric fi eld applied on the HfO 2 -based ferroelectrics is at least one order of magnitude higher than that, typically applied fi eld. In order to investigate the physics of the wake-up process, bipolar cycling stress simulations were performed using the MDLab simulation package, which allows the description of charge and ionic transport. As shown in the Figure 6 a–c, the O vacancies redistribute uniformly within the grain. Moreover, besides this drift/diffusion process, a recombination of vacan-cies and interstitial ions can also occur. As a consequence, the built-in bias fi eld decreases. A more uniform fi eld distribution is created within the stack, resulting in a uniform switching of all domains within the device (see Figure 6 d–f). An increase of the temperature kinetically accelerates the vacancy diffusion resulting in more mobile vacancies and faster wake-up, which is in agreement to Figure 2 e. In order to confi rm the infl uence of the temperature observed in the wake-up characterization on elevated temperatures, the simulation was repeated at 150 °C. The uniform fi eld distribution was achieved two orders of mag-nitude faster than in the room temperature case, which cor-responds to the",633

Uwe_Cycling_TEM_HfO2_AFM_2016.docx,results,"that show the transition of the initially tetragonal phase of nonswitching TM-HfO 2 interface to orthorhombic phase (switching) for the woken up device. A thickness reduction of this dead layer [ 34 ] on the interface decreases the infl uence of the parasitic voltage divider and increases the ferroelectric switching response of the device. Thus, the remnant polarization increases during the wake-up. Although the vacancies move toward the middle of the device, the leakage current stays constant because it is dominated by the leakage through the grain boundaries and not through the grain volume. Therefore, vacancies that move during the wake up phase, indeed increase the leakage current component through the grains however insignifi cantly to be seen in the total current. Moreover, the observed phase tran-sition (M → O phase) increases the k-value of the stack. This reduces the fi eld driven leakage transport mechanisms coun-teracting the aforementioned negligible increase of the leakage component via the grain volume. In parallel to the compact modeling of the diffusion pro-cesses and evolution of the fi eld distribution within the device, a ferroelectric switching modeling is needed to compare the charge and fi eld infl uence on the switching of the device. Accordingly, a 3D ferroelectric capacitor model was set-up in Synopsys TCAD Structure Editor. [ 38 ] The model is illustrated in To model the ferroelectric behavior a physical model accounting for the history dependence of ferroelectric devices is required. In case of a ferroelectric capacitor the charge-voltage relationship is nonlinear and represents a second term of the dielectric displacement vector (see Supporting Information S5 for details). This complex behavior is very similar to the Prei-sach hysteresis model, which is used for ferromagnetic and fer-roelectric materials [ 51 ] and it is implemented within Sentaurus Device. [ 38 ] Properties of the modeled ferroelectric material can be found in the Supporting Information S6, where the para-meters are tuned in order to obtain the desired characteristics. Every measured capacitor consists of thousands of grains, [ 50 ] which all might have a slight different domain orientation, coercive fi eld or remnant polarization. To address the vari-ability in the resulting switching characteristics, each of the modelled grains represents an averaged ensemble of domains and grains with similar properties, which are defi ned by a distinct coercive fi eld and remnant polarization value. Coer-cive fi elds used within the grains were chosen in the range of 1.6–2.9 MV cm −1 which is in accordance to the coercive fi eld distribution obtained by FORC measurements (see Supporting Information S1). Moreover, the remnant polarization of the grains was distributed between the 15 and 24 µC cm −2 . Finally, a nonlocal mesh is constructed in order to calculate the tun-neling currents and to couple the traps with the electrodes. The initial stack is also affected by the presence of defects, whose charge can unpredictably alter the local fi eld, affecting the ferroelectric switching performances. To account for this effect, it was considered that oxygen vacancies are preferentially 4608Figure 5 b. distributed at the interfacial regions. These regions are mainly wileyonlinelibrary.com© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAdv.

Moreover, these regions are considered nonswitching in the pristine, i.e., they act as a passive (dead) layer.

In addition, an earlier onset of the Having detailedly discussed the effects dominating the so-called wake-up, which lead to an enhancement of the ferroelec-tric properties during the initial cycles, the subsequent gradual degradation of these properties is studied. As shown in Figures 1 c and 3 b, there is a direct correla-tion between the increase of the defect concentration and the degradation of the MW. Using the thermochemical bond breakage model implemented in the MDLab software, [ 37,44,52 ] it was found that a faster O vacancy defect generation occurs at the TiO x interface toward the electrodes. These low quality, nonswitching regions are characterized by more defects and a lower permittivity, resulting in a higher factor of degradation and faster bond breakage. The defect generation and the sub-sequent charge trapping infl uence the fi eld distribution over the device stack. The fi eld over the interface increases, while it reduces inside the ferroelectric bulk. [ 35 ] Thus, the ferroelec-tric layer experiences a lower switching fi eld, which leads to a reduced number of switching domains if the coercive fi eld of some domains is not reached anymore. Furthermore, charge trapping creates dipoles impeding the switching of the domains, which",451

Besides that, the vacancy generation and dif-fusion through the grains continue. In contrast to the wake-up phase, the continued cycling is not only characterized by vacancies diffusion, but also by a vacancy generation within the grains. These defect sites, fi nally, start representing sig-nifi cant leakage current path besides previously dominating leakage through the grain boundaries.

We have developed a non-disruptive eNVM process and show JTAG-controlled array,64
Rice_Miko_Trentzsch_GF_64kb_FERAM_IEDM_2016.docx,Experiment,"al Details The test vehicle (Fig. 1) comprises several 64 kbit FeFET arrays with NOR and AND architectures and different transistor dimensions ranging from 30 nm x 80 nm to 500 nm x 500 nm. Each 1T memory cell can be accessed individually for write operations and parametric measurements via an integrated decoder circuitry. The logic state of each device is detected by an on-chip current sense amplifier. The chip features a JTAG interface for addressing and configuration of the step sequence. Since the chip mainly acts as a multiplexer, neither on-chip charge pumps nor clock generators are required. Voltage pulses for writing and readout are generated externally. GLOBALFOUNDRIES high-volume gate-first 28nm HKMG super low power platform (28SLP, Table I). The simultaneous integration of CMOS devices together with the FeFET on the same chip is demonstrated (Fig. 2). The FeFET gate stack (material, thickness, etc.) can be optimized independently from the baseline 28nm device integration. An arbitrarily mixed placement of CMOS and FeFET devices in the same circuit is possible with platform logic design rules. B.Platform Compatibility The fully CMOS compatible embedded FeFET integration scheme requires two additional structural DUV-masks. The electrical device parameters of the 28SLP platform are not shifted by the FeFET integration as shown exemplarily for the logic device performance in Fig. 3. The additional process steps do not increase the defectivity level as was demonstrated on a matured high-volume product (not comprising an actual FeFET area) where the implemented FeFET module did not affect the D0-limited yield. The current integration scheme enables a direct transfer of the FeFET module into more advanced technologies, like the 22FDXTM platform.

As compared to classical FRAM, the 1T architecture allows for non-destructive reads and a memory operation comparable to that of eFLASH cells. The domain-driven ferroelectric switching behavior [4] for a 500x30 nm2 device is shown in Fig. 5b and observed to be extremely abrupt, indicating high stability against disturbs. For positive gate pulses the VT shifts to lower values at around VG=3 V, whereas for negative gate pulses around 4 V the VT shifts to higher values. Pulse lengths at the moment are still in 1-10 µs range, gated by the external pulse generation. Shorter pulse lengths are beneficial for endurance and fast read-out after writing, as it shifts the balance between two contradictory mechanisms, trapping and polarization, in a favorable direction [5]. 978-1-5090-3902-9/16/$31.00 ©2016 IEEE11.5.1IEDM16-294D.64 kbit Macro F.Benchmarking In order to verify the effective addressability of arrays within the chip, the functionality of the JTAG interface was tested across the wafer (Fig. 6). A full functionality could be observed for a wide range of addressing voltages. The distribution of high-VT and low-VT states was investigated considering single devices connected in a 64 kbit AND array. To this purpose a stripe pattern was programmed which consisted in erasing the complete array by block erase and writing the low-VT state in cells along every second word-line (WL). As shown in Fig. 7 a clear distinction between the two states has been achieved. The two distributions are visualized in the histogram of Fig. 8. The reverse programmed pattern is also shown with a very similar distribution. Fig. 9 shows the fully normal distributed states with a clear separation of their mean values by a factor of ~10 and without any remaining superposition. Parasitic charge trapping effects (esp. for the low-VTdistribution) and non-uniform ferroelectric film properties among cells [4] are being further optimized. The cross-wafer signature of overlapping cells in Fig. 10 is related to variations of the ferroelectric film properties (thickness and doping) caused by the ALD cross flow profile [3]. A correlation of the number of overlapping cells to the drain current ratio is visible in Fig. 11. Single cell access was demonstrated by successfully writing a low-VT checkerboard pattern after block erase (Fig. 12). It should be noted that the data presented here are showing the natural/intrinsic low-VT and high-VT distribution after single pulse programming. More advanced programming schemes such as incremental step pulse programming (ISPP) or verify algorithms can be used for further optimization. Alongside error-correction code (ECC) and further material optimization will stabilize memory operation towards Mbit arrays. E.Endurance and Retention Performance of the array was explored by means of endurance and retention tests. Fig. 13a shows the distributions of the two states after the array has been subjected to 100 and 104 bipolar cycles. Evolution of the endurance up to 106 is shown in Fig. 13b indicating a gradually reduction of the ferroelectric memory window starting at 105 cycles. The low-VT state is mainly affected by the degradation which has been investigated in previous studies on single devices [6]. This behavior is attributed to the wear-out of the interfacial layer between HfO2 and silicon substrate and the consequent increase of charge injection (Fig. 14). The interfacial layer has not been optimized yet and endurance beyond 105 cycles is expected based on previous publications [7,8]. The data retention was tested at 105 °C for 72 h and at elevated temperatures of 250 °C for 1 min (tester limited to ≤250 °C). The programmed pattern was entirely preserved after the bake time (Fig. 15a) confirming the high thermal stability of the ferroelectric hafnium oxide. The time-dependent retention at 105 °C (Fig. 15b) shows an initial degradation (after 1 min) of the high-VT state whereas the cell state separation is stable afterwards for longer stress-times. The FeFET, as a one-transistor (1T) based embedded memory implemented in the FEoL, can be directly bench-marked against eFLASH solutions that are currently being developed on HKMG technology platforms. These embedded FLASH technologies have a long history of development and testing that has earned them a large customer acceptance and trust ranging from consumer up to automotive products. However, when comparing the unique physical mechanism controlling the threshold voltage shift in FeFETs to the charge based programming of FLASH technologies the potential of the ‘Generation 1’ FeFET to emerge as a superior technology is clearly revealed (see Table II): (1) Opposed to the energy inefficient hot carrier injection of eFLASH at high Gate and S/D voltages (only a small portion of the programming current reaches the floating gate) the FeFET is programmed at low gate voltages using the electric field for polarization switching. The energy/bit consumption and array efficiency due to a downsizing of charge pumps and scaling of channel length is accordingly improved. The scalability of the bit-cell is mainly limited by the ~4 V power routing and less by ferroelectric high-k film thickness which has been demonstrated to retain its ferroelectric properties down to 6 nm [9]. (2) Opposed to the charge based storage mechanism of FLASH devices the concept of ferroelectric switching provides radiation hardness and allows for ultra-fast switching in the nanosecond range. (3) The simplicity of the FeFET device (e.g. no Floating-Gate, no Erase-Gate, no IPD, etc.) and its close resemblance to the HKMG base device greatly facilitates its manufacturing and lowers mask adders significantly. III.SUMMARYA fully functional 64 kbit FeFET eNVM array embedded into a 28nm HKMG CMOS technology has been fabricated and characterized. The binary cell states of the FeFET are clearly separated and initial retention and endurance data is reported. The FeFET can be seamlessly integrated into a generic gate-first HKMG CMOS logic platform, like 22FDXTM and is likely transferable also to gate-last and FinFET technologies.",1441

FE_FinFET.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Due to recent trends of increasing system core-count and memory bandwidth bottleneck, large size on-chip caches are pursued to effectively reduce the performance gap between processor and main memory. Suffering from the large cell size and increasing leakage of SRAM, frustrations with SRAM for majority real estate occupation and unsatisfying scaling performance were encountered by chip designer. To overcome the limitations of SRAM, alternate memory technologies, such as eDRAM and STT-RAM were explored as a substitution of SRAM(Fig.1).[1]However, eDRAM suffers from poor data retention and scaling limitation below 1z node. Other alternates with better scaling potential and non-volatility are needed. On the other hand, e-NVM in SOC chip is also suffering from the limitation of e-FLASH integration on the advanced technology node. BEOL based memories, such as STT-RAM and RRAM were proposed as the possible solutions at 40 nm and 22 nm node(Fig.2).[2, 3]However, for the e-NVM solution at 10 nm node or beyond, there still is no candidate identified. In this work, we proposed a Fe-FinFET memory device with HfZrO (HZO) ferro layer as the gate dielectric for both 1T e-DRAM and e-NVM applications. The coexistence of charge trapping (CT) and domain switching (DS) phenomenon was observed. As the operation voltage <3V, charge trapping effect was dominant, and as the operation voltage >5V, domain switching of HZO layer occurred. Both of the CT and DS behavior exhibit high operation speed (<20ns). High endurance of more than 1012and good data retention of 104s were achieved in CT mode, which is quite promising for e-DRAM application.

Higher annealing temperature will result in stronger true-remanent polarization. The result shows there is almost no influence of thin 5nm TiN TE on the ferroelectricity compared with the thicker TiN TE. On the contrary, a slight 978-1-7281-1987-8/18/$31.00 ©2018 IEEE2.6.1IEDM18-47enhancement was observed. The coercive voltage of the Si/IL/HZO/TiN structure is larger than the control sample withTiN/HZO/TiN structure[3], which was resulted from the voltage drop on SiO2 IL (Fig.8).The trap in the HZO layer could be analyzed by Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) which is generated by electron capture/emission in the trap site.Fig. 9a and b show the RTN signal of IG measured under 2.5V with SR=105Hz. Five peaks RTN signal was observed (Fig. 9c).The PSD result shows that multi-traps existed in the HZO layer (Fig.9d). As shown�in�Fig. 10, the charge trapping induces VT shift, which is opposite��o the VT shift caused by the ferroelectric domain switching in�the same polarity of the gate voltage. For example, holes trapped in the gate dielectric at positive gate voltage result in a positive shift of the VT. On the other hand, positive ferroelectric polarization induced by the same positive gate voltage leads to a negative VT shift. Both of charge trapping and ferroelectric switching was found in the same FinFET device with a Si/IL/HZO/TiN/TaN/TiN/W gate stack. As shown in Fig. 11, after a -5V voltage sweep, the polarization was poled up and holes were trapped in the HZO layer. The VT was shift to -1.5V due to the domination of charge tapping effect. After 1 V voltage sweep, the VT begins to move to the positive side. As the sweep voltage increased to around 3V, the charge trap memory window reached to the peak value.

For the 1T-DRAM application, some critical properties need to be solved, such as high speed, high endurance and low power.

Rampi_Orthorhombic_antiferroelectric_JPCC_2017.docx,ABSTRACT,": The surprising ferroelectricity displayed by hafnia thin films has beenattributed to a metastable polar orthorhombic (Pca21) phase. Nevertheless, the conditions under which this (or another competing) ferroelectric phase may bestabilized remain unresolved. It has been hypothesized that a variety of factors, including strain, grain size, electric field, impurities and dopants, may contribute to the observed ferroelectricity. Here, we use first-principles computations to examine the influence of mechanical and electrical boundary conditions (i.e., strain and electric field)on the relative stability of a variety of relevant nonpolar and polar phases of hafnia. We find that although strain or electric field, independently, do not lead to a ferroelectric phase, the combined influence of in-plane equibiaxial deformation and electric field",192
Rampi_Orthorhombic_antiferroelectric_JPCC_2017.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Although hafnia is a well-known and well-studied high dielectric constant (“high-k”) material,1−7there has been renewed excitement about this material due to recent empirical observations of ferroelectricity in thin hafnia films, in both pure and doped forms.8−10These ferroelectric (FE) measure-ments along with excellent Si compatibility, easy complemen-tary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integration, and high scalability make hafnia a promising candidate for future nonvolatile memory applications over conventional perov-skite-based materials.10However, these FE property observa-tions are rather surprising since all the known equilibrium phases of hafnia, namely, the room temperature monoclinic (M) P21/c phase, the high temperature tetragonal (T) P42/nmc and cubic (C) Fm3̅m phases, and the high-pressure orthorhombic (OA) Pbca and (OB) Pnma phases, are centrosymmetric and hence nonpolar.11Grazing incidence and θ−2θ X-ray diffraction investigations on these thin FE hafnia films have suggested the presence of a polar orthorhombic (P-O1) Pca21 phase as the origin of this unexpected FE behavior.10In fact, Sang et al.12in a combined TEM and nanoscale electron diffraction study were able to identify the polar P-O1 phase in a FE hafnia film. However, remarkable structural similarity between different phases of hafnia, especially the P-O1 and the OA phases, and limited statistics owing to the small film thicknesses (<20 nm) lead to some degree of uncertainty in these",381

More importantly, a shallow kinetic energy barrier between the T and the aforementioned polar phases was also reported, suggesting their possible formation from the T phase. The fact that all FE thin films of hafnia have been reported to contain some volume fraction of the T phase17makes this finding even more intriguing with respect to the formation pathway of the FE phase(s). Figure 1 portrays the low-energy M, T, OA, P-O1, and P-O2 phases discussed above, for unit cells oriented in an equivalent manner. The equivalent orientations of different phases are discussed in later sections.Besides identifying the potential FE phase(s) in hafnia films, many efforts, both empirical and theoretical, have been made to determine extrinsic factors which may stabilize a polar phase. Among various factors, the grain size is undoubtedly a critical one.10Almost all studies on FE hafnia films have demonstrated a monotonic decrease in the spontaneous polarization of films with increasing film thickness, which is proportional to the hafnia grain size. A critical grain size of ∼20 nm was identified above which the FE behavior eventually disappears.10The increasing volume fraction of M phase with increasing film thickness (or grain size) was ascribed as the reason for this observation. Although finite size effects are known to stabilize the nonpolar T phase in hafnia (and its twin oxide, zirconia) at small length scales,15,18we have suggested in the past that surface orientations and grain size may lead to a stabilization ofReceived:November 28, 2016phases of hafnia has been predicted to be small over wide temperature and pressure ranges.13Additionally, anotherRevised:January 23, 2017Published: February 2, 2017© 2017 American Chemical Society4139DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b11972 J.

The polarization directions of the two polar phase are represented by P⃗1 and P⃗2. Hf and O atoms are shown in green and red colors, respectively.the P-O2 or the T phase in hafnia.14Observations of distinct FE behavior in pure hafnia thin films (6−10 nm) further strengthen the notion that surface energy plays a vital role in the stabilization of the FE phase.19Furthermore, on the basis of a phenomenological model of the surface energies of different polymorphs of hafnia, Materlik et al.20were able to explain the origins of ferroelectrcity and antiferrolectricity in HfZrO2 and ZrO2 thin films, respectively.Another important factor is the residual stresses in these films. One source of stress is from the mechanical barrier provided by the capping of the top and the bottom electrodes during crystallization of the films. Additionally, there is an anisotropic stress introduced due to the lattice and thermal coefficient mismatch between the film and the substrate. Studies from Kisi et al.21and Park et al.22have suggested the possibility of the T to P-O1 transformation due to in-plane compressive and out-of-plane tensile stresses in the (a, b) plane and along the c-direction, respectively, of the T phase.Observations of antiferroelectricity, the “wake-up effect”, and“fatigue” behavior in hafnia films have also insinuated the possibility of electric field induced stabilization of the hafnia FE phases.17,23Particularly interesting, and relevant to this work, is the “wake-up effect”. This term was coined to describe the phenomenon of improving (and/or inducing) FE loops of hafnia films, which displayed no apparent ferroelectricity in their pristine form, through electric field cycling. Dopants present in these films are yet another important factor.10While it is generally agreed upon that their presence enhances the thermodynamic window to stabilize the FE phase, whether they have any principal role in the appearance of the FE phase remains uncertain. Although thermal effects are known to stabilize the tetragonal and the cubic phases of hafnia at high temperatures of ∼2000 and ∼2800 K,11they are not expected to have a significant role at room temperatures at which these ferroelectric measurements are made.From the previous",1081

For example, the a- and b-axes of the standard P-O1 phase were reoriented as c- and a-axes, respectively. The findings of the past studies (within parentheses) have also been modified appropriately for comparison.bReference 13.cReference 31.dReference 32.eReference 33.thus resulting in an in-plane stress condition. Such constrained relaxation produced a uniform deformation of the cell and thus allowed us to simulate in-plane stresses while preserving the space group symmetry of a phase. Further remarks rationalizing the restriction to equibiaxial deformations to model anisotropic stresses will be made in later sections.In order to understand the impact of electric field on the phase stability of hafnia, energies of different phases under the influence of an electric field were also computed. The energy of a phase α with volume V0 α and under an electric field E⃗ was calculated using the expression28E α = E DFT α−V 0 α ( ϵ r α ϵ 0 E⃗ + P α ) E (1)where EDFT α is the DFT computed energy, P⃗αand ϵr α are the spontaneous polarization and matrix representation of the relative permittivity of the phase α, respectively, and ϵ0 is the permittivity of vacuum. Since E⃗is a vectorial quantity, its effect is dependent on its magnitude as well as direction. From eq 1 it is evident that the effect of electric field on the energy of a phase is maximized when the dot product P⃗α·E⃗is maximum, i.e., when the electric field is oriented parallel to the polarization direction of a polar phase. Thus, two important orientations of electric fieldparallel to the polarization vectors P⃗1 and P⃗2 of the polar phases P-O1 and P-O2, respectively (see Figure 1)were studied in this work. Further, for each orientation, we consider the phase stability under three different states, i.e., the stress-free, the hydrostatic, and the in-plane stress states. The density functional perturbation theory and the Berry phase evaluation were respectively employed to obtain the relative permittivity matrix and the spontaneous polarization of the different phases of hafnia. Spontaneous polarization computa-tions were repeated using the ABINIT29package to further verify the VASP computed values.■",1297

Assuming orientational independenceof dielectric response in the case of nonpolar phases, the secondterm on right side of eq 1 can be reduced to −V 0 α ( ϵ α r ) ϵ | ⃗| 2,where ϵα rrepresents the average of the trace of the dielectric tensor, ϵr α. This term represents the effect of inducedpolarization on the free energy, is always negative, and varies parabolically with the applied electric field E⃗. Thus, among thenonpolar phases, the phase with highest relative permittivity (ϵr α), i.e., the T phase, shows maximum parabolic change in the free energy with the applied electric field. In the case of polar phases, however, the dot product −V0 αP⃗·E⃗ forms the dominant term, particularly when the electric field is oriented parallel tothe direction of spontaneous polarization of a polar phase. Thus, one can observe significant stabilization (destabilization)of the P-O1 or the P-O2 phase, relative to the M phase, when the applied electric field is oriented parallel (opposite) to the direction of polarization. We also note that the polarization directions of the two polar phases subtend an angle of 138°, leading to P⃗·E⃗terms with opposite signs and thus contrary changes in the free energy. From Figure 3a we conclude that electric field (<5 MV/cm) cannot stabilize any of the two metastable polar phases in bulk hafnia; however, it can significantly reduce their energies closer to the equilibrium M phase, especially in the case of the P-O1 phase.Given this observation, one may reasonably suppose that under the combined effect of electric field and other relevant factors, such as stress, dopants, oxygen vacancies, etc., pervasive in hafnia films, the P-O1 phase becomes the most stable phase. Particularly, the factors that destabilize the M phase can be expected to produce such conditions. On the basis of our previous findings, we already know that compressive stress (hydrostatic or in-plane) is one such factor that stabilizes OA and P-O1 phase relative to the M phase. Thus, we consider next the combined effect of compressive stresses and electric field on the phase stability of hafnia.Panels b and c of Figure 3 present the variation of free energy of hydrostatically compressed (with volume ∼126 Å3) and equibiaxially deformed (along the (001) plane with a, b = 4.96 Å) phases of hafnia.

Rampi_Orthorhombic_antiferroelectric_JPCC_2017.docx,CONCLUSION,"SIn summary, we explored the independent as well as the combined influence of mechanical and electrical boundary conditions toward stabilization of a FE phase in hafnia. Two variants of mechanical boundary conditions; i.e., hydrostatic and in-plane stress states were examined. While hydrostatic compressive stresses were shown to stabilize the high pressure orthorhombic (Pbca) phase, in agreement with the empirical phase diagram of bulk hafnia, an even more significant finding of this work is that compressive stresses, both hydrostatic and in-plane, stabilize the polar orthorhombic (Pca21) phase of hafnia with respect to the equilibrium monoclinic phase. In fact, in-plane compressive stresses, which are particularly relevant in thin films, stabilize this polar phase relatively more than the hydrostatic pressures.Two variants of electrical conditions, with an applied electric field parallel to the polarization directions of the polar Pca21 and Pmn21 phase of hafnia, were also studied. They too were found to significantly reduce the relative energies of the two polar phases of hafnia. However, neither the mechanical nor the electrical boundary conditions independently lead to the stabilization of a FE phase of hafnia as the equilibrium phase. Nonetheless, under the combined influence of compressive stresses and electric field, we found that the polar Pca21 phase can, indeed, become the equilibrium phase in bulk hafnia. Interestingly, the predicted magnitude of electric field at which this polar phase becomes stable falls well within the empirical range wherein the “wake-up effect” has been observed in hafnia films. These findings not only suggest compressive stresses and electric field as possible control parameters to better tune the FE characteristics of hafnia films, but more importantly, they show that multiple factors, operating in concert, may be responsible for the formation of the ferroelectric phase in hafnia films.■ASSOCIATED CONTENT■",411

Volltext (PDF).docx,Introduction,"Ferroelectricity was first discovered in Rochelle salts in 19211,2. The observed hysteresis shared strong similarities with ferromagnetism, thus giving it its name ferroelectricity. The discovery of ferroelectric behavior in perovskite structure materials, first in barium titanate (BaTiO3) in 1944, strongly expanded the group of known materials with ferroelectric prop-erties in the following years. This symmetry group also contains many other commonly used ferroelectrics like lead titanate zirconate (PZT).3 Since ferroelectric materials form a hysteresis and can therefore resemble two differ-ent states, its application as a memory device briefly followed. The first patent for a ferro-electric field-effect transistor (FeFET) was already proposed in 1957, and the integration of many ferroelectric based non-volatile memory devices was demonstrated in the late 1980s to the beginning of the year 2000.3However, many of these technologies faced severe challenges due to limited scalability or incompatibility with complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes of the microelectronic industry. Nevertheless, these ferroelectric materials are nowadays used in a wide range of applications like sen-sors and actuators in fields outside or only in niche products of micro- and nanoelectron-ics.The field of ferroelectric non-volatile memories, however, gained traction again with the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide in 20084and its publication in 20115. Since this material was already commonly used in high-k-metal-gate (HKMG) CMOS processes at that time and did not face thickness scaling limitations, it is able to overcome the limita-tions of previous ferroelectric non-volatile memories. Consequently, this spurred interest in this new class of fluorite structure based hafnium and zirconium oxides and the stabi-lization of the ferroelectric phase was shortly after demonstrated in a wide range of doping elements.Nevertheless, the metastable nature of the ferroelectric phase in this material system introduces challenges on the process development to suppress other phases. Moreover, do many films behave antiferroelectric-like (AFE-like) initially but transit to ferroelectric1behavior upon cycling. This effect is known as wake-up and is currently not understood into depth. While many theories, like phase transitions and domain wall pinning, have been proposed, no conclusive evidence has been presented as of yet. In addition, FeFETs still face reliability challenges in the field of variability, endurance and retention.While there are still challenges present, HfO2-based FeFETs are a promising candidate for emerging non-volatile memories and have already been integrated into highly scaled 28 nm6and 22 nm7technology nodes. Due to the increasing demand on artificial in-telligence and neural networks, classical computer architectures face limitations due to the von-Neumann bottleneck and new architectures, like brain-inspired (neuromorphic) computing, which implement near- or in-memory computing are required to overcome this bottleneck. Those novel circuit designs, however, require embedded non-volatile de-vices with a large number of intermediate states not available in current CMOS technology nodes, but FeFETs are a promising candidate to fulfill the requirements.This work explores the physical origin of the wake-up effect, process influences on the microstructure of the hafnium oxide thin films and the influences on reliability aspects of non-volatile memory and neuromorphic devices. Consequently, it aims to provide in-sight into the interaction between the physics on unit cell, microstructure and the device level. As a result, guidelines on the material development of doped hafnium oxide for non-volatile memory applications are given alongside. For this purpose, a brief",826

Afterwards, the methodology of electrical and structural characterization of hafnium oxide films is explained.. Here, the novel method of transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) is introduced, which allows to visu-alize the microstructure of hafnium oxide.. Details on the sample preparation are provided as well.. The following chapters are then organized by the aforementioned levels, starting with the physical behavior on unit cell level, followed by the influences on the microstruc-ture and finally the reliability aspects and synaptic properties of FeFETs.. 2 2 Theoretical background Ferroelectricity is found in materials with a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure and non-metallic binding, e.g.. perovskite structure-based ferroelectrics like PZT.. While fer-roelectric materials are piezoelectric as well, the unique feature of ferroelectric materi-als is their stable dielectric dipole.8,9This dipole is a result of different centers of neg-ative/positive charges within the unit-cell due to the position of the ions.. In PZT, this is induced by a small displacement of the central ion from the unit-cell center (see Fig.. 2.1), due to the non-centrosymmetric arrangement of the unit-cell.. Figure 2.1: Origin of polarization in perovskite-based ferroelectrics.. As shown here for PZT, the central Ti ion is displaced from the central position and induces a directional polarization depending on displacement direction.. 2.1 Behavior of ferroelectric materials By applying an electric field the dipole is stretched or compressed, which translates to the movement of e.g.. the central ion in perovskites, in order to counteract the induced electric field.. This is also called inverse piezoelectric effect.. However, in case of compression when reaching the so-called coercive field Ec, the central ion will move rapidly to a new position along the possible polarization axes, basically inverting the unit-cell, to accommodate for 3 the applied field.. Upon field removal, it will not return to the previous position but remain on its current side of the unit-cell.. The polarization (dipole state) present at zero field is called remanent polarization PR.. As depicted in Fig.. 2.2, the polarization response in dependence of the applied electric field forms a hysteresis..",536
Volltext (PDF).docx,Experiment,"al studies confirmed this as well with TC ranging from 250°C to 500°C depending on chemical composition and crystallographic orientation43–47.Figure 2.6: Common crystallographic phases in hafnium oxide and their corresponding total energy. Structures were relaxed via DFT calculations using projector augmented wave method and the total energy is extracted. More details on the DFT calculations are provided in the appendix. The lattice spacing along the axes are <100>=5.08Å for the cubic phase, [100]=[010]=5.08Å and [001]=5.23Å for the tetragonal phase, and [100]=5.15Å, [010]=5.20Å, 5.33Å, and β=80.3° for the monoclinic phase.In addition, multiple other orthorhombic phases have been reported which are in close vicinity to the ferroelectric one as well30,39,48–51. Most noteworthy is here the orthorhom-bic phase of space group Pbca, which can be described by two unit-cells of the ferroelectric phase aligned antipolar50. Consequently, this phase resembles an antiferroelectric struc-ture. Antiferroelectricity has been described by C. Kittel in 1951, and is defined as ordered arrangement of dipoles in an alternating way, resulting in a net zero polarization on the8outside52. Recent investigations on epitaxially grown films revealed an additional ferro-electric phase of rhombohedral (R3m) structure. This phase appears to be stabilized by epitaxial strain53–56and, like the other orthorhombic phases, is meta-stable thermody-namically.Figure 2.7: Schematic phase diagram of hafnium (zirconium) oxide in dependence of the grain size and temperature.57,58The white arrow indicates the most likely tran-sition to generate ferroelectric hafnium oxide.Consequently, kinetics need to be considered to explain the phase stabilization of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase. Early studies on ferroelectric HfO2 have used TiN cap-ping layers. It has been suggested that the capping layer is responsible for the stabilization of ferroelectric phase due to the suppression of the shear movement, which would be re-quired for the monoclinic phase.5In addition, DFT-based investigations have reported a high activation energy barrier for the phase transition from tetragonal to monoclinic, while the transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic exhibits a much lower barrier height59,60. Additional considerations of surface energies and grain size have proposed a phase di-agram (see Fig. 2.7), which contains the kinetically most favored transition into the fer-roelectric phase57,58. The crystallization process during annealing of ferroelectric HfO2 consequently can be described as follows57:i) Nucleation takes place via high symmetry phase, e.g. tetragonal.ii) Tetragonal crystallites are growing in size during the annealing and are prohibited to undergo a phase transition at high temperatures.iii) Upon cool-down the transition to monoclinic phase is kinetically suppressed, however, at TC, a transition to the orthorhombic phase takes place. The latter process has been suggested to be governed by nucleation and crystal growth as well, but has not been demonstrated",785
Volltext (PDF).docx,experiment,"ally57.9However, depending on the process conditions, some grains might transform to mon-oclinic phase if the activation energy barrier can be overcome. Nucleation studies in HfO2 have indicated that this phase can nucleate in the orthorhombic/tetragonal phase. More-over nucleation/growth of monoclinic grains cannot be excluded as well.61–63Figure 2.8: Ionic radii of doping elements in hafnium oxide films in comparison to Hf. Val-ues are taken from the work of R. D. Shannon64.Phase transition temperatures and thermodynamic-based energy levels can be, as men-tioned previously, influenced by a variety of process conditions. A major influence is the doping element and its concentration. A wide variety of dopants have been suggested or demonstrated to stabilize the ferroelectric phase. Most commonly Zr26,65,66, Si5,67–69, La70–73, Y47,74–76and Al77–79are used. However, also other dopants, like Sr, or Gd have been reported80–88. Zr is resembling a special case, since ZrO2 forms a solid solution with HfO2 26and ZrO2 can in principle based on DFT form a fluorite ferroelectric by itself30. Zr is therefore not a dopant in the classical definition even though it will be referred to as dopant throughout the manuscript. While Zr exhibits a very similar ionic radius as Hf (see Fig. 2.8), other dopants differ strongly64. Si and Al resemble smaller ions, whereas La and Y are larger.",364
Volltext (PDF).docx,Results,"from L. Xu et al. suggest that the concentration optimum is for all dopants identical if normalized84.In addition, dopants like Al, Y and La have a lower charge than Hf (see Fig. 2.8). Con-sequently, these dopants will introduce oxygen vacancies, which will further influence the phase stabilization and domain behavior of HfO2 as point defects89–97. However, their influence has not yet been understood in detail.Another contributing factor is the thickness of the HfO2 layer. Undoped HfO2 layers have been demonstrated to be ferroelectric for thin layers below 12 nm98, thus highlight-ing the importance of thickness engineering.69,98In addition, annealing conditions, e.g.temperature, will affect the final film composition as well.66,99–102102.2.2 Antiferroelectric-like behavior, wake-up effect, and fatigueFigure 2.9: Antiferroelectric-like behavior and the wake-up effect in hafnium oxide. The polarization hysteresis in hafnium oxide films behaves initially antiferroelectric-like, as schematically illustrated in (a), becoming more ferroelectric upon cy-cling. This visualizes itself by two peaks shifting towards each other with cy-cling until merging to a single peak in the displacement current, schematically shown in (b).After deposition and crystallization anneal, most ferroelectric hafnium oxide layers show strong changes in their behavior over electric field cycling. Often strong pinching or AFE-like behavior is observed initially (see Fig. 2.9a), which can be observed by peak splitting in the displacement current (see Fig. 2.9b). Upon cycling, these peaks shift towards each other and in most cases merge to a single peak, thus resulting in ferroelectric behavior. This is the so-called wake-up effect. However, films with very high doping concentrations have been demonstrated to show stable AFE-like behavior and do not show wake-up29. Fi-nally, at a certain number of cycles, breakdown/fatigue is observed. Many different trends have been observed here, like increased leakage103,104, hard breakdown32,105and reduc-tion in remanent polarization28,106–109.This cycling behavior is not understood in depth and many theories have been proposed especially for the wake-up effect and AFE-like behavior in hafnium oxide. These theories can be categorized into either phase-transitions, antiferroelectric or defect driven mech-anisms.Phase transitions were already suggested alongside the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide5. Most prominent is the field-induced transition from tetragonal to the orthorhombic phase. DFT simulations indicate that the tetragonal phase is stabilized for higher e.g. Zr concentrations, while Hf-rich films should consist of orthorhombic phase59. In addition, the two phases are energetically in close proximity30,59, and barrier heights of 35 meV per formula unit have been suggested59. In addition, this transition would be of first order, thus fitting to",685
Volltext (PDF).docx,experiment,"al observations110.. In consequence, this transition is likely also present during 180° domain wall switching based on DFT calculations.. While this 11 has been proposed to explain AFE-like behavior, the transition to ferroelectric behavior during wake-up requires a supporting mechanism, stabilizing the orthorhombic phase.. Here, defect redistribution/diffusion has been suggested to be responsible103,106,111,112.. The phase transition from monoclinic to orthorhombic phase has been suggested as well103.. Here again, defects, in this case oxygen vacancies, have been proposed to lower the activation barrier for this transition111.. However, this transition appears to be highly unlikely and permanent wake-up cannot be explained easily, since the monoclinic phase resembles the thermodynamical ground state and a transition to orthorhombic phase would move to a metastable phase.. Another explanation are antiferroelectric/antipolar phases.. The proposed phases by DFT are of orthorhombic nature, and the most promising candidate is the phase of space-group Pbca.. This phase is basically described by two ferroelectric unit-cells of spacegroup Pca21 in antipolar alignment next to each other.50,113,114As a result, this also implies that domain walls in hafnium oxide should be very thin, which was recently confirmed by DFT, suggesting a domain wall width of half a unit-cell115.. This is in strong contrast to perovskite ferroelectrics, which normally exhibit extended Ising walls.. The antipolar Pbca phase is in close thermodynamic proximity to the ferroelectric phase as well, and has therefore been suggested to explain the observed AFE-like behavior.. Phase stabilization during wake-up has been related to defect redistribution or tensile stress increase50.. Other antipolar phases, which have been proposed, are of spacegroup Pnma.. While there is evidence for the presence of this phase in polycrystalline hafnium oxide films, their phase fraction is insignificant and it was therefore concluded that they are most likely not the dominating mechanism during wake-up48.. Finally, the presence of defects has been suggested as an origin for AFE-like behavior.. These range from point defects like oxygen vacancies68,71to extended defects like dead layer effects31.. The former could be responsible for domain wall pinning68,71or local in-ternal bias fields, e.g.. by being located at the interface of to the electrode68,112..",529

Schematic illustration of a FeFET in an intermediate state due to differently polarized domains is presented in (a). That a large number of possible inter-mediate states visualizes itself in different threshold voltage (Vt) states (b).The aforementioned pulse sequences can directly be used to operate the FeFET in a multi-bit fashion, thus resembling a synapse storing a weight value analogue to synapses in the brain (see Fig. 2.11)145,146. These synaptic devices can then be used in convolutional neural network (CNN), simplifying the implementation of matrix multiplication strongly141,156. On the other hand, devices can be operated as neurons, where time plasticity is of major importance, as used e.g. in spiking neural network (SNN)156–160. For neuron operation, e.g. accumulative switching can utilized to implement an integrate-and-fire operation154.In order to achieve high accuracy in CNNs, linear behavior for the current states over the applied pulses, as well as a high dynamic range and low variability is of importance161–163. How this can be achieved in FeFETs, is shown in section 6.2. However, this is strongly influenced by the physics of hafnium oxide (chapter 6), the microstructure of the thin film (chapter 5) as well as the FeFET device structure and design (chapter 6).163 MethodologyThe characterization of ultra thin ferroelectric and polycrystalline hafnium oxide films is quite challenging, as many methods used commonly for the characterization of perovskite ferroelectrics are operating close to their resolution limit. In the following sections, possi-bilities for electrical and structural characterization of hafnium oxide layers are presented. Here, a novel characterization method called TKD [also known as transmission electron backscattering diffraction (t-EBSD)] is explained in detail, which enabled many new insights into the mechanisms present in hafnium oxide thin films.3.1 Electrical analysisThe electrical characterization basically may be grouped in characterization of capacitors and FeFET devices. Characterization of the former allows to extract material parameters, whereas characterization of the latter is important to understand the device behavior and reliability.3.1.1 CapacitorsFor the characterization of capacitors, an Aixacct TF3000 Analyzer is utilized. The polar-ization is measured here via a virtual ground setup (see Fig. 3.1a). Dynamic hysteresis measurement (DHM)s are performed to obtain polarization hystereses and displacement current curves. Therefore, this method allows the extraction of the remanent polarization PR, saturation polarization PS and coercive field EC (see Fig. 2.2). Further analysis of the displacement current allows to identify peak splitting (AFE-like behavior), which can also be estimated from the PR/PS ratio. Differences in the EC values quantify imprint in addi-tion. More details on the analysis of DHMs can be found in the work of T. Schenk et al.164. If not specified, the measurements are performed at a frequency of 1 kHz.17Figure 3.1: Measurement setup for dynamic hysteresis and retention measurements on ferroelectric capacitors. The virtual ground method (a) is used for measuring the polarization. Here, an external voltage (Vext is applied, and the field across the ferroelectric (VFE) and field VR across the reference resistor (Rref) are mea-sured. The latter is proportional to the change of polarization over time.164For the retention measurement a XPUND pulse train as depicted in (b) is applied after a defined time past the initial write pulse. From the resulting polarization hysteresis (c) the parameters Prrel+, Prrel- and PX can be extracted, which are required for the calculation of the retention loss.Applying electric field cycling in between DHMs enables the analysis of wake-up and fa-tigue. Here, changes in the shape of the displacement current and polarization hysteresis can be tracked as well as the evolution of the aforementioned figures of merit.To separate leakage and polarization, a positive-up-negative-down (PUND) measure-ment can be performed. Here, a second triangular pulse is performed after each of the two triangular pulses during DHM. For ferroelectric behavior, the second pulse only records dielectric and leakage contributions and therefore allows to extract the polariza-tion induced by switching. This method can also be used to study retention in metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) and metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MFIS) capaci-tors. By adding an additional pulse, the polarization after a certain time can be compared to the full switchable polarization (see Fig. 3.1c). Using equation 3.1 and 3.2 the relative polarization loss the positive and negative state can be extracted, respectively. Prrel+ and Prrel- represent the relative PR values extracted after the PX measurement (see Fig. 3.1c).P+ Prrel+ – PX (3.1)loss= 1 –Prrel+ – Prrel–In order to extract the Preisach density, which can be very helpful to investigate the loss= – Prrel– – PX Prrel+ – Prrel–P–(3.2)nature of the switching process, first-order-reversal-curve (FORC) measurements can be conducted. Here, multiple triangular pulses, starting from the minimum value, are applied with an amplitude up to a maximum amplitude of a reverse bias, which has the same range as a full DHM cycle. By taking the derivative in respect to the bias and reverse bias electric18field, the switching density can be visualized. More details on this method can be found elsewhere164–166.In order to probe the relative permittivity of the layer, capacitance-voltage (CV) mea-surements can be performed. Here, switching",1359
Volltext (PDF).docx,results,"in a so-called butterfly curve, where the peaks correspond to the switching events and the capacitance converges at higher amplitudes to the dielectric capacitance, allowing to extract the relative permittivity.. In case of MFIS stacks however, this behavior is convoluted with the non-linear behavior of the semiconductor and capacitance of the insulating layer.. In consequence, this stack configuration does not allow to extract the exact capacitance value of the hafnium oxide layer.. 3.1.2 FeFETs As for MFIS capacitors, the same CV behavior applies for FeFETs.. In order to measure CV, the drain and source need to be connected to ground as well.. To directly observe the impact of the ferroelectric polarization on the transistor channel, transfer character-istics (IDVG curves) can visualize the MW directly by extracting the threshold voltage Vt at a defined current criteria (see Fig.. 3.2) Figure 3.2: Extraction of threshold voltage and memory window (MW) from the transfer-characteristics of FeFETs.. Here, a current criteria of 10–8A is used.. In addition, the switching behavior can be probed by program or erase characteristics.. Here, the switching behavior is tested by setting the FeFET into a reference state and applying a program/erase pulse and subsequent IDVG.. This is repeated with different am-plitude or pulse width and the shift in Vt can be identified.. When varying amplitude and width, the resulting two dimensional graph is referred to as shmoo plot.. In analogy to the capacitors, the IDVG curves can be recorded after field cycling or waiting time to investigate endurance or retention, respectively.. In case of retention, this has 19 also the advantage, that the readout is non-destructive, requiring no rewrite after each individual measurement, as compared to MFM and MFIS capacitors.. 3.2 Structural and chemical analysis Besides electrical characterization, structural characterization of the crystallographic prop-erties like phase composition and texture are of major importance to understand the elec-trical behavior on microscopic level.. Especially useful methods are grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and time-of-flight secondary-ion-mass-spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), which are presented in the following sections.. TKD, which enables the local resolution of crystallographic properties and microstructure is presented in section 3.3..",528
Volltext (PDF).docx,discussion,"on the discovery of a novel kind of wake-up in amorphous films, which has been identified as an electric-field induced crystallization.4.1 Ferroelastic switchingClassical AFE-like wake-up behavior is described by a initially AFE-like hysteresis with two symmetric current peaks in each direction. Upon cycling a transition to a single symmetric current peak is observed, resulting in ferroelectric behavior (see Fig. 4.1a). As discussed in section 2.2.2 before, most of the proposed mechanisms require diffusion/drift processes. In order to investigate this, e.g. the activation energy barrier, temperature and frequency dependent cycling measurements were performed on a HZO sample annealed at 400°C and 450°C.The frequency dependent measurements (see Fig. 4.1b) reveal surprisingly that the wake-up process is strongly dependent on the number of cycles and not on the cycling time, contradicting diffusion/drift processes171. This can be deduced from the coinciding increase in remanent polarization for different frequencies. The decrease in PR for higher cycle numbers is associated with fatigue. In addition, the temperature dependent mea-surements reveal that the pristine behavior differs depending on the operation tempera-ture (see Fig. 4.1c), behaving more ferroelectric for lower temperatures and more AFE-like for higher. Upon cycling, a complete transition to ferroelectric behavior is observed. For higher Zr concentration, it can be further observed that for higher temperatures the peaks are separated further and upon cycling no transition to fully ferroelectric behavior can be achieved.171 In consequence, the wake-up mechanism does not follow an Arrhenius behavior nor is it explainable by changes in the crystallographic phase or position of defects as the25Figure 4.1: Electrical behavior of classical AFE-like wake-up. A HZO sample deposited at 250°C and annealed at 800°C shows transition from AFE-like behavior to fer-roelectric behavior upon cycling (a). Analysis of a HZO sample with AFE-like wake-up annealed at 400°C shows a strong dependence on the number of cycles to reach ferroelectric behavior (b). Pristine response of a HZO sample annealed at 450°C shows increasing AFE-like behavior with increasing anneal-ing temperature (c). Figures reproduced with permission from ref. 171 Wiley.behavior is already modified in pristine condition for small temperature changes. This has strong implications on the underlying mechanism. First, domain wall pinning and internal bias fields cannot explain the observed behavior, as there appears to be no diffusion/drift processes which would result in a defect redistribution. While one could argue that these diffusion/drift processes take only place during the switching process and will therefore be dependent on the number of cycles, the opposing temperature dependence still excludes those processes.Second, transitions from the monoclinic to the orthorhombic phase cannot be sup-ported by oxygen vacancy redistribution as well as they are further energetically unfa-vorable30,172, as discussed previously, and do not agree with the low monoclinic phase fractions observed in samples with AFE-like wake-up like shown in e.g. Fig. 3.3f5,26,107,168.Third, while first-order transitions can explain an increased AFE-like behavior with tem-perature, a transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase responsible for AFE-like behavior would still require an orthorhombic phase stabilization by e.g. defect redistri-bution103,106. This, however, is not observed. Moreover, recent",805
Volltext (PDF).docx,results,"suggest that this phase transition is irreversible at these temperatures173,174, which is expected due to the much higher Curie temperature in the range of 250°C to 500°C44,45,47,101,175. Other simulations trying to fit the AFE-like behavior to this phase transition also found the re-quirement of a much lower Curie temperature176.Further evidence for this is provided by displacement measurements of 20 nm HSO films annealed at 650°C177. Here, only positive displacement is observed for AFE-like be-havior (4.8 cat.% and 5.6 cat.% Si-doping), whereas ferroelectric behavior (2.7 cat.% Si-doping)",155
Volltext (PDF).docx,results,"in a butterfly-shaped curve with positive and negative contributions. In consequence, this further disagrees with domain wall depinning and internal bias fields, which fail to explain such a behavior. Moreover, the observed displacements of more than2660 pm exceed the expected value for even monocrystalline layers undergoing a tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition of 40 pm177, which is based on the unit-cell dimensions in Fig. 2.5 and 2.6. In addition, an increase in the relative permittivity is observed for these samples of 14% to 30% after wake-up. This contradicts a transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase as well, since this would result in a relative permittivity decrease, as the orthorhombic phase is of lower symmetry. The only sample where this increase is not observed is the one with a 2.7 cat.%, which is not AFE-like initially.177Figure 4.2: TKD analysis pre/post cycling. IPF maps of a HSO sample (TEMAHf and 3DMAS precursors) with a thickness of 10 nm annealed at 650°C show a strong out-of-plane texture of the [010] axis prior to cycling (a). Post cycling, increase in out-of-plane orientation of the [001] axis is observed. The difference in the ODF for pre and post cycling analysis shows a clear switching process of the [010]- and [001]-axes (b). Polarization hysteresis pre and post cycling is given in (c). Figures reproduced with permission from ref. 171 Wiley.In order to gain more insights on microscopic level, TKD measurements are conducted on pristine and cycled (2*106cylces at 3 V) samples. The pristine sample shows a strong out-of-plane texture of the [010]-axis, which is non-polar (see Fig. 4.2a). The polariza-tion axis, however, is mostly lying in-plane. This is in strong disagreement with expecta-tions for the antipolar Pbca phase, which is described by two unit-cells of the polar Pca21 phase50,178. Consequently, it should result in an out-of-plane orientation of the [001]/po-larization axis, since the large polarization values and displacement",506
Volltext (PDF).docx,results,"are else not explainable. In case of tetragonal phase fitted wrongly with orthorhombic phase on the other hand, an almost equal distribution between the [010] and [001] axis would be ex-pected, as they are symmetrical equivalents in this phase. This however is not observed as well.After cycling however, a reorientation of the [010]/[001]-axes is observed, switching the two axes, thus resulting in an out-of-plane orientation of the polarization axis (see Fig. 4.2b). This is very similar to observations in epitaxial films, which observed a reorientation of the [001]-axis to the out-of-plane as well47,118. While there is still in-plane orientation of the polarization present, it still matches nicely to the",173
Volltext (PDF).docx,results,"of this sample (see Fig. 4.2c), which still has AFE-like contributions post cycling.17127This raises the question on the underlying mechanism, as all previously discussed ef-fects are unable to explain or in contradiction to the sum of observations above. Based on the observed reorientation, 90° domain wall movement is most likely present in or-thorhombic hafnium oxide layers. Since ferroelectric hafnium oxide is commonly explored in thin films with a thickness in the approximate range of 1 nm to 50 nm, residual me-chanical stress resulting from thermal expansion mismatch is likely to be present and it has been suggested to be of tensile nature179,180. Since 90° domain wall movement is identical to ferroelastic switching in this unit-cell symmetry46, a stress driven switching process is quite likely to take place. More precisely, in a (in-plane) tensile stressed film, the longer axes will align in-plane, in this case the [100]- and [001]-axis with a length of 5.27 Å and 5.08 Å, respectively. Applying an electric field, the polarization axis ([001]) is favored to switch to the out-of-plane direction. However, upon field removal, the out-of-plane configuration of the [001]-axis becomes unfavorable in points of mechanical stress and a reorientation to the in-plane should take place, resulting again in the shortest axis ([010]-axis) with a length of 5.05 Å pointing in out-of-plane direction. The resulting behav-ior would be, in consequence, AFE-like (see Fig. 4.3a).171Figure 4.3: Ferroelastic switching process in hafnium oxide.

Figure (a) reproduced with permission from ref. 171 Wiley.The stabilization of the out-of-plane orientation of the polarization axis can then be eas-ily explained by stress relaxation. This is most likely induced by defect generation of e.g. dislocations, which is expected for such strong displacements. As the switching process induces stress spikes due to the extended ion movement and therefore displacement, dislocations are likely to form at this instance and the behavior shows therefore a depen-dence on the cycle number. In consequence, the behavior shift from an in-plane domain configuration governed by a first-order transition, namely ferroelastic switching, to an out-of-plane configuration governed by ferroelectric switching (180° domain wall movement) which behaves like a first-order transition far below TC (see Fig. 4.3b). Reflecting on the28observed effects above, it can be deduced that this mechanism would be able to explain the behavior. First, the cycle dependence is fitting well, since no diffusion/drift processes are required and the defect generation should be related to the number of times reorien-tation/displacement takes place. Second, temperature driven AFE-like behavior is easily explainable by changes in the local stress level even in pristine condition due to thermal expansion mismatch. Third, the observed displacement matches nicely to the expected displacement of 80-120 pm for ferroelastic switching in monocrystalline material based on the values from30and Fig.2.5, respectively177. The observed permittivity increase fits very well with the predicted change of 17.9% based on the anisotropic permittivity tensor under 90° reorientation30. Fourth, the observed in-plane orientation in pristine case as well as the reorientation after cycling observed by TKD are explainable.171,177The ferroelastic switching based AFE-like behavior can be modeled by considering first a simplified model for ferroelectric switching based on the tanh-function (equ. 4.1)125.While this considers 180° domain switching, in case of ferroelastic switching this is split PFE = PS ∗ tanh�E ± EC∗ log�PS + PR��(4.1)into two processes, switching 90° from out-of-plane to in-plane and vice versa. These tran-sitions are further affected by the mechanical stress σ, affecting the effective field for each transition (Eeff,1, Eeff,2). While tensile stress makes the transition to the in-plane orientation easier (equ. 4.2), the transition to the out-of-plane orientation is suppressed (equ. 4.3). Since the impact of stress and electric field might differ between the two processes, an additional coupling constant c is introduced.181Eeff,1 = Eext ∓ f(σ) (4.2)The summation of these two transition processes can be written as given in equation Eeff,2 = c ∗ Eext ± f(σ) (4.3)4.4. The resulting behavior fits well to the observed AFE-like behavior (see Fig. 4.4)181and agrees with the behavior expected for first-order transitions110.Based on this model, the influence of mechanical stress f(σ) can be investigated in more PAFE = 0.5 ∗�PFE(Eeff,1) + PS ∗ tanh�Eeff,2 ∓ EC∗ log�PS + PR���(4.4)detail as well, as it allows to model the electrical behavior of devices utilizing ferroelasticswitching.In summary, previous theories on the physical origin of wake-up, like the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition, fail to explain the observed frequency and temperature dependent behavior as well as permittivity and displacement investigations. Therefore,29Figure 4.4: Mathematical model of ferroelastic switching. Polarization hysteresis (a) and depolarization current (b) show pinching/AFE-like behavior and peak splitting with increasing stress, respectively. Coupling constant c is set to 0.7. Figures reproduced with permission from ref. 181 Springer.a new theory based on 90° domain wall movement (ferroelastic switching) is proposed, which is able to explain the observed behavior and was confirmed by structural investiga-tion prior and post wake-up. A simplified model for this first-order switching process has been given alongside.4.2 Electric field-induced crystallizationWhile investigating the wake-up behavior in hafnium oxide, an unusual behavior was dis-covered for amorphous films: Applying larger voltage amplitudes resulted in an emer-gence of ferroelectric behavior (see Fig. 4.5a).171This phenomenological sudden wake-up is not expected, as ferroelectric behavior requires a non-centrosymmetric unit-cell and therefore crystalline structures. Moreover, the achieved 2PR of 47 μC/cm2exceeds even values commonly observed for fully crystalline films.171To gain insight on the nature of this effect, temperature and time dependent measure-ments are conducted. In stark contrast to the classical AFE-like wake-up (see Fig. 4.1b), the sudden wake-up shows purely time-dependence (see Fig. 4.5b). This visualizes itself by coinciding remanent polarization curves for a large range of applied frequencies in time domain. Moreover, this process is accelerated with temperature and shows therefore Ar-rhenius behavior. Here, the temperature dependent time to reach a defined polarization value is extracted from the wake-up measurements performed at different temperatures. From the Arrhenius plot (Fig. 4.5c) an effective activation energy of 0.45 eV can be ex-tracted. The actual value, however, might differ slightly, since pyroelectric contributions and pinching due to ferroelastic switching with increased temperature alter the PR values. This value is further lower than the activation energies observed for phase-change mate-30Figure 4.5: Electrical characterization of sudden wake-up. Electric field cycling at high am-plitude",1400

Nevertheless, it can be concluded that this process is most likely driven by diffusion/drift mechanisms.171 Consequently, this suggests an electric-field driven crystallization, as depicted in Fig. 4.6a, of the initially X-ray amorphous film. TEM analysis of a cycled device reveals a crys-talline structure as well (see Fig. 4.6b). Analysis on additional as-deposited material further suggests that small nuclei are required to be present in order to enable this crystallization mechanism, as electric field-induced crystallization is not achievable in the as-deposited device171. The crystallization process itself is then most likely driven by electric field in-duced diffusion/drift of ions enabling the crystal growth of the nuclei.171 Additional CV analysis (see Fig. 4.6c) reveals a strong increase of the relative permittivity, resulting in values similar to fully crystalline films. Such a strong increase is expected for a transition from amorphous to crystalline layers. For fully crystalline layers on the other hand, no significant change in permittivity is observed via CV. The change in the CV curve shape can be associated with the AFE-like wake-up induced changes in the domain structure of the film transitioning to out-of-plane orientation.The field-induced crystallization can also be controlled precisely, allowing to program different degrees of crystallinity. As shown in Fig. 4.6d, cycling with increased amplitude up to a defined time crystallizes the sample. A reduction of cycling amplitude, however, suppresses this mechanism. Consequently, the device can be operated like other ferro-electric films at a defined degree of crystallinity.In summary, a novel effect in hafnium oxide was discovered that is described by an electric field-induced crystallization. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this process is highly controllable, allowing to achieve defined levels of crystallinity, as well as to operate in semi-crystalline condition without further crystallization.31Figure 4.6: Electric field-induced crystallization in hafnium oxide. Crystallization process is schematically portrayed in (a). TEM analysis (b) of 5 nm 1:1 HZO film annealed at 400°C confirms crystallinity post cycling.

Figures reproduced with permission from ref. 182 Nature.This novel mechanism therefore enables the development of novel device conceptsas well as integration flows, where the devices can be defined post-processing. Possibleapplication fields are e.g. co-integration of dielectric and ferroelectric hafnium oxide basedcapacitors in the BEoL, neural networks or secure integrated circuits.325 Microstructure engineeringWhile the former chapter has focused on the physical mechanisms present at atomic level, the polycrystalline nature of ferroelectric hafnium oxide needs to be considered for device applications. Since TKD enables a detailed analysis of the local crystallographic structure, it is utilized in conjunction with electrical measurements to identify influences on the mi-crostructure resulting from the processing and adjacent layers. First, the domain structure in hafnium oxide is investigated, followed by an analysis of doping, annealing, interlayer and substrate influences. In addition, more evidence supporting the previously discussed mechanisms, namely ferroelastic switching and electric field-induced crystallization, will be given alongside.5.1 Microstructure and ferroelectric domains in HfO2As mentioned previously in section 2.1.2, domains of different polarization direction are separated by domain walls. Recent DFT calculations have indicated that 180° domain walls can be as small as half a unit-cell in hafnium oxide115. This is remarkable, as common per-ovskite materials have extended domain walls spanning multiple unit-cells115. Additional DFT calculations reveal similarly small domain walls for other polarization relations (see Fig. 5.1a)185. While the 180° domain wall (up-down) has the unusual behavior showing flat phonon bands115, the 90° domain walls are exhibiting a Bloch wall and the charged 180° domain wall (right-left) behaves like an Ising wall. These domain walls are also larger in size with one unit-cell for 90° domain walls and one and a half unit-cells for the charged 180° domain wall. Nevertheless, all domain walls in hafnium oxide are much smaller com-pared to the domain walls in common perovskite materials. In consequence, a very fine structured domain structure could be present in HfO2 layers.Due to the polycrystalline nature, the domain structure of the material will be further intersected by grain boundaries. While the polarity might extend over a grain boundary33Figure 5.1: Domain structure in hafnium oxide based on DFT calculations and TKD mea-surements. DFT calculations (a) predict domain walls in the size of 0.5 to 1.5 unit-cells depending on the type of domain wall. TKD measurements reveal a predominant orthorhombic microstructure (b), with high levels of intragranu-lar misorientation (c). High resolution images (d) of grains provide evidence for intragranualar 90° domain structure.for a collective domain, the individual domains will end at a grain boundary due to the significant change in crystallographic orientation.Analyzing the microstructure of a HSO film with larger grains, a dendritic grain structure is observed (see Fig. 5.1b). Still, most grains fit to the orthorhombic Pca21 phase. Under the assumption of a simplified cubic symmetry, strong misorientation is revealed, which can be deduced from the color gradient in the IPF map (see Fig. 5.1c). Such misorien-tation is often closely related to mechanical stress fields and increased defect levels to accommodate the lattice distortions. Since ferroelastic switching is closely linked to me-chanical stress levels, a 90° domain structure is likely to form here. This can actually be observed via TKD in Fig. 5.1d, where regions with [001] or [010] out-of-plane orientation are present, respectively. As these regions can be found co-existing inside single grains, a presence of 90° domain walls can be deduced. Due to the small nature of these domain walls however, they are not structurally observable here, as they are below the resolution limit. Consequently, besides those larger regions, smaller domains might exist inside the grains as well.The here presented direct evidence of in-plane domains ([010]-axis oriented out-of-plane), is therefore in agreement with ferroelastic switching, whereas such domains are not explainable by the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition.5.2 Doping influencesA major factor affecting the phase stabilization as well as the electric behavior is the doping element and its concentration51,84,186–190. The doping elements can be grouped in three large groups: i) smaller ionic radius, ii) similar ionic radius, and iii) larger ionic radius. For34each group, a common doping element is investigated, namely Si, Zr and La, respectively. Additionally, co-doping with different elements is explored to investigate the contribution of oxygen vacancies and dopant related effects. In the context of device integration, the aforementioned dopants also resemble the FEoL and BEoL integration of doped HfO2 with Si and Zr, respectively.5.2.1 Zr doping (similar ionic radius)Since Zr doping is commonly investigated for the BEoL integration of FeRAM, FeFET or ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) technology34,129,191–194, the doping behavior is explored close to the crystallization temperature, which is around 350°C for 10 nm films23,33,35. While this temperature is suitable for BEoL conditions, annealing time is known to play a major role for many crystallization processes and therefore the much longer furnace anneal present in BEoL integration flows might result in different",1276

For the analysis of the impact on the microstructure, TKD is employed on these two samples. Based on the overlayed phase and quality map of the furnace annealed sample (see Fig. 5.2a), a pre-dominant orthorhombic phase composition consisting of very small disc-shaped grains can be deduced.195Figure 5.2: Transmission Kikuchi diffraction of a furnace annealed HZO film. The film was annealed for 1 h at 400°C. Small orthorhombic grains are observed in the phase map, overlayed with the quality map (a). Differences in in-plane (b) and out-of-plane (c) IPF indicate the presence of a crystallographic texture. Figures reproduced with permission from ref. 195 IEEE.35IPF maps (see Fig. 5.2b and 5.2c) further show a pronounced [010] out-of-plane texture. The [100]- and [001]-axis are randomly oriented in-plane. Nevertheless, larger amounts of grains with [100] out-of-plane orientation as well as a few with [001] are present too. In consequence, the crystallographic texture in out-of-plane direction appears to be closely linked to the <100>-axes. This can also nicely be seen in the PFs (see Fig. 5.2d). Here, the three axes all show a peak in the ODF at the out-of-plane direction and an increas-ing circular shaped signal is observed in the ODF close to the in-plane direction for the [010]- and [001]-axis. However, no significant orientation density is observed for tilted directions. Here, the [110]-axis appears to be dominant, as indicated by the ""doughnut"" shaped ODF.195Figure 5.3: Structural comparison of RTA and furnace annealed HZO. Both films are an-nealed at 400°C, with an annealing time of 60 s and 1 h, respectively. Quality maps (a) do not show a significant difference in grain size. The IPF of the RTA sample (b) shows a similar crystallographic texture as the furnace annealed sample (see Fig. 5.2d). Figures reproduced with permission from ref. 195 IEEE.Comparing now with the RTA sample, no significant difference in grain size and shape is observed (see Fig. 5.3a).195This is quite remarkable, as the furnace anneal is much longer and therefore larger grains would have been expected. In addition, the ODF of the RTA sample is similar to the furnace one as well, as shown by the IPF in Fig. 5.3b. Here, an increased out-of-plane orientation density is observed in descending order for the [100]-, [010]- and [001]- axis analogue to the furnace annealed sample. Consequently, it can be concluded that the annealing time has no significant influence on the microstructure of hafnium oxide.195All subsequent analysis of Zr doping of crystalline samples annealed via RTA should therefore be transferable to BEoL integrated layers.Influence of the doping concentration in crystalline filmsFor increasing Zr doping concentrations, a transition from a mostly dielectric behavior with small ferroelectric contributions to a pronounced ferroelectric behavior can be observed in the polarization response (see Fig. 5.4). After a Hf:Zr ratio of 1:1, the behavior then shifts to an increasingly AFE-like response for higher Zr concentrations. Moreover, PS reduces. Similar behavior has been reported previously as well26,32,196–199.36Figure 5.4: Polarization hystereses of HZO films annealed at 450°C (60 s) with different doping concentration. Increasing AFE-like behavior is observed for higher dop-ing concentrations, whereas a decrease in remanent polarization is observable for Hf-rich layer. Highest polarization values are reached fro 1:1 cycling ratio. Figure reproduced with permission from ref. 195 IEEE.The phase and quality map obtained by TKD (see Fig. 5.5a) provides evidence of in-creasing monoclinic phase with lower Zr doping. In addition, an increase of grain size is observable. The increasing amount of monoclinic phase for Hf-rich layers agrees well with the recorded GIXRD patterns (see Fig. 5.5b). Here, the two lines at 28° and 32° associated with the monoclinic phase show increasing intensity with decreasing amount of Zr.195 From the extracted IPFs for orthorhombic phase (see Fig. 5.5c) further trends with dop-ing can be deduced. First, an increase with Zr-content in out-of-plane texture for the [100]-axis is observable. Such behavior should result in a decrease of PR and PS. While this matches to the observed decrease for high Zr-content, it does not explain the AFE-like nature and the 2PR maximum for 1:1 ratio.195 Second, the AFE-like behavior has been related to residual tensile stress and out-of-plane orientation of the [010]-axis before. While TKD does not allow the extraction of global stress levels, a [010] out-of-plane texture can be observed for all samples. How-ever, a decrease with increasing Zr-content is observed here.195While this might appear contradictory at first, the increase in [001] out-of-plane orientation for the Hf-rich sample, suggest a decrease in tensile stress with higher Hf-content. In addition, the overall crys-tallographic texture appears to be most pronounced for the 1:1 ratio, as can be deduced from the higher ODF values and smaller peak regions in the IPF.195 In",1338
Volltext (PDF).docx,conclusion,", the sum of all observed trends matches to the electrical behavior: In-creased monoclinic phase explains the reduced PR and PS for increasing Hf-content. The less pronounced wake-up here fits well to the increase in [001] orientation density. Higher Zr-content on the other hand is leading to an increased presence of [100]-axis, most likely a result of the modified crystallization temperature, and reduced [001] out-of-plane ori-entation, most likely accompanied with increased tensile stress. This would result in de-creased PR and PS as well as increased AFE-like behavior, which, in especially strong cases, might result in further reduction of polarization values. The 1:1 ratio therefore resembles the optimum condition, showing the most pronounced texture and a good trade-off be-37Figure 5.5: TKD and GIXRD analysis of HZO films annealed at 450°C (60 s) with different doping concentration. The phase maps, overlayed with the quality maps, (a) indicate increasing monoclinic phase for the Hf-rich layer. This behavior is con-firmed by the patterns obtained from GIXRD (b) as well. IPFs of those films pro-vide evidence that the [100] out-of-plane orientation density increases with Zr-doping. Figures reproduced with permission from ref. 195 IEEE.tween monoclinic phase, increased [100]-axis and tensile stress.195Nevertheless, the low temperature anneal does not reach PR and PS values observed for the sample annealed at 800°C, which is discussed later in comparison to Si-doping in FEoL conditions, as less [100]-axis out-of-plane orientation is present at this temperature.In summary, the structural origin for the Zr-doping dependent behavior in HZO layers was investigated. The presence of a pronounced crystallographic texture is observed in all samples, showing a [100] and [010] out-of-plane texture. Further changes in the mon-oclinic phase fraction as well as a decrease in grain size for higher Zr-content is observed. The found changes in the crystallographic texture in dependence of the doping level could be related to the observed changes in electric behavior.Doping dependent amorphous-crystalline phase boundary in HZOA reduction of the film thickness has been reported to shift the crystallization tempera-ture to higher values32,200. As a result, the Hf-rich films with a thickness of 5 nm do not crystallize at an annealing temperature of 450°C by RTA. This can be observed nicely in the GIXRD patterns (see Fig. 5.6).

In consequence, the crystallization temperature is shifted by the Zr-doping from slightly above 450°C to values below.182Figure 5.6: GIXRD patterns of 5 nm films annealed at 450°C with varying Zr content. X-ray amorphous behavior is observed for Hf-rich films. Figure reproduced with permission from ref. 182 Nature.As a result, the amorphous Hf-rich sample exhibits electric field-induced crystallization, whereas the crystalline Zr-rich sample shows classical AFE-like wake-up (see Fig. 4.1a). The doping variation therefore allows to probe the transition between these two effects nicely. From the displacement current over cycling, first observations can be made (see Fig. 5.7a): i) The integrated area of the displacement current peaks in case of the fully crystalline samples stays constant over wake-up. ii) In case of the amorphous sample, a displacement current peak emerges and growth in intensity over cycling. ii) For semi-crystalline sample with higher Zr-content, initially peak splitting is observed. Upon cycling they merge and increase in intensity.182 For a deeper insight into the switching behavior of these samples, Preisach densities are extracted from FORC measurements (see Fig. 5.7b). In pristine condition, no peak is observable for the amorphous sample, indicating no significant ferroelectric contribution. Upon increasing the Zr-content, first a faint single peak emerges.

A transition from sudden wake-up to classical AFE-like wake-up is observed with increasing Zr-content in the measured displacement current (a).

Volltext (PDF).docx,results,"indicate that this difference is linked to changes in the crystallization temperature as well. While the amorphous layer can compensate for tensile stress more easily, the earlier crystallized layer is hindered by its crystalline struc-ture to reduce stress resulting from thermal expansion mismatch.182Figure 5.8: Approximate phase diagram of the phase boundary between amorphous and crystalline HZO in dependence of Zr-content and cycling time/number. Here, PS is correlated to the degree of crystallinity, but may contain artifacts due to crystallographic texture differences, and the peak shift compared to the ferro-electric coercive field resembles the degree of AFE-like behavior. The former is time dependent, whereas the latter is dependent on the cycle number. Figure reproduced with permission from ref. 182 Nature.Upon cycling, the amorphous or semi-crystalline films crystallize further and an increase in peak intensity is observable. Moreover, an inwards shift of the peaks is observed, re-sulting in fully merged peaks and therefore ferroelectric behavior for all samples up to a Hf:Zr cycling ratio of 1:1. For higher Zr-content, the peaks do not merge, however, an in-ward shift is still present, enabling a transition to pinched behavior for the 3:5 Hf:Zr cycling ratio sample. Based on the previous discussed mechanisms, this allows to make conclu-sions on the possible domain structure responsible for this behavior. While amorphous regions decrease with higher Zr concentrations, the domain structure transits from a out-of-plane to an in-plane arrangement. Furthermore, cycling allows to reduce amorphous regions and supports the formation of out-of-plane domains.182This is also summarized by plotting the PS value over cycling and Zr-content, as this correlates with the crystalline fraction, and by plotting the peak shift of the displacement current (|Ec,AFE-Ec,FE|), corre-lating with the degree of AFE-like behavior. The resulting graph therefore resembles an approximate phase diagram (see Fig. 5.8). However, artifacts resulting from differences in crystallographic texture might be present alongside. The drop in polarization for higher cycling numbers in the Zr-rich samples is due to breakdown.182This raises the question on the reliability of films crystallized thermally or by electric field.41Figure 5.9: Reliability investigation of HZO samples showing sudden and classical wake-up. Endurance characteristics with electric cycling at 1 kHz and an amplitude of 2.3 V for 2PR (a) and 2PS (b) shows a leakage driven breakdown for the Zr-rich sample, which is described by drastic increase in PR and a decrease in PS. The high leakage can be observed as well in the displacement current (c) after 3.98*104cycles. Cycling at a lower frequency of 20 Hz at the identical ampli-tude allows field-induced crystallization to take place, which can be identified by an increase in PR (d) and PS (e).

Furthermore, stable retention is observed (see Fig 5.9f).. Since the two processes, electric field-induced crystallization and ferroelastic switching-mediated wake-up, are dependent on the cycling time and number, respectively, it further enables to tune the phase diagram to achieve the desired polarization response.. There-fore, this phase diagram can be utilized to optimize the properties of the hafnium oxide 42 layer for its application in e.g.. BEoL non-volatile memory applications, circuit security or neuromorphic computing.. In summary, the amorphous-crystalline phase boundary can be controlled by the Zr doping..

From this data it can be inferred that the aforementioned45Figure 5.12: Angular orientation density compared for HZO and HSO films. For HZO, a broader distribution is observed for all three axes as shown in (a) to (c), re-spectively.

This fits well to the increased {200} signal in the is therefore quite likely to be related to crystallographic texture which might be induced by semi-epitaxial growth, as the orientation distribution is very narrow.205The behavior is therefore not referred to as classical (AFE-like) wake-up, but rather textured wake-up. More insight on the microstructural origin of this phenomenological wake-up behavior is given in section 5.3, which will focus on the crystallization process during annealing. Fur-thermore the influence of the different behavior of HSO and HZO microstructure on the reliability of FeFET applications is given in section 6.1.In summary, Si-doped hafnium oxide layers show larger grains compared to HZO layers, which may lead besides doping fluctuations to increased monoclinic phase. Furthermore, the crystallographic texture in HSO is more pronounced, explaining the square-like hys-teresis observed for the HSO layer.Si-doping dependent changes in the microstructureAs mentioned before, small changes in the Si content are expected to affect the mi-crostructure and the electrical behavior quite strongly, due to the narrow doping range compared to HZO. Therefore, different doping concentrations are explored via TKD and electrical characterization. In contrast to the previously discussed layers in this chapter, TEMAHf and 3DMAS are used as precursors instead of HfCl4 and SiCl4. Ozone is used as oxidizer. More details on the processing of these samples can be found in123,207. The re-sulting microstructure for Si concentrations ranging from 2.2 cat.% to 3.3 cat.% is shown in Fig. 5.13.A major difference to the previously analyzed layers is the grain shape and size. Here, large grains (average diameter of 190 nm to 250 nm) with dendritic shape are observed alongside few disc-shaped grains. For the chlorine-based precursors, the grain size is in the range of 30 nm to 50 nm and no dendritic structures were observed.205This indicates46Figure 5.13: Crystallographic phase and microstructure of HSO films with varying doping concentration.

The suppression of monoclinic phase with higher doping, analogue to Zr, is in agreement with previous observations5,70,84,206. An interesting be-havior is observable for the monoclinic phase here. While there are a few fully monoclinic grains present, like in the previously analyzed layers, most monoclinic phase is located in dendrites or stripe like patterns inside larger orthorhombic grains. This can be observed e.g. in Fig. 5.13d. This indicates a intragranular nucleation of monoclinic phase. More insight on this process is given in section 5.5.In contrast to the difference in grain size and shape, a similar crystallographic texture as in the chlorine based layers is observed (see Fig. 5.14a-b). Again, the [010]-axis is strongly preferred in out-of-plane direction for orthorhombic phase. In addition, a out-of-plane orientation of the [100]-axis is observed, even though in much smaller quantity (see Fig. 5.14b). The comparison between the three samples reveals that the orientation distribution becomes increasingly more narrow with lower Si-doping. In consequence,48stronger texture and a rather square-like hysteresis would be expected for the sample with low Si-doping (see Fig. 5.14c).This agrees well with the observed polarization response (see Fig. 5.15).

With increasing Si-doping, the polarization response becomes less square-like, transitioning to a classical AFE-like wake-up. Moreover, analogue to the Zr-doping, the AFE-like behavior increases with higher doping concentrations. Nevertheless, textured wake-up is not observed for Zr-doped samples. Consequently, the Si-doping helps to achieve this behavior and since it is most likely based on texture, the modification of the crystallization temperature by Si-doping might explain differences in the nucleation and crystal growth behavior.

This is in agreement with the increase of monoclinic phase, as discussed for the chlorine-based Si-precursor based layer and for the Zr-doping dependence. However, no significant in-crease in [100] out-of-plane is observed for higher Si-doping, the reduction in PS for higher doping concentration appears therefore less pronounced.In summary, the precursor has a strong influence on the microstructure, most likely due to influences on the nucleation behavior. In addition, the Si-doping shows many similar-ities to Zr-doping, e.g. resulting in higher monoclinic phase for lower doping concentra-tion. Moreover, intragranular presence of monoclinic phase is observed in large dendritic grains. Furthermore, a doping dependent increase in crystallographic texture is observed.495.2.3 La doping (larger ionic radius)In contrast to Si, La has a larger ionic radius than Hf64. In addition, it is charged 3+ instead of 4+ like Hf and Si. Consequently, an oxygen vacancy (2+) will be introduced for two La ions. Nevertheless, when comparing the doping concentration dependence of La, very similar behavior is observed to Si-doping (see Fig. 5.16).Figure 5.16: DHMs of La-doped 10 nm HfO2 films reveal a transition to textured wake-up for reduced doping levels. Polarization hystereses are taken after 2*105 cycles. Details on the film preparation can be found elsewhere73,171. Figure reproduced with permission from ref. 171 Wiley.As for Si, decreasing levels of La result in textured wake-up, whereas higher levels of doping induce pronounced classical wake-up.171Even though the cycling ratios for the optimum ferroelectric properties differs to Si, the trend in behavior is very similar. This is in agreement with previous findings, which reported on an universal doping behav-ior84,189. Nevertheless, this leaves the impact of oxygen vacancies introduced by the dopant unclear.

Since both dopants have a similar doping optimum, if further enables the substitution of Si-doping cycles with Al, and vice versa. Therefore, the location of oxygen vacancies in the HfO2 layer can be controlled precisely.Comparing two stacks with symmetrical stacks, namely HSO sandwiched in between Al-doped hafnium oxide (HAO) and vice versa, no significant difference between the two50Figure 5.17: Comparison of symmetric Si and Al co-doped hafnium oxide layers. Very sim-ilar polarization hysteresis and wake-up behavior are observed for the stack order Si/Al/Si (a) and Al/Si/Al (b) annealed at 1050°C. The cycling ratio is 15:1 for both dopants. TEMAHf, 3DMAS and TMA, respectively. The displacement current of the Al/Si/Al layer (c) indicates strong asymmetries depending on the voltage sweep direction.layers is observable (see Fig. 5.17). However, the behavior is strongly asymmetric, whichcan be nicely observed in the displacement current (see Fig. 5.17c), and an initial imprintis present. Since this differs strongly from the expected behavior of pure HSO or La-doped hafnium oxide (HLO) layers, the presence of inhomogeneously distributed oxygenvacancies is affecting the switching behavior of HfO2.Figure 5.18: Influence of asymmetric doping distributions on the switching behavior. The polarization response over cycling is given for the stack order Si/Si/Al and Al/Si/Si (top to bottom) in (a) and (b), respectively. Samples with cycling ra-tios of 15:1 for Si and Al were annealed at 1050°C. Precursors are TEMAHf, 3DMAS and TMA. The imprint indicates the presence of internal bias fields, as schematically illustrated in (c), agreeing with the expected position of oxy-gen vacancies. A simplified illustration of the interaction of polarization and oxygen vacancies is presented in (d).By investigating the the two extreme cases of HAO deposited only at the top or bottomof the layer, respectively, the influence of the local arrangement of the oxygen vacanciescan be probed. From the polarization hystereses in Fig. 5.18 it can be clearly deduced, thatthe location of the HAO at the top or bottom is inducing an location dependent imprint inthe capacitor. Since the pulses are applied from the bottom of the stack, the polarity of theimprint agrees well with the internal bias field expected for the localized oxygen vacancies(see Fig. 5.18c). In addition, it is obvious that the asymmetry in the displacement current51peaks for the two directions observed prior in the symmetric layers (see Fig. 5.17c) is closely linked to this, since the asymmetry is mirrored in dependence of the Al position. Considering a simplified two dimensional representation of the possible polarization directions in combination with the local position of the oxygen vacancies at the top, it appears that most domains directly switch back when approaching zero from the positive side (see Fig. 5.18d). This is not very surprising due to the field induced by the oxygen vacancies, based on the already high polarization values, however, this suggests that the majority of the domains undergo 180° switching instead of 90° domain wall motion, which is dominating when polarizing with a positive pulse, as indicated by the two displacement current peaks. While some domains still undergo 90° switching indicated by the much smaller second switching peak at negative voltages, the majority of domains is pinned to the out-of-plane orientation in one direction. Considering the electric field induced by the polarization directions, the difference between the in-plane directions is rather small and therefore they would both not contribute significantly to the charge compensation of the oxygen vacancies. The presence of in-plane tensile stress, however, supports in-plane orientation. Upon a positive pulse, the first domains switch to the in-plane directions. Due to the field by the oxygen vacancies and the present tensile stress, a 180° switching process is unfavorable, as it would be opposite to the two forces. Only for higher applied positive voltages the out-of-plane orientation becomes favorable. For the back switching process, on the other hand, the tensile stress would still support the in-plane orientation, while the pinning and field induced by the oxygen vacancies would favor a out-of-plane orientation. Since the latter is also supported by the applied field, 180° domain switching is observed",1010
Volltext (PDF).docx,experiment,"ally for most domains. The oxygen vacancies consequently act as pinning sites. This has also been suggested by recent findings216. For the more complex three-dimensional system, three peaks are expected, which are observable in e.g. Fig. 5.17c.While this matches nicely to the observed behavior for the asymmetric stacks, this does at first glance not explain the behavior observed for the symmetric layers, since the vacan-cies are not expected to be located on one side of the stack. When comparing symmetric stacks where either the Al or Si is in the outer layers, forming the interface with TiN (see Fig. 5.17), however, it is obvious that the imprint is independently present. From the po-larity of the imprint, it can be deduced that the oxygen vacancies are located at the top of the layer. Since the two electrode processes differ, it therefore appears likely, that the top electrode induces oxygen vacancy generation or diffusion (e.g. of the vacancies induced by the Al-doping). Similar findings agree with an accumulation of oxygen vacancies at the TiN interface as well217. This would then nicely explain the switching behavior in symmet-ric stacks and further explain the minor quantitative difference in imprint observed for the asymmetric stacks.Since no de- or increased pinching effects are observable for different oxygen vacancy concentrations, e.g. when comparing the symmetric stacks with different Si and Al doping52levels, it further adds evidence that they are not inducing a phase transition from mono-clinic phase, as suggested previously111, nor from or to the tetragonal phase103,106. Fur-thermore, the directional dependence of the switching process, further underlines that the presence of 90° domain wall movement.In summary, it can be concluded that oxygen vacancies cause internal bias fields and additional pinning of domains, resulting in a modulation of 90° and 180° switching pro-cesses. Furthermore, the intentional incorporation of e.g. Al-doping layers allows to engi-neer a desired internal field, as well as scavenging effects218,219may result in the formation of oxygen vacancies at one TiN interface.5.3 Annealing influencesAs mentioned before, the crystallization behavior seems to play an important role in HfO2 layers. Therefore, the influence of the annealing temperature is investigated. As men-tioned in section 5.2.1, the annealing time does not appear to effect the behavior signifi-cantly.GIXRD patterns are collected for HSO films in a MFM and MFIS film respectively (see Fig. 5.19). Here, X-ray amorphous behavior is observed at an annealing temperature of 500°C and 550°C for MFM and MFIS, respectively. For MFM a semi-crystalline pattern is present for an annealing temperature of 550°C. Both stack configurations appear to be fully crystalline from 600°C onward. The transition from amorphous to crystalline can be well observed when visualizing the normalized integrated intensity of the (111) line (see Fig. 5.19e). From this graph substrate dependent differences in the slope of this transition can be deduced. In addition, an additional increase of the integrated intensity is observed for even higher temperatures above 700°C. A possible explanation for the difference in slope could be differences in the nucleation behavior. If the nucleation on the TiN bottom electrode is of heterogeneous nature, which consumes lower energy, compared to a ho-mogeneous nucleation in case of a SiO2 substrate layer, this would explain the observed differences.220The additional increase above 700°C, on the other hand, does not fit to the observed trend for the initial crystallization and might therefore be related to changes in crystallographic texture or other effects.In addition to the observed differences in the crystallization process, changes in the patterns of the fully crystalline films are present as well. For the MFM configuration (see Fig. 5.19c), an continuous increase in the (100) signal is observed when increasing the an-nealing temperature. This reaches values exceeding the expected intensity for randomly distributed orientations. In addition, the emergence of (110) signal can be observed for temperatures above 750°C. No significant increase of the line intensity is observed for the two monoclinic lines close to 30°. Furthermore, the {200} lines exceed the intensity of the53Figure 5.19: Annealing temperature dependent GIXRD patterns of MFM (a) and MFIS (b) HSO stacks. GIXRD patterns of the MFM stack (c) show a pronounced [100] out-of-plane texture, which is absent in the patterns of the MFIS stacks (d). Normalized integrated intensity of the (111) line is compared in (e). Figures reproduced with permission from ref. 220. Copyright 2021 American Chem-ical Society.54(111) line, which is not expected. Therefore, a pronounced texture is expected for thesefilms.220While the increase in (110) signal is observable for the MFIS stack as well (see Fig. 5.19d),the (100) signal is strongly reduced compared to the MFM stack. In addition, also muchlower intensity is observed for the {200} lines at around 35°.220Figure 5.20: TKD analysis of HSO MFM stacks annealed at different temperatures. Com-bined phase and quality map (a) of a HSO sample annealed at 750°C indicates microstructure of small grains dominated by orthorhombic phase. Analysis of the polarization axis angle with respect to the sample surface (b) indicates an in-plane orientation for both annealing temperatures, but increased out-of-plane alignment of this axis is observed for the 750°C anneal. IPFs (c) of for the two samples indicate an out-of-plane texture for the <100>-axes, which is increasing with annealing temperature. A schematic representation of the preferred growth orientations for different substrates is given in (d).For an improved understanding of the structural evolution in dependence of the anneal-ing structure, TKD measurements on selected samples are conducted. While this sectionis focusing on the MFM",1362
Volltext (PDF).docx,results,", a detailed analysis of the MFIS samples is provided in sec- tion 5.5.. Like in the previous analysis of HfCl4-based HSO films, small disc-shaped grains are present, as observable in the combined phase and quality map (see Fig.. 5.20a).. Here, 55 also small fully monoclinic grains are located inside a mainly orthorhombic film.. In Fig.. 5.20b, the angle between the polarization axis and the sample surface is visualized.. While the sample annealed at 600°C shows mostly in-plane aligned domains, with only very few regions of out-of-plane orientation, a significant shift in behavior is observed for the sam-ple annealed at 750°C.. For this layer, grains with a majority of polarization axes pointing out-of-plane are present.. Moreover, many grains contain larger regions with out-of-plane alignment.. It is therefore evident that an increased out-of-plane texture of the [001] axis is present, which is expected to result in increased ferroelectric behavior.220 This behavior is reflected in the IPFs as well (see Fig.. 5.20c).. A strong out-of-plane texture of the [010]-axis is observed for the sample annealed at 600°C.. No significant orientation density in out-of-plane direction is observed for the [100]- and [001]-axis.. This agrees well with the low (100) signal in the GIXRD pattern.. In addition, the pronounced [010] texture explains the high signal of the {200} lines.. Moving to higher annealing temperatures, it orientations density increases for the [100]-, [010]- and [001]-axis.. This does not only ex-plain the increase in out-of-plane orientation of the polarization axis, as observed in the IPF maps, but also the increase in (100) signal with temperature in the GIXRD.. Addition-ally, an increase of all three <100>-axes indicates a strong alignment of the pseudo-cubic unit-cell with the TiN substrate, as depicted in Fig.. 5.20d..",469
Volltext (PDF).docx,results,"in a broadening of the GIXRD line (see Fig.5.22b). In addition, the thinnest layer appears to be X-ray amor-phous and therefore did most likely not crystallize. This indicates that the crystallization temperature of the amorphous layer is altered by its thickness, in agreement with previous observations23,98,200.Comparing different Zr-doping concentrations for these layers, a similar trend in the polarization response like for the 10 nm HZO samples (section 5.2.1) is observed (see Fig. 5.23). For 2x5 nm the highest PS is achieved for 1:1 Hf:Zr cycling ratio for pristine condition.58Figure 5.23: Polarization evolution in ultra thin laminated HZO layers with varying Zr con-tent. All samples were annealed at 800°C. Ferroelectric phase fraction can be estimated based on the PS values prior (greyscale) and post (colored) electric field cycling for a 3.5 V amplitude (a). From the PR/PS ratio (b), the degree of AFE-like behavior can be analyzed. The initially strong pinched hysteresis of the sample with a cycling ratio of 3:7 Hf:Zr (c) suggest an insufficient amplitude for full loop operation in pristine condition.59Analogously, PS reduces for lower Zr-content. The reduction of PS for higher Zr-content is present in pristine condition as well, however, upon cycling, PS increases and reaches values similar or higher to 1:1 cycling ratio. While this could be explainable due to electric field-induced crystallization, an analysis of the polarization curve strongly suggests, that the original reduced PS was due to an insufficient amplitude to switch the domains that ex-hibit strong AFE-like behavior (see Fig. 5.23c). Since the polarization values for 2x5 nm are similar to the sample without interlayer and no increased presence of monoclinic phase is observed, it appears reasonable to assume that both layers act ferroelectric and are of orthorhombic phase.Upon cycling, another interesting effect is observable. While all devices of the 10 nm sample show breakdown after cycling, for the 2x5 nm sample with 1:1 cycling ratio some devices still survive. For higher Zr-content not a single device did break down. This high-lights the possibility to increase endurance by the inclusion of interlayers. Two factors are likely responsible for this: First, the interlayer introduces an additional capacitance. Even though the voltage drop across this layer is expected to be small, it still resembles a finite voltage drop, resulting in lower field for the other layers. Second, the interlayer will suppress the formation of leakage paths directly through the HfO2-layer, e.g. by oxy-gen vacancy filaments as utilized in resistive random access memory (RRAM)223–225. This effect is even more pronounced for 3x3.3 nm, where no breakdown is observed for all concentrations.The 3x3.3 nm samples show in addition a shift in the doping optimum to Hf-rich layers. For high Zr-content, only dielectric behavior is observed (see Fig. S1a in the appendix). Such thickness dependent doping dependence has previously not been reported for Zr, whereas it has been observed for e.g. Si-doping3,69. The presence of this effect now for Zr as well underlines the mechanical stress driven nature of the ferroelectric phase in the fluorite structured material system of HfO2 and ZrO2. Nevertheless, all layers exhibit significantly lower polarization values. A closer look at the displacement currents reveals the presence of imprint (see Fig. S1b in the appendix). Moreover, dead layer effects due to defects close to the interface might have an increasing influence in these ultra thin layers31,226.For Si-doping, lower polarization values are observed for all doping concentrations in the 2x5 nm films (see Fig. 5.24). However, higher voltage amplitude allows to recover this partially. Analogue to the Zr-doped films, a trend to AFE-like behavior is observable for higher doping content, and lower doping",915

Stable PS values (b), except for low Si-doping linked to increased monoclinic phase, suggest no significant changes in crystallinity and texture.

At higher temperatures, these stress levels might be reduced due to stress relaxation.

However, for ultra thin HfO2 the max-imum polarization reduces, most likely due to the presence of defects/dead layer effects as also indicated by imprint.. Nevertheless, the thickness dependent doping optimum for Zr and Si strongly indicates that the phase formation and electrical behavior of HfO2 is mainly driven by mechanical stress.. 5.5 Interface layer influences That the presence of an interface layer, like in MFIS stacks, strongly influences the struc-tural behavior has been mentioned by the sections above before.. In section 5.3, differ-ences in the GIXRD patterns are present, and in section 5.4, GIXRD patterns suggested the presence of two differently stressed layers if an interlayer is introduced.. This section now focuses on the changes induced by the presence of an interface layer (MFIS stack) compared to MFM characterization.. While the first part focuses on the structural differ-ences in the HfO2 layer, the second part focuses on the chemical and structural behavior of the interface layer itself and how the electrical behavior of the stack is influenced by the 62 structural changes as well as by the interaction of the two layers and the semiconductor below.. Finally the impact on the Si-doping profile is evaluated.. 5.5.1 Structural differences in the HfO2 layer As mentioned, structural differences were observed via GIXRD analysis..

On the one hand, the interface layer introduces a capacitance in series, acting as a voltage devider, and, as it cannot compensate the polarization induced charge, a depolarization field131,137.. On the other hand, the semiconductor will add a non-linear capacitance modifying the present field distribution further..

This reaches even extends, where AFE-like behavior is observed in one direction, whereas ferroelectric behavior is observed in the other (see Fig.. 5.29a).227This is similar to the asymmetric behavior observed for the co-doped samples in section 5.2.4..

For lower stress values, less ferroelastic contributions are expected, thus matching nicely to the observed behavior.228The increase in thickness, however, has certain drawbacks.

This can be observed in Fig. 5.33a.

Extracted figures of merit for GIXRD and polarization measurements are given in (a) and (b), respectively. Figures reproduced with permission from ref. 220. Copyright 2021 American Chemical Society.71Based on this data, many observed effects in MFM and MFIS stacks can be explained. In Fig. 5.34, important figures of merit are compared in dependence of the annealing temperature. Here, a clear shift of the (111)-line to lower values is observed. Shifts in the peak position can be attributed to the presence of mechanical stress. While higher values resemble an out-of-plane compressive stress, lower values correspond to tensile stress. Therefore, the shift resembles a reduction in in-plane tensile stress with increasing tem-perature. In case of MFIS stacks, this trend is shifted to higher temperatures. Neverthe-less, for both stack configurations, an increase in (110) signal is observed in the transition range. Consequently, it appears very likely that the two trends, growth of [110] texture and stress relaxation, are correlated. The temperature, where the (110) signal exceeds random distributions (gray line) fits also very nicely with the aforementioned emergence of a tail in the polarization hysteresis.220The stress relaxation should be observable in the PR/PS ratio as well, if ferroelastic switching is the underlying mechanism for AFE-like behavior. Indeed an increase in this ratio is observable with increasing temperature. That the shape of the curves differ from the transition observed in the GIXRD patterns is most likely due to a different influence of the mechanical stress on the respective figures of merit. Furthermore, the difference in crystallographic texture will alter the stress dependence for MFM and MFIS stacks. Never-theless, it can be observed that for low annealing temperatures, the MFIS samples are not capable of a full wake-up, as indicated by the strongly reduced PR value post cycling.220Another major difference between the MFM and MFIS stacks is the presence of <100> out-of-plane texture in the former. This can be clearly deduced from the (100) signal in these stacks. In case of MFM stacks, the intensity exceeds already the expected value by far for the lowest annealing temperature producing crystalline layers. As observed by TKD a continuous increase in intensity is observed with annealing temperature as well. The origin of this has been identified to be a templating effect, as discussed previously. This manifests itself in the increased PR values for MFM stacks as well, since an parallel alignment of the polarization axis (post wake-up) is supported by this templating effect. Due to an analogue increase in the out-of-plane [100] texture, which resembles a non-polar axis, the 2PR values do not reach even higher values.220Finally, the major increase in coercive field in MFIS stacks is clearly related to the pres-ence of an interface layer as well as the absence of <100> out-of-plane texture. The further increase with annealing temperature has already been related to interface growth before.Consequently, the interface layer thickness and composition is altered during the an-nealing process, resulting in a change in the residual stress levels, which are the domi-nating influence on the wake-up behavior of the samples. Furthermore, it was demon-strated that the ferroelectric-like non-split wake-up is governed by ferroelastic switching. In addition to the stress influences, depolarization fields, due to the interface layer, have strong effects on the retention. Nevertheless, due to changes in the composition during72annealing, this is not as pronounced as expected and interface nitridation offers further possibilities to enhance interface thickness without retention penalty.5.5.3 Substrate-driven changes in the Si-doping profileSince the MFIS stack strongly alters the structural and electrical behavior of hafnium oxide films, and the presence of an interlayer already caused shifts in the optimum doping con-centration, it is only logical to investigate the doping dependence for MFIS stacks. Since doping with Si is more sensitive due to the narrow doping window, the behavior of differ-ently doped HSO layers is explored in this section.Figure 5.35: Si-doping dependence of the polarization response in MFIS stacks. Initial po-larization hystereses of the samples with different Hf:Si cycling ratio annealed at 1050°C are given in (a). Corresponding displacement currents are given in (b). A schematic illustration of the domain structure during the switching process of the 10:1 sample is presented in (c). Figures reproduced with per-mission from ref. 181 Springer.Surprisingly, no significant differences are observed in the polarization response for a wide doping range (see Fig. 5.35a). Only the sample with very high Si-doping (10:1 Hf:Si) shows an increase in PR and PS as well as a reduction in coercive field. Analysis of the displacement current (see Fig. 5.35b) reveals peak splitting in positive voltage direction for the 10:1 sample in addition. For the other samples only insignificant differences can be observed. Two strongly overlapping peaks are present in the displacement current for these samples. Based on these and previous",1158
Volltext (PDF).docx,results,", it can therefore be concluded that the asymmetric behavior can be described by the following domain evolution (see Fig. 5.35c): Initially, the domains are randomly oriented, most likely arranged in-plane due to the presence of residual tensile stress. Upon applying an electric field, the 90° and partially 180° domain wall movement takes place, resulting in an out-of-plane domain structure. Upon field reversal, the polarization is switching ferroelectric (180° domain wall movement), since only a single sharp peak is observed in the displacement current. In the other direction, however, the switching process takes place via 90° domain wall movement, as indicated by the two displacement current peaks. After wake-up, it has been reported by the FORC measurements that the two peaks merge (see Fig. 5.29d), consequently the switching process transits to 180° switching on this side as well.181While73this holds some similarities to the previously discussed asymmetric wake-up in the co-doped samples, the behavior differs slightly due to the absence of oxygen vacancies acting as pinning sites.Figure 5.36: Structural and chemical characterization of MFIS samples with different Si-doping concentrations.

An exemplary survey scan of the Si 2p peak is shown in (c), indicating no significant difference in the energy spectra. Figures repro-duced with permission from ref. 181 Springer.For deeper insight into the structural origin of the observed differences, GIXRD patterns are collected (see Fig. 5.36a). Here, most samples show a pronounced (110) signal and no significant monoclinic phase fractions. Only for the 10:1 sample, differences are ap-parent. The (100) and (110) signal are strongly reduced, but the {200} lines do not show even suggest slightly higher intensities of the (020) and (002) lines.181The difference in crystallographic texture might explain the observed differences. Less [110] out-of-plane texture would correspond to less domains with a high coercive field, agreeing with the smaller coercive field observed in this sample. Furthermore would the less [100] out-of-plane texture for a constant out-of-plane texture of the sum of <100>-axes result in increased polarization values, agreeing with the observed hysteresis as well. Increased AFE-like behavior might be further a result of changes in the residual stress level due to a doping modified crystallization temperature or a higher depolarization field due to a higher amount of ferroelectric/-elastic axes aligning out-of-plane.18174Nevertheless, the doping window in MFIS stacks appears to be very wide in terms of electrical and structural behavior. XPS (see Fig. 5.36b and 5.36c) confirm similar doping levels in MFIS and MFM layers. The electrical response of the MFM devices, however, differs strongly (see Fig. 5.37a).181Figure 5.37: Comparison of MFM and MFIS samples with different Si-doping levels. The polarization hystereses of the MFM samples (a) behave significantly different from the MFIS samples, showing increased AFE-like behavior.

The MFIS samples on the other hand show only a minor increase with higher doping concentrations. This increase appears almost insignificant compared to the sharp drop to a remanent polarization of zero at even lower Si-content in case of the MFM devices.181A change of 0.5% Si-doping in case of the MFM samples, e.g. for the two lowest concentrations with differences in monoclinic phase fraction,",153

The drop for at high doping concentrations, however, is in a large part related to the insufficient voltage amplitude to switch domains which show strong AFE-like behavior. The initial increase has already been related previously to a reduction in monoclinic phase. The much higher PS values in case of MFM devices stem from the pronounced [010] out-of-plane texture, whereas this texture is absent in case of MFIS samples. Instead they have a larger degree of ferroelastic/-electric axes aligning in a tilted position. The small change in these values for the MFIS devices has already been assigned to changes in crystallographic texture above.181The major difference in the doping range of Si for MFM and MFIS samples observed here is not easily explainable by any of the mechanisms excluded before.

At low stress levels, the transition to monoclinic phase is no longer fully sup-pressed, whereas at high stress levels super-cooled tetragonal phase might be present. Consequently, increased phase fractions for the two phases are expected in the respective regions. In between, the orthorhombic Pca21 phase is dominating. Dependent on the stress level, the polarization axis will be located either in-plane or out-of-plane and the film will therefore behave either AFE-like or ferroelectric, respectively. The films tensile stress will be influenced by e.g. doping level, interface layer (IL) thickness and annealing temperature.

For ferroelastic switching on the other hand, this behavior is easily explainable by the present mechanical stress. The previously reported growth of the interface layer in combination with the interface thickness dependent stress relaxation allows to explain the observed differences. Furthermore, these",515
Volltext (PDF).docx,results,"underline the aforementioned hy-pothesis that the phase formation and ferroelectric behavior is purely stress driven. In consequence, the behavior can be summarized in a mechanical stress driven phase dia-gram, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5.38.181In summary, it has been shown, that the interface layer alters the microstructure of hafnium oxide films strongly. The nucleation is most likely of homogeneous nature, re-sulting in large dendritic and orthorhombic grains. Strong evidence is provided that the nucleation process of monoclinic phase is often intragranular in these layers, due to a criti-cal grain size of the orthorhombic grains. In addition, the interface layer strongly alters the mechanical stress and electrical behavior of hafnium oxide, introducing a phenomenolog-ical asymmetric (AFE-like) wake-up. Thicker interfaces result in a strong stress relaxation, revealing that non-split wake-up is still governed by ferroelastic switching and enable a larger doping window for dopants like Si.765.6 Phenomenological wake-up behaviors and process guidelinesThe previous sections have thoroughly discussed the induced changes in electrical be-havior due to structural differences in the microstructure and adjacent layers. In addi-tion these structural changes can be related to process parameters or stack develop-ment. While all of these different electric behaviors have been related to either electric field-induced crystallization or ferroelastic switching, they can be summarized in five phe-nomenological extreme cases of wake-up which are presented below. In addition, process guidelines will be given alongside on how these wake-up behaviors can be achieved.The most unique wake-up behavior is the sudden wake-up (see Fig. 5.39a), which has been discussed in section 4.2 and 5.2.1, which is a result of the electric field-induced crys-tallization. The prerequisites for this effect are an amorphous layer containing fine nuclei. Furthermore, tuning the crystallization temperature by thickness and doping enables to stabilize this behavior and to engineer a superposition with the other behaviors in semi-crystalline layers.171,182The other basic wake-up behavior is classical wake-up (see Fig. 5.39b) in the group of AFE-like wake-up behaviors. This wake-up is associated with an in-plane orientation of the polarization axis and present residual tensile stress, inducing backswitching. Conse-quently, this wake-up behavior is closely linked, like all AFE-like wake-up effects, to the fer-roelastic switching process. Moreover, it is present in most hafnium oxide layers.168,171,195 Inducing higher stress levels, e.g. by introducing interlayers further stabilizes this behav-ior.With increasing crystallographic texture, e.g. by a pronounced templating effect due to semi-epitaxial growth (see section 5.2.2 and 5.3), a square-like hysteresis is observed (see Fig. 5.39c), which can also exhibit tails at higher voltages. It can be stabilized by e.g. Si, Al and La doping, most likely due to optimized crystallization temperature. Due to this dependence on crystallographic texture, this behavior is referred to as textured wake-up which has been grouped with the AFE-like wake-up behaviors.171,205,220The last wake-up behavior of this group has been observed in MFIS stacks and co-doped samples. Here, strong asymmetric behavior is observed depending on the switching di-rection (see Fig. 5.39d). This asymmetric wake-up behavior is most likely due to influences resulting from electric fields resulting from e.g. depolarization or inhomogeneous oxygen vacancy distribution. It can be stabilized by the presence of an interface layer alongside higher stress levels171,181,204,227,228or by asymmetric co-doping.Finally, there is non-split wake-up (see Fig. 5.39e). In contrast to the previous three AFE-like wake-up behaviors, initially ferroelectric-like behavior is observed. While it has been shown that ferroelastic switching is still in parts present in those samples, cycling quickly",940

Second, the increased amount of monoclinic phase in the HSO layer would explain broken devices with no MW in the case of scaled devices.205 In addition, MFIS stacks with Si- and SiGe-substrate have been explored in section 5.5 before. The reasoning for this is the integration of p-type FeFETs. Up to now, n-type transistors have been considered for the integration of FeFETs3,6,7, due to the low hole mobility in silicon that prohibits equally good performing p-type field-effect transistors232. By developing co-integrated p-FeFETs, new circuit designs become accessible and might prove especially useful in applications like near-/in-memory computing142,233–235and re-configurable logic236. To overcome the low hole mobility in silicon, silicon germanium (SiGe) can be employed as channel material, analogously to p-type field effect transistors in common CMOS processes237.Since the addition of Ge is known to alter the oxidation behavior of Si237–242, the be-havior of the interface layer in conjunction with the crystal growth of hafnium oxide on this substrate is of major concern. Furthermore, the addition of Ge has been investigated in order to achieve interface free FeFETs239–246, which are expected to show improved endurance and retention due to the absence of the interface37. While scavenging metal electrodes have been explored to achieve interface-free devices as well218,219,247, they come with the downside of drastically increased leakage currents due to increased oxy-gen vacancy levels in the hafnium oxide layer.Nevertheless, the",529

As shown by Fig. 6.6b, the parameter c strongly influences the backswitching behavior, whereas kJA (Fig. 6.6c) affects the mean coercive field and γJA (Fig. 6.6d) its distribution. Like mentioned previously, αJA affects the inter-domain coupling (Fig. 6.6e) and the constant relative permittivity affects the slope in saturation regime (Fig. 6.6f).Having now a sub-loop compatible model for the ferroelectric layer, this can be intro-duced into the common analytical metal-oxide-semiconductor model in dependence of an externally applied voltage Vext 254. Due to the additional ferroelectric capacitance, equ. 6.26 is extended compared to the classical model by an additional voltage drop across the ferroelectric layer VFE. However, due to the non-linear contributions induced by the polarization, the surface potential ΦS of the semiconductor, and the voltage drop across the interface layer VIL, which is dependent on the total charge Qtot and the interface layer capacitance CIL, are dependent on the voltage drop across the ferroelectric layer as well due to charge conversion. Only the potential drop ΦMS, which is due to the band align-89Figure 6.6: Influence of the parameters in the Jiles-Atherton-based ferroelectric model.

Here, εS is the relative permittivity of the semiconductor, Na is the acceptor doping concentration, q is the elementary charge, Qfix is the amount of fixed charges at the interface between interface layer and ferroelectric layer, εFE is the relative permittivity of the ferroelectric layer, and tFE is the thickness of the ferroelectric layer.Q2 tot (6.28) ΦS = sign(Qtot) 2εSNaqWhile these equations combined with the previous ferroelectric model for the polar-Qtot = Qfix + P(VFE) +εFE∗ VFE (6.29)ization describe the MFIS stack and therefore a FeFET analytically, the equations are notanalytically solvable for a defined Vext. Moreover, due to the ferroelectric hysteresis, the model is dependent on the signal history. Nevertheless, the equations can be solved nu-merically for an external signal or by defining a VFE signal, allowing to solve the equations analytically.Figure 6.7: Comparison of modeled (a) and measured (b) CV curves of an hafnium oxide-based MFIS capacitor.91This already allows to calculate the field distribution inside MFIS stacks. Moreover, since the capacitance of the ferroelectric layer is defined by the derivative of the polarization with respect to the applied voltage, and the capacitance of the semiconductor is defined by equ. 6.30, the non-linear capacitance response of the MFIS stack can be calculated.

Nevertheless, the MFIS polarization hystereses are further influenced by the ferroelastic switching process, inducing AFE-like behavior, and charge trapping effects, which are not accounted for. Increasing the thickness of the ferroelectric layer has a similar effect (see Fig. S2 in the appendix).Figure 6.9: Calculated band structure based on the",146

Pockets at the interface between hafnium oxide and interface layer are present for electrones and holes in the high (a) and low Vt state (b), respectively.From the calculated values a simplified band structure model can be drawn as well (see Fig. 6.9). It is obvious that a pocket is present between the interface and ferroelectric layer, where trapped charges could accumulate. It has been previously suggested that trapped charges might stabilize the polarization state, improving retention256. However, the re-quired oxygen vacancy densities are often unreasonably high and the screening of the polarization state by these charges is often neglected. Moreover, even though trapped charges in the range of 10% of the polarization induce asymmetries in the field distribu-tion, no significant differences in the depolarization field is observed at zero external bias (see Fig. 6.10).Finally, interfaces with higher permittivity decrease the depolarization field, as well as thicker interfaces result in an increase (see Fig. S3 in the appendix), which has also been suggested previously133and is in agreement with",238
Volltext (PDF).docx,results,"in section 5.5. Consequently, it has been shown that the higher effective coercive field present in MFIS stacks due to the tilted polarization axes is favorable for retention and is sufficient to explain stable retention in FeFETs. In addition, trapped charges in the pocket between interface and ferroelectric layer are not the origin for drastically improved retention. MFIS stacks should be designed with high permittivity thin interface layers with thicker ferroelectric layers.93Figure 6.10: Field-distribution in MFIS stacks dependent on the presence of charges at the ferroelectric-insulator interface. Asymmetries are introduced for negative (a) and positive (c) charges of 5*10–6 μC/cm2compared to the stack without charges (b).Nevertheless, thicker interfaces reduce the trapping probability of charges into the pocket and the following section will explore how this and defect densities in the interface layer affect endurance.6.1.2 Endurance improvements by interface fluorinationFigure 6.11: Overview of the samples used for investigating the impact of fluorination on the endurance.While the previously presented model explains many observations in FeFETs, like asym-metric hysteresis curves as well as the impact of thickness and permittivity changes, charge trapping effects and defects might further alter the device behavior. In order to improve endurance of the devices, a fluorination process is applied to saturate defects in the in-terface and ferroelectric layer. The fluorination is performed directly after the interface and/or ferroelectric layer, respectively (see Fig. 6.11a). The different combinations were investigated for SiO2 and SiON interfaces (see Fig. 6.11b). As shown for a reference SiON FeFET (see Fig. 6.11c), the MW opens initially and stays in a stable regime. For higher cycle numbers, the MW closes and a degradation in the slope of the transfercharacteristic is vis-ible. The dielectric device, based on undoped HfO2 does not show a MW and no walk-out to high or low threshold voltages is visible.94Figure 6.12: Cycling endurance of SiON-based FeFETs with different fluorination pro-cesses. In addition evolution of the conductance gm is given in insets.Comparing this now with the fluorinated SiON devices, a drastic increase in endurance is observable for the devices with interface fluorination (see Fig. 6.12). The MW stays longer constant and no overall shift in threshold voltage is observable. For the device with the fluorination of the ferroelectric layer only (wafer D), a MW closure like in case of the reference is present. Prior, hole trapping is observable in the high Vt state. In case of higher voltage amplitudes, a walk-out to higher threshold voltages is observed. Moreover, the devices with fluorinated ferroelectric layers show a bulge in the low Vt to lower values for intermediate cycle numbers. This is especially pronounced in the device with both, interface and ferroelectric, fluorinations, resulting in a MW of more than 2 V. Since this is only achieved in a narrow cycling range, this is not favorable for the large scale integration. These changes are nicely summarized in Fig. 6.13a, confirming an endurance increase by more than one order of magnitude in case of the interface fluorination. Moreover, these devices survive almost 104cycles even at an amplitude of 7.5 V.Figure 6.13: Comparison of the MW evolution over cycling for SiON- and SiO2-based Fe-FETs. (a) indicates a significant endurance gain by interface fluorination for different amplitudes. Evolution of the Vt states over cycling for the SiO2-based FeFETs is given in (b).95The SiO2-based FeFETs show an increased walk-out to high Vt at high numbers of cycles, as compared to the SiON-based devices (see Fig. 6.13b). As a result, the endurance of the MW in Fig. 6.13a is overestimated for high amplitudes. Even though the SiO2 device with fluorination of the interface and ferroelectric layer shows a worse performance for 5 V, the performance at higher voltages is much better compared to the reference device. Less hole trapping and walk-out are observable.In addition to the endurance behavior, the transconductance gm at Vt is much more stable for the devices with interface fluorination. On the other hand, devices without this show a strong decrease of gm with cycling. Consequently, no slope degradation is ob-served for devices with interface fluorination, thus underlining the positive effects of this process on the endurance. However, to understand the origin of this behavior, defect characterization is essential.Figure 6.14: Normalized current power spectral density SID pre and post cycling for the erase state. No significant differences prior (a) and post (b) cycling are ob-servable for the FeFETs with interface fluorination.For identifying the defect densities in the stack and their impact on the device perfor-mance, charge pumping257and flicker noise258,259characterization are applied. These methods have been recently demonstrated to be suitable for the characterization of Fe-FETs as well260. The noise characterization surprisingly reveals an increased noise spectra in the current domain (SID) for the devices with interface fluorination (see Fig. 6.14a). In addition, almost no difference in the SID is observable after cycling (see Fig. 6.14b), except for the devices with fluorination of the ferroelectric layer. This suggests no degradation of the interface layer upon cycling. While this would have been expected for the devices with interface fluorination, which did not show a degradation in gm as well, it is unexpected for the devices without. Furthermore, the increased noise level for devices with interface96fluorination suggest higher defect densities in the interface layer. Only, the SiO2-based devices differ in behavior, which might be related to a different oxide thickness.Figure 6.15: Charge pumping",1335

Here, a decrease in interface defect density DIT is observable for fluorinated devices. For SiON-based FeFETs, the device with fluorination of the ferroelectric layer shows the lowest DIT. After cycling, the values increase strongly, resulting in much higher values, except for the dielectric wafer. The SiO2 reference wafer did not even survive the cycling. Since charge pumping investigates also defects farther away from the channel compared to flicker noise, the increase is therefore likely related to the defects in the ferroelectric layer.In consequence, these",175

Volltext (PDF).docx,results,", these charges will not move through the entire stack when switching the state.. Such a current flow through the hafnium oxide might generate defects along the way.. These generated defects would then degrade the device, resulting in reduced gm and accumulate charges resulting in walk-out to the high Vt. For the de-trapping via a noisy interface however, these effects should be suppressed, matching nicely to the stable gm and improved endurance.. Furthermore, it matches with the increased noise level observed for SiON and even higher levels for the fluorinated SiON interfaces.. To confirm this mechanism further analysis of the energy distribution and depth of the defects is required.. In summary, an increase of one order of magnitude in endurance is demonstrated by interface fluorination.. The physical origin is suggested to be due to an increased defect density in the interface layer, supporting electron de-trapping in the FeFET.. This is most likely also supporting the endurance increase already observed in case of the SiON inter-faces.. 97 6.2 Neuromorphic devices and circuits While the previous sections focused on the endurance and retention, this part will focus on the device performance in terms of neuromorphic applications and will further add insight into variability origins in FeFET devices.. For investigating the synaptic behavior of FeFETs, it is important to consider the major differences to common synaptic devices, like RRAM and phase-change random access memory (PCRAM)184,223,261–266.. Those devices act as two-terminal resistors and are able to change their resistivity via applied pulses with larger amplitude to the same terminals.. The analogue structure for ferroelectric hafnium oxide layers, however, resembles a two-terminal capacitor (see Fig.. 6.16a).. In consequence, the polarization state cannot be read out without destruction, prohibiting the application as synaptic device analogue to the resistive devices.. An ex-ception however is the FTJ device, which requires either much thinner hafnium oxide lay-ers189,267,268or uses the ferroelectric to modify the field across an tunneling oxide and therefore change the current flow269–272.. Alternatively, the polarization state can be read out in a FeFET.. This brings many advantages for the application as synaptic device, as a much higher dynamic range should be achievable due to the non-linear response of the field-effect transistor.. In addition, the non-destructive read is possible and the three-or four-terminal structure of the FeFET (see Fig.. 6.16b) enables to decouple read and write operations.. Analogue to the two-terminal devices, pulse sequences can be used to change the conductance state of the channel (see Fig..",564

Considering just the simplified microsturcture with an effective grain size of 100 nm (see Fig. 6.19a and 6.19b), it is already clearly observable, that the con-struction and deconstruction of percolation paths differs strongly. While the LTP forms a percolation path first based on the domains with low angles and continuously grows with domains of larger angles, the LTD starts the deconstruction of paths with low angle grains first. Consequently, the paths present in LTD will differ from LTP. In addition, due to the unequal distribution of orientations in the film, commonly defined by a crystallo-graphic texture with tilted polarization axes in MFIS stacks (see section 5.5), the amplitude at which the first path forms or last path breaks will differ as well. This can be clearly ob-served in Fig. 6.19c, which shows a much earlier on set of Vt change for erasing compared101Figure 6.19: Simulated formation and destruction of current percolation paths in FeFETs. Lateral formation and destruction of percolation paths is illustrated in (a) and (b), respectively.

Consequently, it is no surprise that the LTD is much more abrupt and non-linear compared to LTP under symmetric amplitude conditions.274Moreover, these",349
Volltext (PDF).docx,results,"clearly indicate that the grain size does not affect this strongly, resulting mainly in larger variability. Nevertheless, a slight shift to lower and higher voltages in average is observed for LTD and LTP, respectively, with larger grains, thus intensifying the aforementioned effect, resulting in slightly increased asymmetry of the two switching processes.274By adapting the switching voltages, this effect can be partially counteracted, resulting in improved symmetry of LTP and LTD as presented in Fig. 6.20. It can be clearly observed that the ID becomes more linear the for lower voltage amplitudes (see Fig. 6.20a). More-over, a shift to lower non-linearity coefficients is observable (see Fig. 6.20b). In contrast to the previous signal optimization, where a reduction will result in the same or even lower effective MW and therefore equal or lower dynamic range, here an increase in the effective MW is observable (see Fig. 6.20c).Since the current percolation paths strongly influence the switching behavior as dis-cussed in the previous section and are dependent on the microstructure of the device, the102Figure 6.20: Signal optimization for symmetric response of LTP and LTD in HSO FeFETs. Symmetric LTP and LTD is achieved for 0.75 V lower amplitudes in case of LTD (a). The non-linearity is further strongly reduced for LTD with lower voltage amplitudes (b). Effective MWs for the different signal conditions is shown in (c).crystallographic orientation, grain size and the device dimensions should have a strong in-fluence. Comparing the switching behavior for different device dimensions (see Fig. 6.21a and 6.21b), it is obvious, that the average number of intermediate steps extracted from the current percolation path simulation275,277is not solely dependent on the area, but shows a pronounced width and length dependence. While wide channels allow to achieve large numbers of intermediate steps (except for very short devices), longer channels can even result in more abrupt behavior as shown in the LTP trend, resulting even in non-functional devices in the extreme case of very long and narrow devices.275This has been confirmed by",467

By investigating different orientation distributions (see Fig. S4 in the appendix), it is observable that this asymmetry is directly connected to the orientation distribution observed in MFIS stacks (see Fig. 6.21).

Volltext (PDF).docx,results,"in more abrupt behavior in LTD. Consequently, the orientation distribution is the major driving force between the asymmetry in LTP and LTD behavior, due to the differences in the construction and deconstruction of percolation paths.275 Another major difference between MFM and MFIS devices is the grain size. That this impacts the switching behavior as well can be deduced from Fig. 6.22. Here, the LTP shows overall an increased step size at identical device dimensions for a smaller effective grain size. Consequently, it is detrimental to achieve a fine grain structure in highly scaled devices to further enable analogue switching required for neuromorphic computing.275 While these design considerations are compatible with FEoL integrated FeFETs, design considerations will differ for BEoL integrated FeFETs due to the absence of localized effects of the polarization state on the channel since an electrode is inserted in between.6.2.2 Material and stack influences on synaptic devicesIt has already been demonstrated that the microstructure influences the switching behav-ior due to the formation of current percolation paths. As already discussed in the previous chapter 5, the microstructure is strongly dependent on the crystallization behavior. One method to modify the crystallization temperature of the hafnium oxide layer is the choice of dopant. In previous sections and in literature32,35it is known that HZO has a much lower crystallization temperature compared to HSO. Consequently, as demonstrated in section 5.2.2, the microstructure of the two materials differs. When comparing HZO and HSO layers deposited at 300°C, it can be observed that the HZO film exhibits larger co-ercive fields (see Fig. 6.23a). Previously, differences in coercive field have already been related to the crystallographic texture. Comparing now HZO and HSO based FeFETs, it has already been shown that HZO based devices exhibit a larger MW and lower variability (see section 6.1). Further differences are observable in the synaptic performance. Under identical pulse conditions, it is obvious that the HZO devices shows a strongly improved non-linearity coefficient (see Fig. 6.23b). The dynamic range, on the other hand, is strongly reduced (see Fig. 6.23c). Considering the larger coercive field in HZO, this result is reasonable, since pulse amplitude is further below the coercive field compared to HSO. Consequently, less domains are switching, resulting in a more linear switching process. At the same time, the maximum applied amplitude is not sufficient to switch all domains, thus reducing the accessed effective memory window and therefore the dynamic range.273 Another influence on the switching process during LTP and LTD is the thickness of the hafnium oxide layer. As shown in Fig. 6.23d, thinner layers result in similar non-linearity coefficients. The gate voltage at which LTP and LTD reach the same value is moved to lower voltages. Hence, thinner layers might be of interest for low voltage applications.273 Nevertheless, the scaling of thickness is limited due to the in section 6.1.1 discussed in-crease in depolarization field.105Figure 6.23: Differences in the switching behavior due to the hafnium oxide doping ele-ment and thickness as well as the behavior of highly scaled devices. Differ-ences in the polarization response of HSO and HZO layers are shown in (a). The non-linearity coefficient and dynamic range of HSO and HZO FeFETs are provided in (b) and (c), respectively.

Volltext (PDF).docx,discussion,"s, linear switching behavior with a high number of intermediate states can be achieved even in highly scaled devices, e.g. for 90x90 nm2as depicted in Fig. 6.23e and 6.23f.2736.2.3 Reliability aspects of synaptic devicesWhile the previous sections have focused on the switching behavior in synaptic devices, reliability aspects have to be addressed for synaptic devices as well. While it has already been demonstrated in the sections above that FeFETs fulfill the requirements of a dy-namic range larger 10 to achieve accuracies larger 80%145,163, a symmetric LTP and LTD response (by signal optimization), a very good linearity, and are able to accommodate 32 states (5-bit)145,162,163, other reliability aspects like cycle-to-cycle and device-to-device variability as well as retention are often overlooked161.Retention measurements of the intermediate states in FeFETs clearly predict long term stability with an expected retention of up to 10 years (see Fig. 6.24a).273Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the polarization state retention is not affected significantly by operating at increased temperature (up to 120°C). Due to the pyroelectric properties of the material, however, the polarization value decreases with increasing temperature,106Figure 6.24: Reliability performance of FeFET based synapses. Retention measurements (a) suggest stable retention of intermediate states. Low cycle-to-cycle vari-ation is observed as well (b). The measured device-to-device and die-to-die variability (c) both show low variation of the current states.

In case of writing at elevated temperatures, losses are expected.132,278 In addition, the devices show a good cycle-to-cycle variability as depicted in Fig. 6.24b. Moreover, the device-to-device variability has already been demonstrated to be sufficient previously (see Fig. 6.18b) in a single die of the wafer. Comparing this now with the die-to-die variability across a 300 mm wafer, an increase is observable (see Fig. 6.24c). Nev-ertheless, the distribution is still quite narrow.Figure 6.25: On wafer variability of current and non-linearity coefficient. The current vari-ation at a gate voltage of 1.4 V across a 300 mm wafer after 32 LTP pulses is displayed in (a). The variability of the non-linearity coefficient at a gate voltage of 1.4 V is shown for seq. 1 to 3 in (b). Figures reproduced with permission from: (a,b) ref. 273 IEEE, (c) ref. 274 IEEE.Comparing the lateral distribution across a 300 mm wafer, no crossflow pattern is ob-servable (see Fig. 6.25a). In addition, the non-linearity coefficient shows low variability across the wafer for all three sequences (see Fig. 6.25b). Nevertheless, an increase in variability is observable from seq. 3 to 1. The low variability, even on 300 mm wafers, is advantageous for the integration into industrial CMOS processes.274This has been ad-dressed and summarized elsewhere as well36.107Figure 6.26: Comparison of different non-volatile memories for the application as synap-tic devices.

This has revealed important findings that help to improve and design emerging non-volatile memory and synaptic devices based on ferroelectric hafnium oxide.More specifically, strong evidence is provided that the AFE-like behavior and wake-up effect are related to 90° domain wall movement (ferroelastic switching) and stress relax-ation processes.

In addition, a new effect, namely an electric field-induced crystallization, was discovered in this material system, and a time and con-centration dependent phase diagram visualizing the amorphous-crystalline phase bound-ary is provided. This effect could enable new device architectures and applications due to its unique properties, allowing to precisely define the maximum polarization of the film. By the application of TKD, the microstructure of doped hafnium oxide layers could be resolved, indicating strong influences from the doping concentration, annealing temper-ature and substrate. From this, five phenomenological wake-up behaviors can be in-ferred. While sudden wake-up is the phenomenological representation of the electric field-induced cyrstallization, the ferroelastic switching visualizes itself in different AFE-like and ferroelectric-like behaviors. In the group of AFE-like behaviors, the classical wake-up effect represents the basic behavior of a hafnium oxide film, where the ferroelectric axis is oriented initially in-plane. Moreover, based on the influences of doping element and con-109centration on phase composition and crystallization temperature in combination with the dependence on the annealing temperature, a semi-epitaxial growth window on TiN has been identified, enabling sharp transitions around EC and explaining the phenomenolog-ical behavior of textured AFE-like wake-up.

mulaosmanovic_miko_random_number_generator_EDL_2018.docx,Abstract,"— Hafnium oxide-based ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) have a great potential for fast non-volatile memory due to their high performance, fully CMOS compatible integration, and low-power operation. The aggressive scaling of these devices has revealed novel features, such as the multilevel storage capability and abrupt switching, which, however, appears to be a stochas-tic process. In this letter, we propose a path for true random number generation based on the statistical switching in a single FeFET device. It relies on an inherent randomness of the polarization reversal of ferroelectric domains in the gate stack. The bit sequence is generated by repeatedly programming an FeFET at a calibrated voltage and pulse width, and features random and equiprobable ""ones"" and ""zeros,"" which are separated by orders of magnitude in drain current. This simple yet reliable operation provides a compact one-transistor solution for the unbiased random number generation.Index Terms— Cryptography, ferroelectric FET (FeFET), ferroelectric memory, random number generation (RNG).I.",238

The highest level of ECURE encryption in transmission protocols relies on thesecurity is only ensured when true RNGs are adopted [1].This is due to the fact that, unlike pseudo-RNGs, a trueRNG harnesses an inherent randomness of a certain physicalphenomenon and is therefore externally unpredictable andirreproducible.Many concepts of true RNGs utilizing conventional CMOScircuits have been proposed, exploiting e.g. the random tele-graph noise (RTN) in MOSFETs [2], the thermal noise in com-bination with a jittered oscillator sampling [3], [4], the timeto oxide breakdown under voltage stress [5] etc. However,these techniques require a large circuitry for the process-ing of the random signal and more compact solutions aretherefore preferred.

For instance, the variability in resistive random access memory (RRAM), which repre-sents one of its major weaknesses, is exploited to produce randomness. In fact, random fluctuation of resistance upon RTN [6] or variability of the main parameters (set/reset voltage, resistance in the low and high resistive state) [7] in RRAM devices can be readily used for this purpose. Similarly, the stochastic nature of spin-torque switching in a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) [8], [9] has been proposed for RNGs as well.Among novel nonvolatile memory concepts, ferroelec-tric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) have recently emerged as promising candidates due to their high performance, fully CMOS compatible integration and low-power opera-tion [10], [11]. The aggressive thickness and lateral scaling down to the size of single ferroelectric domains have, how-ever, brought to light novel phenomena such as abrupt and stochastic switching [12]. Such a feature has already opened a path for a potential multi-level storage [13]. In this work, we propose a true RNG based on the switching variability in a single ultra-scaled FeFET device. The clear advantage of this concept lies in its simple 1–transistor (1T) structure, allowing for a compact and highly scalable on-chip true RNG.II.",790
mulaosmanovic_miko_random_number_generator_EDL_2018.docx,RESULTS,"A. Stochastic SwitchingOur FeFET devices comprise a polysilicon − TiN (8 nm)− HfO2 (10 nm) − SiON (1.2 nm) gate stack and are fabricated using the 28 nm high-k metal gate process flow in a conventional gate first approach, as described in [10]. The ferroelectric phase in HfO2 is promoted by a 4 mol% Silicon doping. The channel length and width are 30 nm and 80 nm, respectively.The channel conductivity of a FeFET can be tuned by switching the polarization charge within the ferroelectric. In fact, by applying a positive gate pulse (VG = VP) while grounding all other terminals, the polarization is aligned downward and the device is set into a low-VT state (red curve in Fig. 1a, program operation), where VT is the threshold voltage. A proper negative VN pulse, instead, resets the device into the high-VT state (blue curve in Fig. 1(a), erase operation). The two states are separated by orders of magnitude,0741-3106 © 2017 IEEE.

(b) VG pulse sequence adopted to study the switching from high- to low-VT state consists of 1) initialization program pulse (VP = 4 V, 1 µs); 2) erase pulse (VN = −4 V, 1 µs) to set the reference high-VT state; and 3) program pulse VP = 2.5 V with variable pulse width tPW, which explores the time dependent switching.

This feature may be exploited to store the binaryinformation in a nonvolatile manner [10], [11].The switching behavior from one state to the other depends,however, on the device size. It is well known that FeFETshaving relaxed lateral dimensions (e.g. W = L = 500 nm) show a gradual switching upon a gate excitation with progres-sively increasing pulse width (Fig. 1(b)) [14], [15], as shownin Fig. 1(c). In contrast, our recent report [12] on the aggres-sively scaled devices has revealed an additional switchingFig. 2.

The curve is characterized by three distinct regions, namely, region A where no switching occurs due to the fact that the adopted pulse width and amplitude are insufficient to reverse the polarization; region B where the switching has a certain probability to occur and an oscillatory behavior is registered among trials; and region C, where the switching occurs at every trial, i.e. the switching is deterministic.B. Random Number Generationfeature. Indeed, when the channel length is comparable to theTheprobabilisticferroelectricswitchingobservedinferroelectric domain size and hence the gate stack contains only one or a few switchable domains, the switching becomes extremely sharp, as exemplarily shown in Fig. 1(d) for the transition from high- to low-VT state.Moreover, it was shown that this switching is a stochastic rather than a deterministic process, when the device is excited in the proximity of the ferroelectric coercive voltage. The phenomenon can be easily captured in an",1257

This means the exact switching time is a priori unpredictable. Such a stochastic behavior is attributedregion B of Fig. 2(b) opens a completely new perspective for FeFET devices, reaching beyond their traditional memory application, which is only concerned with region C. Here, we propose to exploit the intrinsic switching variability for the true random number generation.To this purpose, the gate pulse sequence in Fig. 1(b) is used again: after the initialization program pulse, the device is first random program operation is performed by applying a pulse set to a reference high-VT state with VN = −4 V, then a having the pulse width which corresponds to the probability of 50% for switching in Fig. 2(b). For the adopted pulse amplitude of 2.5 V, this pulse width is tPW = 9.1 µs. In this way, the program transition tends to be induced only in half of the trial cycles. Finally, the transfer curve is read-out to assess the resulting VT or the drain current state.MULAOSMANOVIC et al.: RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION BASED ON FERROELECTRIC SWITCHING 137Fig. 3. (a) Drain current levels extracted at VG = 0 V and sampled over 300 consecutive random programming operations using tPW = 9.1 µs as the excitation pulse width. (b) Cumulative distribution plot of the obtained levels showing a bimodal distribution of states and an abrupt separation at P = 0.4867. Wider distribution for low ID is an artifact due to limited measurement resolution. (c) Scatter plot of the drain current ID at cycle i+1 as a function of ID at cycle i indicating the existence of 4 populations (‘00’, ‘01’, ’10, and ‘11’), which are almost evenly represented in the obtained data set.Fig. 3(a) shows the resulting drain current levels sampled over the consecutive 300 random program trials. It can be observed that the obtained bit stream has a binary form, with two current levels being clearly distinguishable and separated by almost two orders of magnitude. This can be understood by the aforementioned abrupt switching of these small devices and by the internal amplification effect inherent to the transistor operation. Consequently, a logical ‘one’ can be attributed to the low-VT , and a logical ‘zero’ to the high-VT state, without adopting an additional circuitry to separate the two states.In order to preliminarily verify the apparent randomness of the obtained bits, we first evaluate whether the events ofrepresented in the set of data (with a probability close to 1/4), which means there is no preferential bit order. Fig. 3(c) shows exemplarily the relative scatter (lag) plot for l = 1. It is namely particularly important for FeFETs to ensure the absence of any correlation between adjacent states (l = 1). In this way, in fact, any kind of memory or imprint effects, which are known to afflict the ferroelectrics, could be excluded.Although this work is primarily concerned with illustrating the novel concept of the FeFET based RNG, further aspects for a reliable and unbiased bit generation are of substantial interest as well. For instance, the stability of the operating point where P = 50%, which might be influenced by cycling or tempera-ture, is essential. In fact, it is known that changes in operating temperature influence the ferroelectric switching [12], which might therefore cause an imbalance between the generated‘ones’ and ‘zeros’. This issue could be overcome by adopting real-time tracking mechanisms, as foreseen for other types of RNGs [9].Finally, note that the bit generation rate can be tuned accord-ing to desired requirements. Considering that a linear increase in gate pulse amplitude leads to an exponential decrease of the switching time in FeFETs [12], the bit generation rate could be considerably increased by adopting a higher operating voltage.III.",923

Zeng_FEFET_trapping_EDL_2019.docx,INTRODUCTION,"F ERROELECTRIC field effect transistor (FeFET) memory is one of the most promising emerging non-volatile memories, with the sign of non-destructive readout, low power consumption, fast write/read speed and Flash-like structure [1]. Recent demonstrations of aggressively scaled planar FeFET and 3D FeFET with HfO2-based ferroelectric thin film (FE-HfO2) have sparked the implementation for embedded and mass storage applications due to the excellent CMOS compatibility, high scalability, and mature manufacturability [2]-[4]. Nevertheless, one potential issue for HfO2-based FeFET memory is its limited endurance, i.e. the memory window (MW) degrading with program/erase (P/E) cycling[5]-[9]. Due to the continuity of electric displacement field, ferroelectric polarization of FE-HfO2 exerts significant electrical field stress on the interface between FE-HfO2 and silicon, which causes severe charge trapping and trap generation [7]. Most works indicated charge trapping is the dominant factor or main driver for the MW degradation [5], [7], [10]-[13], where MW is the difference of threshold voltage (VTH) values between programed Manuscript received xxxx, 2018 and revised xxxx, 2018; accepted xxxx, 2018.

For example, Yurchuk et al. identified that the wear-out of the interface between FE-HfO2 and silicon is responsible for the MW degradation, driven by charge trapping upon the bipolar P/E cycling [5]. Lately, from the point view of P/E read current ratio (the other expression for MW), Gong et al. found that both charge trapping in the gate stack and generation of interface traps (including border traps) contribute to the endurance failure [6]. But a more comprehensive and clear understanding of the evolution of MW closure is required for practical engineering applications, such as the respective effects of charge trapping and interface trap generation, and the different VTH evolutions between programed and erased states with P/E cycling [5], [6], [8]-[10]. Inspired by the significant achievements in clarifying the VTH shift of MOSFETs and revealing the P/E cycling degradation mechanism of Flash memories for practical engineering applications [14]-[18], the midgap voltage method of separating the oxide-trapped charges and interface-trapped charges is employed to clarify their individual contributions to VTH shift and MW degradation of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based FeFETs in this work.

karda_hot_atom_damage_EDL_2016.docx,INTRODUCTION,"C law of transistor scaling. Unfortunately, the supply voltage power (P ∼ V2 D) has been the enduring goal of Moore’s REATING faster transistors that consume very littleVD = SBZ log (R) is fundamentally limited by two factors: the desired ratio of the on-current to off-current, R ≡ Ion/Ioff, and the minimum subthreshold swing (SBZ = 60mV/dec) of a barrier-controlled Boltzmann switch. The inability to scale VD below this fundamental limit makes it difficult to reduce dynamic power of a classical transistor. Moreover, for channel length (LC) ≤ 10nm, the static power (due to gate leakage and DIBL) cannot be reduced either. Therefore, industry now desires a new transistor that operates at lower VD, without sacrificing Ion or R [1].If subthreshold swing (S) could be reduced below SBZ, the desired Ion and R can be achieved at lower VD, and therefore, the conventional tradeoff between performance and power dissipation need not apply. For a classical transistor, S ratio of (positive) gate (CG) and substrate (Csub) capac-= m(CG, Csub) SBZ, with m≥1 depending on theitances. A number of groups have recently explored the intriguing potential of negative capacitors (NC) to amplify the gate voltage (VG) to enable m < 1 and thus achieve S < SBZ [2]–[10].

Several groups have demonstrated that S is dramatically reduced in a FE Landau switch, constrained only by the limits of hysteresis-free (HF) switching needed for logic operation [8].There has been a persistent concern, however, that high Ion in FE Landau switch may not translate to high switching speed (f). In particular the τ used for transistors assumes the intrinsic response time of = CGVD/Ion delay metricCG is limited by Debye relaxation time [11], which is more than order of magnitude smaller compared to τ. Unlike con-ventional gate oxide, the negative capacitance of FE arises from combination of both atomic and electronic movement between two positions of a unit cell, corresponding to the minima of the energy landscape. If this atomic transition is too slow, FE Landau switches would be irrelevant for high-speed logic operation, even if Ion is high. Now,",761
karda_hot_atom_damage_EDL_2016.docx,experiment,"s do show that nanosecond regime switching can be achieved in hysteretic FE memories [12]–[14] at voltages higher than the coercive voltage (V > Vc). However, FE Landau switch operates at ∼ Vc/10 and the voltage drop inside the FE is opposite to externally applied voltage [2]–[10] resulting in electric field inside FE which is opposite to the direction of polarization switching. Since switching time in FE depends strongly on voltage [14] and is only possible in the same direction of electric field inside FE for bistable hysteretic (BH) mode used in FE-memory [12]–[15], it is unclear if sufficiently fast switching can ever be achieved in Landau switches.Although the DC reliability of FE gate stack in a Landau switch can be ensured by restricting the maximum electric field in FE and series DE [10], the AC reliability is still a major concern. It has been validated with detailed characterization in [16] that amongst various mechanisms, the AC reliability is dictated by hot atom damage wherein transient overshoot of the high energy atoms (hot atom) in a FE lead to bond dissociation and the corresponding accumulation of broken bonds which",250

Therefore, it is natural to ask whether Landau switches would be sufficiently reliable, or if they would require soft landing strategies similar to those implemented for FE [16] and NEMS [18]. In this work, we formulate the Landau-Khalatnikov theory for a series coupled FE-DE system (Sec. II) and provide a numerical framework to quantify and benchmark the switching speed (Sec.

karda_hot_atom_damage_EDL_2016.docx,experiment,"s [19]. In essence, LK theory connects the rate of polarization (P) switching to the (negative) gradient of free energy density (F) landscape as follows,Md2P dt2 +LdP dt= −dF dP, (1)where M and L represent the mass density and the damping coefficients, respectively, of the FE atoms switching between the energy minima. A FE Landau switch, however, includes a series combination of FE and a positive dielectric capac-itance, CDE. Eq. (1) is still valid, but the parameters must account for contributions from both capacitors. Since CDE involves fast switching of electronic charges of a typical positive capacitor, M and L are dictated by the slower atomic movement of FE. Moreover, the polarization in FE must equal the charge density on the CDE to ensure charge conservation. With these facts, the total system free energy density (F) can be written asF = y0αP2+y0βP4+P2 2CDE−P×VG (t), (2)where y0 is the FE thickness and α and β are Landau coefficients, such that the first two terms define the energy density stored in the FE-capacitor; the third term is the energy density stored in the series capacitor, CDE, and the final term is the energy density supplied by the time-dependent gate voltage, VG(t). A change in VG forces a transition in P, as expected. Eqs. 1 and 2 are solved self-consistently to evaluate P(t) as VG transitions from 0 to VD. For the Landau switch in Fig. 1, C−1 Cox is a constant dielectric capacitor (usually a thin SiO2 DE= C−1 ox+ C−1 chn, wherelayer to isolate the FE from silicon and achieve a better matching with FE negative capacitance [10]) and Cchn isFig. 2.

Assuming that CDE is approximately constant, the gate stack can be ana-lyzed as a series combination CFE (y0 = 10nm, width = 1μm, length = 50nm) and CDE. We analyze two variants of this basic configuration with identical CFE: (1) For the HF mode, we set CDE = |CFE (min)| = (−2y0α)−1= 0.057F/m2so that ET (P) = Area × F (P) = Area ×A single well defines the total free energy (ET) landscape�2CDE+ P2 2CFE�> 0 for all P at VG = 0 (see Fig. 1a).of entire system, similar to series dielectric capacitor CDE energy (EDE) landscape. With the applied VG ramped from 0 to Vc/10, ET continues to be defined by a single-well energy landscape, but its minima shifts to a polarization consistent with the applied bias (see Fig. 1b). (2) For the BH mode, we set CDE = 10 CFE = 0.57F/m2: now, the positive energy contribution EDE from dielectric capacitor cannot fully com-pensate the FE energy (EFE), so that the ET is characterized by a double-well energy landscape, see Fig. 1c. With the applied VG ramped from 0 to 1.5 ×V c, the polarization transitions between bi-stable states separated by a potential barrier, see Fig. 1d. The LK equation has been used extensively to study the switching/reliability of capacitors configured in the BH mode since the 1980s. Therefore, a comparison of HF vs. BH modes – using the same equations, but with different energy landscapes will allow us to predict the switching/reliability of a non-hysteretic Landau switch in reference to the hysteretic FE switching.In this study, we will use the recently discovered doped-HfO2 as the FE material [10], [12], [14].

The described in [20]. Specifically, P reflects the movement of the four oxygen atoms, as suggested by the first principles calculation [21]. The damping coefficient L is obtained exper-imentally from the characteristic decay time (2M/L) in BH mode operating at voltage V > VC [12].III. SWITCHING TIME: FE-DE SYSTEMFig. 2 summarizes the polarization dynamics associated with HF and BH modes. The devices are switched by ramping VG at 0.5V/ns. The final voltage is 0.1V for HF mode, representative of a low voltage steep slope Landau switch without hystere-sis, and 1.5V for BH mode (representative of FE operated at 1.5 × Vc) to achieve fast switching from one stable state to the other. The time evolution of polarization inKARDA et al.: SWITCHING DYNAMICS AND HAD IN LANDAU SWITCHES 803Fig. 3. Time evolution of voltage drop in FE, DE and applied voltage for (a) HF mode and (c) BH mode; Time evolution of energy in FE, DE and total system energy for (b) HF mode and (d) BH mode.HF and BH mode are shown in Fig.2a and Fig.2b, respec-tively. The switching is gradual and continuous in HF mode, compared to an abrupt fast switching in BH mode. Thus, the switching rate in HF mode Landau switch is slower compared to that in the BH mode. However, the total change in P needed for a FE Landau switch is smaller than that of the HF mode [2]–[6]. This smaller polarization swing for a Landau switch can be achieved in a time comparable to that needed to switch from one stable state to the other in BH mode. Thus, although FE Landau switches have inherently degraded time response of polarization, the net switching time of the FE Landau switch is comparable to FE switching time in BH mode, even though Landau switch operates at 1/15 the voltage of a BH switch. Since the HfO2 based FE systems with switching times in the nanosecond (ns) regime have already been demonstrated in BH mode [12], we conclude that the HfO2 based FE Landau switches can achieve similar time-response, and therefore, are relevant for logic switches operating in ns regime. However the ultra-high performance (picoseconds) is still constrained by the inherent material switching limits in BH mode.IV. ENERGY DYNAMICS: FE-DE SYSTEMTo understand the AC reliability of HF vs. BH modes, we compare their energy dynamics, as VG is ramped at 0.5V/ns. For HF mode, the time evolution of voltage across FE (VFE), the voltage drop across series dielectric capacitor DE (VDE), and the total applied voltage (VA) are shown in Fig. 3a. Similarly, the time evolution of EFE, EDE, and ET are shown in Fig.3b. The corresponding evolution of voltages and energies for BH mode are shown in Fig.3c and Fig.3d, respectively.For the HF mode, Fig.3b shows that the system switches even though EFE increases with time, because the faster decrease in EDE ensures that the overall ET (red line) is reduced, so that the switching is energetically favorable. Note that ET changes gradually with VG(t), implying that the system is stabilized at all intermediate energy steps (soft switching). As a result, the overshoot in polarization (and correspondingly that of EFE) is negligibly small. In contrast, as seen in Fig.3d, the energy in BH mode changes abruptlyonce the energy supplied by external field is high enough to surpass the intrinsic barrier. At this point the system is highly out of equilibrium, causing a significant overshoot in polarization. The polarization overshoots, owing to increased energy of the stretched bond lead to exponential increase in the probability of bond dissociation and hence defect density generation rate (d NT /dt). These defects accumulate over time resulting in increased leakage [17] through the FE. As a result, the AC lifetime of the FE (defined as time to reach a critical defect density NBD and corresponding threshold leakage) accordingly degrades with increasing number of cycles. This HAD related reliability for BH mode dictates the AC reliability of FE as shown in [16]. The extensive characterization in [16] has validated that the schemes which reduce polarization overshoots (for example, through reduced ramp rate and increased series external resistance) improve the HAD induced AC reliability by orders of magnitude. The total energy change in HF mode is 12× smaller than that of the BH mode, and the peak energy overshoot in HF mode is 3.2× lower than in BH mode. Thus, this reduced overshoot should make Landau switches significantly more robust to HAD induced reliability degradation compared to a FE-memory (operating in BH mode). Unlike the strategies adopted in [16], the reduction in the energy overshoot of a Landau switch is intrinsic to the stabilization of the system in single well energy landscape.V.",1159

T14_3[1].docx,Introduction,"The next-generation non-volatile memory (NVM) requires low operating voltage and fast speed to save switching power (PS) for high-density memory application. However, further VD and PS reductions in a MOSFET are limited by the fundamental transistor physics of 60 mV/decade subthreshold swing (SS). The steep SS property not only lowers the PS but also reduces the DC off-state leakage (Ioff), as shown in Fig. 1. One proposed solution is to adopt ferroelectric MOSFET with a steep SS lower than 60 mV/dec [1]. However, a weak ferroelectric polarization at a scaled thickness is not sufficient to prevent performance degradation on memory window, data retention and high-temperature endurance [2], [3]. In this work, we proposed a 1T versatile memory with combining storage mechanisms of ferroelectricity (FE) and charge trapping (CT) to simultaneously reach sub-60 mV/dec operation and fast write/erase speed for power saving. The memory behaviors improved by excellent subthreshold performance are also investigated. Device Fabrication The p-MOSFETs using ferroelectric HfZrO (HZO) and charge-trapped ZrSiO (ZSO) dielectrics were fabricated. A 3.5-nm dry oxide was grown on Si as buffer layer, followed by HZO (22.5nm) and ZSO (7nm) film deposition and 400oC annealing. Subsequently, the 3.5-nm SiO2 was covered as a tunnel oxide.

T14_3[1].docx,Discussion,"Fig. 2 shows the orthorhombic crystallization of nanoscale FE-HZO responsible for ferro-domains switch. In Fig. 3, a VT shift (ΔVT) of 1.2 V, minimum SS (SSmin) of 58 mV/dec, and Ion/Ioff ratio of 108 are measured in FE-HZO MOSFET with ±6 V bias sweep. To further improve memory performance, we employ a versatile memory integrating a CT node (ZSO) into FE-HZO. As shown in Fig. 4, the extra aligned dipoles formed near ZSO/HZO interface add toward the polarization electric field at the same drive voltage. The well-behaved ID-VD and ID-VGare shown in Fig. 5 (inset: TEM image of gate stack). Under ±6 V bias sweep, a 3V ΔVT window, an ultralow Ioff of ~10-15A/μm, and a large Ion/Ioff ratio of >109 are achieved. The large ΔVT window with various gate bias (Fig. 6) due to strong polarization enhancement facilitates multi-level operation and high-temperature endurance.

T14_3[1].docx,results,"(Fig. 8) fitted to ID-VG curve, the surface potential gain (dΨs/dVG) >1 is confirmed. The m factor possibly becomes smaller than 1 to reach low SS (<60mV/dec) when 1T versatile NVM shows a negative capacitance effect [1] and dΨs/dVG >1. As for low SS property (Fig. 9), the <60mV/dec SS are measured at a wide VD range from 0.1 to 0.5V, and also reveals the decrease of SS with downscaling of channel length. Fig. 10 presents max. ΔVT of 2.8V under 20 ns pulse and pulse-dependent ΔVT at ±4V. The ΔVT window triggered by faster 20ns speed (inset) shows very slight degradation in comparison with DC sweep mode, which verifies a reliable switching response between ferroelectric domain and charge trapping. Although gate-injection charge tunneling may affect P/E speeds, faster pico-sec ferroelectric domain switching raises the speed up to ns level. Regarding sub-50ns P/E speeds, the measured ΔVT window of 1.9~2.1V are much larger than the saturated 0.3~0.4V of 1T FeNVM. Notably, a favorably low overdrive voltage (VG-VT) of <3V with a steep SS still provides a ΔVT window of 1.3V that is much better than that (0.9V ΔVT at ±4V) of FinFET DRAM with the best SSmin of 109 mV/dec [4]. We further evaluate the cycling endurance (Fig. 11). The versatile memory shows no significant degradation in ΔVT window with endurance beyond 1012 cycles even at higher 85oC. Since VT is sensitive to ferroelectric capacitance effect, a preferred read scheme adopting Ion/Ioff ratio to define sense margin is also tested. As shown in Fig. 12, sub-60mV/dec SS (m<1) can stabilize Ion/Ioff ratio (Ioff ∝10-VT/SS) and ΔVT due to low subthreshold leakage (Isubth ∝exp(VG/mVT)) to reach low drive voltage, uniform switch and long endurance. In Fig. 13, a stable and large Ion/Ioff ratio of ~107 is shown to exceed 1012 P/E cycles at 25oC. Furthermore, only slightly degraded Ion/Ioff (~106) is retained after extrapolation to 1016 cycles at 85oC. The extremely long endurance and high speed close to DRAM and sub-pJ switching energy like Flash NVM demonstrates the great potential for high-density & energy-efficient memory application. The high-temperature data retention is shown in Fig. 14. The improved retention of 103s at 85oC in versatile memory is superior to FeNVM, which can be ascribed to interface aligned dipoles, resisting depolarization field to delay retention time. Since the retention behavior is dominated by slow charge tunneling in CT layer, a long retention is expected by increasing ZSO thickness to enhance ferroelectric polarization stability.

However, such small devices are inevitably sensible to the granularity of the polycrystalline gate oxide film. Here we report for the first time the evidence of single ferroelectric (FE) domain switching in such scaled devices. These properties are sensed in terms of abrupt threshold voltage (VT) shifts leading to stable intermediate VT levels.

The difference of the two VTs defines the cell’s memory window (MW) as depicted in Fig. 3. In order to investigate the effect of FE polarization switching on VT and MW, the waveform of Fig. 4 is adopted for VG: after initial 100 bipolar cycles for device preconditioning [3], follows the sequence of Reference Erase pulse, defining the high reference VT state, and a variable Program pulse, increasing in 50 mV steps. Evidence of single domain switching: Fig. 5 shows exemplarily the evolution of the VT level for both PRG and ERS incremental gate pulse sweeps and fixed Reference levels: two clear discrete VT jumps are observed only at certain VG values. These steps indicate abrupt polarization switching of two distinct FE domains within the HfO2 film occurring at intrinsically different coercive fields (EC). Fig. 6 extends this analysis for different combinations of reference and incremental writing pulses for the same cell. Three significant traces for different reference pulses are highlighted in Fig. 6b) showing that the occurrence of VT jumps depend on the initial VT state determined by the reference pulse: if Ref ERS is large enough to back-switch both domains inducing the highest VT state, their switching into the low VT state will be visible during the incremental PRG sweep (upper trace); otherwise, when one or both domains are not back-switched (middle and lower trace, respectively), only one or no VT jumps will be observed. Fig. 7 depicts the resulting MW dependence on PRG and ERS voltage, which is calculated from Fig. 6c) by subtracting the reference erase VT value from each point along the program traces. Obviously, three distinct MW regions can be distinguished, corresponding to none (blue), one (light-blue) and both (red) domains switched. The two stars indicate the minimum PRG and ERS voltages, above which the individual domains can be switched. Further strengthening of our hypothesis is given by TCAD simulations: Fig. 8 illustrates the implemented 2D-FeFET structure, the gate stack comprising two distinct FE domains with different EC in the adopted Preisach model.

Multi-level cell capability: Fig. 9a) shows the VT vs. VGcurves for both ERS and PRG incremental pulse sweeps with distinct intermediate VT levels. The feasibility to set the cell into two separate VT levels is demonstrated by applying VG voltages as indicated by the vertical lines (-4.5V and -4.85V), starting always from the low VT state (PRG at +4V). The procedure is repeated 50 times. Fig.s 9 b) and c) show ID-VG curves and cumulative distributions, respectively, of the corresponding three VT states, indicating a very low cycle-to-cycle variability. Moreover, the cycling test with a pulse width of 500 ns shown in Fig. 10 reveals more than 10 5 endurance cycles with clearly separated three states. In addition, retention characterization was performed at room temperature and obviously no VT jumps are visible in Fig. 11, indicating that the polarization states of the single domains are stable and the slight gradual VT drift originates most probably from de-trapping of parasitic charges. The cumulative distribution of the first VT jump of 60 cells is represented in Fig. 12 for both ERS and PRG sweeps. It is clear that most of the domains can be switched below 4V and |-5V|. A similar distribution is obtained for L=90 nm FeFET as well, which however has more polycrystalline grains and hence more FE domains, and consequently more VT jumps, as shown in Fig. 13. Film engineering: The variability of switching voltages can be explained by a surface energy effect on the transition barrier for polarization reversal, which depends on the grain size [4], doping and furthermore on grain orientation. In the top-view TEM image of an 80nm x 30nm device in Fig. 14a) four HfO2 grains with varying sizes can be clearly distinguished. Fig. 14b) depicts the top-view SEM image of the HfO2 film, from which the grain size distribution is extracted. Correlating this distribution and the voltage jump distribution of Fig. 12 the relation in Fig. 15 is obtained. Therefore, the key for the MLC capability optimization of FeFET devices towards low switching voltages is the engineering of polycrystalline films. Various CMOS compatible processing conditions impact the MW as depicted in Fig. 16.",502

Hence recent observa-tions of ferroelectric behavior of hafnia thin films (when doped with Si, Zr, Y, Al, or Gd) [1–7] are rather surprising as ferroelectricity requires the presence of switchable spon-taneous electrical polarization. The emergence of nonpolar hafnia—as a linear high dielectric constant (or high-κ) successor to SiO2—for use in modern electronic devices (e.g., field-effect transistors) is now well established [8,9]. If the origins of this unexpected ferroelectricity can be understood and appropriately harnessed, hafnia-based materials may find applications in nonvolatile memories and ferroelectric fieldPACS number(s): 77.84.−s, 77.65.−j, 81.05.ZxThese",275

We show that this can indeed be accomplished and ascertained, for the example of hafnia, in two steps. First, a computation-based structure search method, e.g., the minima-hopping method [10–12], is used to identify low-energy phases at various pressures and temperatures. Then, ferroelectric phases are singled out by applying the group theoretical symmetry reduction principles, established by Shuvalov for ferroelectricity [13]. These principles al-low for the systematic identification of all possible lower symmetry proper ferroelectric phases that can result fromOur density functional theory (DFT) [20,21] calculations were performed with the ABINIT package [22,23], employ-ing the norm-conserving Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter pseu-dopotentials [24] and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation energies functional [25]. Highly accurate DFT energies EDFT were ensured by dense Monkhorst-Pack k-point meshes [26], and a basis set of plane waves with kinetic energy up to 1100 eV. Convergence is assumed when the residual forces and stresses are smaller than 10−3eV/˚A and 10−5eV/˚A3, respectively. As given in the Supplemental Material [27], the lattice parameters obtained by optimizing for the previously known phases of hafnia agree very well with",372
Rampi_HfO2_PRB_2014.docx,experiment,"al data, implying that our computational scheme ishigher-symmetry nonpolar prototype (parent) phases. reasonable.Using this approach, we find two ferroelectric phases of hafnia, belonging to the Pca21 and Pmn21 orthorhom-bic space groups, which are close in free energy with the known nonpolar equilibrium phases of hafnia over a wide temperature and pressure range. Figure 1(a) displays the computed equilibrium phase diagram of hafnia indicating the regimes at which the known nonpolar phases are stable. This includes the low-temperature low-pressure P21/c monoclinic phase, high-pressure Pbca and Pnma orthorhombic phases, and the high-temperature P42/nmc tetragonal phase (the high-temperature Fm3m cubic aristotype is not shown).Given that the ferroelectricity was observed [1–7] in doped hafnia thin films, and that pressure is theoretically predicted [28] to play an important role in stabilizing the Pca21 polar phase, we systematically searched for low-energy structures at pressures up to 30 GPa. In the minima-hopping method [10–12], used for our search, the DFT energy landscape of hafnia is explored by performing consecutive short molecular-dynamics steps, traveling across local minima, progressing towards the global minimum. The initial velocities of the molecular-dynamics trajectories were chosen to lay approximately along soft mode directions, improving the efficiency of the method. Local geometry optimizations werethen used to obtain the equilibrium structure.

The eleven lowest-energy cases included six nonpolar and five polar phases. The six non-polar phases were the previously known P21/c monoclinic, P42/nmc tetragonal, Pbca and Pnma orthorhombic, and Fm3m cubic phases, as well as the recently predicted P21/m monoclinic phase [33]; the five polar phases were the Pca21 and Pmn21 orthorhombic, Pm and Cc monoclinic, and the P1 triclinic phases. Phonon band structure calculations, performed at zero temperature and various finite pressures up to 30 GPa using the linear response method [34,35], reveal that with the two exceptions of Fm3m and P21/m, the remaining structures are dynamically stable across the entire pressure range. The high-temperature Fm3m cubic structure is dynamically unstable within the whole pressure range exam-ined, and the P21/m structure is dynamically stable only below 15 GPa. Above this pressure, the P21/m structure collapses to the P42/nmc tetragonal structure (as ascertained by following the unstable phonon modes). More detailed crys-tallographic information, simulated x-ray diffraction patterns, and phonon frequency spectra of the examined structures are given in the Supplemental Material [27].From the calculated phonon band structures, free energies F were computed within the harmonic approximation for the dynamically stable structures. These are shown in Fig. 2 for four different temperatures across the entire pressure range considered. As established previously [15,16,18,19], we found that the P21/c, Pcba, and Pnma phases are thermodynamically stable below 10 GPa, between 10 GPa and 20 GPa, and above 20 GPa, respectively.

Data is given by symbols while curves are guides to the eye. Data corresponding to the Pm, Cc, and P1 phases are not shown as they are energetically unfavorable by roughly 250 meV/atom compared with the other phases.Next, we consider the predicted non-centrosymmetric hafnia phases, i.e., phases whose point groups do not contain an inversion operation. We note that of the five cases identified, the two orthorhombic phases Pca21 and Pmn21 are energetically competing with the equilibrium phases, while the Pm, Cc, and P1 phases are unfavorable by roughly 250 meV/atom compared to the other phases. Figure 1(b) identifies the temperature and pressure regimes at which the Pca21 and Pmn21 phases are extremely close in free energy (<kBT /5) to the corresponding equilibrium phases. Indeed, the Pca21 orthorhombic phase has been observed in zirconia doped with Mg, Ca, and Y [38–41] and recently suggested [28,42] to be a low-energy polar phase of both hafnia and zirconia. The other four phases, i.e., Pmn21, Pm, Cc, and P1, are identified in this work.According to Shuvalov [13], the point symmetry mm2 displayed by Pca21 and Pmn21 phases, the point sym-metry m displayed by Pm and Cc phases, and the point symmetry 1 displayed by P1 phase, are three ferroelectric subgroups of the 4/mmm tetragonal point group. In fact, the symmetry requirements placed on ferroelectric phases that can result from a parent nonpolar phase through distortions are quite definitive. For instance, starting from a tetragonal prototype phase with point symmetry 4/mmm, ferroelectric orthorhombic phases of only two types with point symmetry mm2 (each of them accompanied by a definite polar axis) are possible. These principles suggest that the P42/nmc tetragonal phase of hafnia is the parent nonpolar phase for all identified polar phases. Indeed, we found that all five non-centrosymmetric structures considered herein can be obtainedby distorting the P42/nmc tetragonal structure appropriately. Two most interesting cases, the Pca21 and Pmn21 orthorhom-bic structures, can be obtained by distorting the P42/nmctetragonal structure along its [110] and [100] directions,constructed from the calculated F, summarizes these findings. respectively.064111-2PATHWAYS TOWARDS FERROELECTRICITY IN HAFNIAFIG. 3.

Dark yellow and red spheres represent hafnium and oxygen atoms, respectively, while green spheres locate the center of symmetry of those which are centrosymmetric.In order to better appreciate our findings within the context of Shuvalov’s symmetry-reduction principles, we show in Fig. 3 all the predicted low-energy phases of hafnia identified by our structure-search scheme, classified in terms of their symmetry. The right branch of Fig. 3 shows the five identified polar phases (grouped in terms of their point symmetries)PHYSICAL REVIEW B 90, 064111 (2014)emerging from the prototype P42/nmc tetragonal phase. For completeness, we also display the nonpolar phases on the left branch of Fig. 3. The highest symmetry phase at the top of the figure is the Fm3m cubic phase. Successive symmetry reduction leads to the P42/nmc tetragonal phase, the high-pressure Pcba and Pnma orthorhombic phases, and, finally, the ground-state P21/c monoclinic phase and the recently predicted P21/m monoclinic phase [33].We now consider just the polar Pca21 and Pmn21 or-thorhombic phases, and investigate the magnitude and switch-ability of the polarization. Taking the P42/nmc tetragonal phase as the reference, the spontaneous polarization was computed (through the evaluation of the Berry phase at T = 0 K [43,44]) to be PPca21 = 52 μC/cm2and PPmn21 = 56 μC/cm2pointing along the [001] and [100] directions, re-spectively (the [001] direction of the Pca21 phase corresponds to the [110] direction of the prototype P42/nmc phase). Our calculated spontaneous polarization is in good agreement with",1224

For each of these phases, there are two topologicallyequivalent variants with opposite polarization, referred to as“up” and “down” states. These variants can be obtained by de-forming the prototype P42/nmc structure along two opposite directions (see Fig. 4 for an illustration). We parametrized the continuous deformation from the up to the down states by λ, a parameter scaled to range from −1 to 1. The minimum (DFT) energy pathways describing the deformation leading to the Pca21 and Pmn21 phases, calculated using the generalized solid-state nudged elastic band method [45], are shown in Fig. 4. As expected, these pathways go through the P42/nmc tetragonal phase at their centers (λ = 0) before reaching the opposite polarization state. The curvatures of the calculated pathways at λ = 0 are very small, indicating that although the tetragonal phase is dynamically stable, it corresponds to a very shallow minimum of the energy landscape (the corresponding phonon soft modes can be observed in the Supplemental Material [27]).",310

We note in particular that the P42/nmc phase may be stabilized by some suitable combination of stress and/or internal/external electric field, e.g., by chemical doping or by fabrication of strain-engineered thin film structures [9,46]. In Fig. 5 we tentatively sketch possible pathways which may enable the formation of polar phases even in pure hafnia. These pathways include several processes. First, the P42/nmc tetragonal phase may be stabilized under suitable conditions, e.g., T ≃ 2200 K at ambient pressure or T ≃ 1800 K at P ≃ 10 GPa. Next, perturbations, e.g., via an electric field, could drive the P42/nmc phase to a ferroelectric phase, either Pca21 or Pmn21. Finally, samples may be quenched to lower temperatures and pressures, preserving the obtained polar phases.In summary, we have systematically identified possible ferroelectric phases of hafnia from first principles by com-StabilizingT > 2200 KT > 1800 KP > 10 GPaTetragonal (P42/nmc) PolarizingOrthorhombic Orthorhombic (Pca21)(Pmn21)QuenchingOrthorhombic Orthorhombic (Pca21)(Pmn21)FIG. 5.

Suman_Sumeet_InMemory_IEDM_2018.docx,INTRODUCTION,"In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), the ubiquity of sensors and the continuous flow of data streams require sensor data fusion and processing in real time to discover patterns for predictive analytics. Statistical correlation detection is one approach to extract the global information distributed among the sensor signals. A key application of statistical correlation is the detection of physiological anomalies for distributed health monitoring in the form of wearable devices (Fig.1). Anomalies can be detected based on the correlation among different physiological signals (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, etc.). The correlation between the sensors change in accordance with a person’s health condition (highly correlated when anomaly occurs). In order to process large streams of data in real time, an energy-efficient hardware accelerator suitable for edge device is necessary. In the conventional Von-Neumann approach, sensor data is loaded from the memory buffer into the computation unit which computes the distance norm between the data stream (correlation as one type of distance norm). Clustering algorithms (such as K-means clustering) are then applied to classify the data based on the calculated distance. This approach involves substantial data movement between the memory and the arithmetic logic unit, limiting the throughput and energy efficiency (Fig.2(a)), often called the von Neumann bottleneck. On the other hand, the in-memory computing approach exploits the physical dynamics of emerging memories to perform the computation within the memory with co-located computation and storage (Fig.2(b)) [2]. In the case of correlation detection with FeFET, each signal is associated with an exclusive memory cell. The signal data is fed to an encoder, which translates the correlation among signals to the rate of the pulse applied to the FeFET cells. As a result, only cells associated with highly correlated signals receive frequent pulse update, whose ferroelectric polarization accumulates and eventually switches the total polarization along with the FeFET conductance. Thus, a conductance read can differentiate between the correlated and uncorrelated signals, thereby detecting the anomaly. In this work, we apply statistical correlation detection to detect physiological anomaly from physiological signal streams based on an industrial 28nm HKMG FeFET technology, using the spatial-temporal polarization switching dynamics of ferroelectrics (FE).

Suman_Sumeet_InMemory_IEDM_2018.docx,results,"from the polarization accumulation properties of the ferroelectric when exposed to identical consecutive pulses with amplitudes below the coercive voltage threshold. It involves two physical processes, domain nucleation and domain growth (Fig.3). When sub-coercive field pulses are applied to the FE, a critical number of pulses are required for the reverse domain nuclei to be stabilized. The polarization remains unchanged until the domain reaches the critical nuclei size, beyond which the domain growth happens. When integrated into the gate stack of the FeFET, the polarization accumulation in FE manifests as a shift in the device threshold voltage (VTH) and conductance accumulation characteristics. We first measure the polarization accumulation in an MFM capacitor. Fig.4 shows the measured QFE-VFE hysteresis loops, which exhibit a saturation loop and non-saturated minor loops. Fig.5(a-c) show the polarization accumulation with the number of consecutive pulses for varying pulse amplitude, pulse width, and inter-pulse delay. A modified pulsed measurement (PUND) is used to measure the switched polarization by the accumulation pulses. The",231
Suman_Sumeet_InMemory_IEDM_2018.docx,results,"show that the reduction of either pulse amplitude or pulse width increases the required pulse number for domain nucleation [3]. Moreover, the reduction in the amount of switched polarization with longer inter-pulse delay suggests polarization relaxation between the pulses. This is because the interaction from the unswitched domains switches back the flipped domain, as discussed later. To understand the voltage and time dependent domain nucleation and growth, we solve the time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) equation in a phase-field framework (Fig.6) [4]. We consider the domain-domain interactions across the cross-section (x-y plane) via the Laplacian of polarization (P), which can be interpreted as an interaction field (EINTR). In addition, we account for the random fluctuations in P switching due to thermal processes using an effective thermal field EACCU, which increases with pulse number. The total effective field (EEFF) in the ferroelectric is a sum of the applied external field (EAPP), and the internal EINTR and EACCU. The latter two fields are self-consistently updated in our simulations at each time step as polarization switching causes field redistribution (Fig.6). The interactions between these different terms leads to domain nucleation and growth. The phase field model is calibrated with the measured QFE-VFE hysteresis loop showing an acceptable match (Fig.7). Simulated polarization accumulation in a 200nmx200nm MFM capacitor (10000 domains) is shown in Fig.8. The simulation reproduces the measured accumulation characteristics, such as the delayed onset of polarization increase with the reduction in pulse amplitude and pulse width, and the increase in inter-pulse delay. Fig.9 shows the simulated spatial-temporal evolution of polarization distribution in the FE for different pulse numbers. It exhibits two stages for polarization accumulation. In the initial stage, when the reverse domain volume is smaller than the critical size (10nmx10nm in simulation), increasing number of pulses yields larger thermal fluctuations due to dissipative processes associated with polarization switching. This raises EACCU and EEFF, increasing the probability of reverse domain nucleation and stabilization. The second stage involves domain growth from the nucleation site, which propagates to the whole grain until a grain boundary is encountered. This process is mainly driven by EAPP and EINTR. The polarization relaxation is attributed to EINTR from the surrounding unswitched domains as polarizations from different domains tend to align with each other. For scaled MFM cap (20nmx20nm, 100 domains), the polarization accumulation exhibits abrupt switching due to small number of domains in switching process (Fig.10). B.Conductance Accumulation Characteristics of FeFET Conductance accumulation and threshold behavior is characterized on an 28 nm HKMG FeFET platform [1]. The device cross-sectional TEM images show a poly-Si/TiN/Si:HfO2/SiON/p-Si gate stack (Fig.11(a)). Conductance response to input gate pulses are characterized for FeFETs with W/L=450/450nm (Fig.11(b-f)) and W/L=72/34nm (Fig.11(g-k)). Figs.11(b-c, g-h) show the erased state ID-VG characteristics with progressively increasing erase voltage amplitudes. Polarization switching decreases the device VTH, increasing the channel conductance. Compared with the large device, which shows continuous VTH shift, the scaled FeFET shows an abrupt VTH decrease. This is consistent with the phase field modeling and related with single/few domain switching in scaled FeFETs [3]. The number of domains in scaled device is small enough such that single/few domain switching is evident, whereas it is averaged out by the large number of domains for large device. The conductance accumulation characteristics for different pulse amplitudes, pulse widths and pulse delays are shown in Fig.11(d-f, i-k). Similar to the erase amplitude dependence, the increase of the number of consecutive pulses cause a continuous shift in conductance for the large FeFET, while the scaled device displays an abrupt conductance increase. The conductance accumulation characteristics reflect the domain nuclei stabilization and growth processes shown in Fig.9. For scaled device, the threshold number of pulses required for domain nucleation is exponentially dependent on the applied pulse amplitude and pulse width (Fig.11(i,j)), consistent with the nucleation physics [5]. Unlike MFM cap, the inter-pulse delay has a negligible effect on the accumulation characteristic of FeFET. This is likely due to the depolarization field in FeFET, which causes fast polarization relaxation at timescale less than 10s. Therefore, the increase in delay from 10s to 1ms does not have any effect. The pulse width can be decreased to as low as 50 ns for a pulse amplitude of 3.0V, indicating high speed operation of FeFET. C.Statistical Correlation Detection The polarization accumulation properties of the FeFET are applied to detect anomalies in physiological signals (for scaled geometry, multiple FeFETs are combined as a single device to have continuous accumulation characteristics). The gate pulse encoder translates the correlation among signals to the pulse rate(Fig.12). A stochastic translator (STR) is used to translate real value signals into random binary bit streams so that the multiplication operation can be greatly simplified [6]. At each time instance, the collected momentum is calculated (sum of all the signals) and a MUX is used to achieve multiplication operation necessary for correlation calculation. The physiological signals of patient 221 from the MIMIC database show three anomalies (Fig.13(a)) [7]. By translating the real signals to gate pulses to FeFET, a conductance read can differentiate the anomalies from normal signals reliably as the anomalies are highly correlated among different signals. A majority voting on the number of FeFET conductance over the threshold identifies the anomaly faithfully. Fig.13(b) shows that detection based on 3 signals cause information loss while in the case of 7 signals the detection is successful as more global information is extracted. An array level implementation with the FeFET cells is shown in Fig. 14. Compared with a CMOS ASIC based counter [8] or PCM cell [2], FeFET exhibits high speed, large Gmax/Gmin ratio and low write energy (Fig.15).",1405

Suman_IWO_IEDM_2020.docx,Introduction,"Billions of connected edge devices produce zettabytes of data per year that need to be transformed into actionable information. This has created an unprecedented demand for data-centric computing. With on-chip memory limited by SRAM size, there is an extraordinary volume of data traffic between processor and off-chip memory that adds to energy and latency. Compute-in-memory (CIM) is a promising approach to overcome memory bottleneck where compute is moved closer to the data residing in the memory. Embedded non-volatile memory (eNVM) technologies such as FeFET [1], RRAM [2] and STT-MRAM [3] are candidates for storing the weight matrix on-chip and for performing vector-matrix-multiplication (VMM) in-situ to accelerate deep neural network (DNN) inference. Conventional CIM architecture co-locates eNVM and access transistors in the FEOL along with CMOS logic and periphery like MUX, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in the FEOL. M3D CIM architecture targets placement of the memory array in the BEOL with CMOS periphery under the array (CUA) (Fig. 1(a)). Such M3D CIM accelerator provides significant area, energy and latency advantage [4]. Here, we demonstrate a BEOL compatible FeFET that is monolithically integrated on top of FEOL silicon NMOS to realize high-density 3D synaptic array (Fig. 1(b)). While 1T-1RRAM and 1T-1MRAM require large FEOL access transistors resulting in 30-60F2 bit cell area [2-3], M3D 1T-1FeFET bit cell occupies only 15F2, providing a huge density advantage. Additionally, the low write and read energy of BEOL FeFET provides an energy-efficiency benefit when compared to SRAM and other eNVM technologies (Fig. 1(c)). In this work, we demonstrate BEOL compatible low thermal budget processing and integration of HZO with amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) channel. IWO is preferred as the AOS channel material for FeFET owing to its high field-effect electron-mobility[5,6]under low thermal budget processing compared to poly-Si, absence of unwanted low-k interfacial layer formed between the Si interface and the HZO. Recently HZO has been integrated with BEOL compatible IGZO channel [7], however, IWO offers better improved VT stability due to higher oxygen-bond dissociation energy of W that acts as both stabilizer and electron donor [8].

tokumitsu_FeMFET_JJAP_2001.docx,Introduction,"Recently, ferroelectric-gate field-effect-transistors (FETs)1–4)have attracted much attention for nonvolatile memory applications.. Using ferroelectric-gate FETs, one-transistor-cell type nonvolatile ferroelectric ran- dom access memory (FeRAM) can be obtained and the ferroelectric-gate FETs obey the scaling rule for high-density implementation.. Furthermore, in such “transistor-type” FeRAMs, the stored data can be read out nondestructively.. In addition, we have proposed the use of ferroelectric-gate FETs in neural network systems as analog memories to store synaptic weights.5)We have also fabricated a neuron chip with a Pt/SrBi2Ta2O9/Si ferroelectric-gate FET and a pulse oscillation circuit, and demonstrated an “adaptive-learning”function.6) To fabricate ferroelectric-gate FETs, ferroelectric materials have to be deposited on silicon substrates.. Such a device is called a metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor (MFS) FET, How-ever, preparation of the ferroelectric/Si structure with good interface properties is extremely difficult.. When ferroelectric SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) is directly grown on Si by the sol-gel tech-nique, a relatively thick (7–9 nm) transition layer, which is probably an SiO2 layer with poor electrical properties, can be unintentionally formed.7)Hence, it is a common technique to insert an insulating buffer layer between the ferroelectric ma-terial and Si to improve the interface properties.. Such a struc-ture is called a metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MFIS) structure.. Another structure for ferroelectric gate FETs is a metal-ferroelectric-metal-insulator-semiconductor (MFMIS) structure, where a metal is additionally inserted be-tween the ferroelectric and insulating layers.. The MFMIS structure has a merit that the area of an MFM ferroelectric capacitor (SF) and that of an MIS diode (SM) can be inde-pendently designed..",512

Accumulation and inversion capacitances as a function of the data retention time for the MFM-MIS structure when (a) small and (b) large voltages are applied for programming.the total voltage applied to the MFM-MIS structure is swept from +4.7 to −5.4 V, the estimated electric field applied to the SBT film is approximately 150 kV/cm. Hence, from the P–E hysteresis shown in Fig. 1(a), an almost saturated hys-teresis loop is used in the measured MFM-MIS structures.Using this MFM-MIS structure, we measured the data retention characteristics with different programming volt-ages. Figure 3 shows the accumulation and inversion ca-pacitances as a function of the data retention time for the same MFM-MIS structure when small (50 kV/cm) and large (200 kV/cm) voltages are applied for programming. The de-polarization fields during the data retention are estimated to be 20 kV/cm and 25 kV/cm in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respec-tively. It is found that when the programming voltage is small, the capacitance change decreases rapidly with time and be-comes almost zero after 200 s. On the other hand, the data retention characteristics can be significantly improved by us-ing a large programming voltage even though the depolariza-tion fields during the data retention are about the same for both cases. This result suggests that saturated P–E hystere-sis is much more stable than a minor P–E loop when the ferroelectric capacitor is reversely biased (i.e., under depolar-ization field). Hence, it is important to use a saturated P–E hysteresis loop of the ferroelectric layer to obtain a long data retention time.3. Simulation and Design of Ferroelectric-Gate FETsTo design the MFMIS-FETs, the operation voltage and memory windows should be determined. From our previous work, it is reported that a subthreshold swing of the Pt/SBT/Pt/STA/SiON MFMIS-FETs is about Hence, to obtain the drain current 200–250 mV/decade.on-off ratio larger than 5 orders of magnitude, the memory window of the MFMIS-FET should be larger than 1.25 V. In this section, we assume the MFMIS structures to obtain a memory window of more than 1.5 V with an operation volt-age of less than 5 V. We numerically simulated the transistor characteristics of MFIS and MFMIS-FETs using ferroelec-tric SBT films by Miller’s model.16)In the simulations, spon-taneous polarization PS, remanent polarization Pr, coercive field EC, and relative dielectric constant εr of the SBT films are assumed to be 13 µC/cm2, 11.5 µC/cm2, 40 kV/cm, and 200, respectively. These are typical values of the SBT films fabricated by the “face-to-face” annealing technique. The SiO2 equivalent thickness of STA/SiON “I” layer is assumed to be 4.5 nm.We first calculated the drain current-gate voltage (ID–VG) characteristics of the MFIS structures with various SBT thick-nesses as shown in Fig. 4(a), assuming the operation voltage of 5 V. The SBT thickness is varied from 200 to 600 nm. Since the memory window is given by 2VC, to obtain a mem-ory window of more than 1.5 V, the SBT film must be thicker than 187.5 nm, if the coercive field EC of the SBT film is as-sumed to be 40 kV/cm. It is found that the memory window is as small as 0.75 V when the SBT thickness is 200 nm, whereas a large memory window can be obtained if we use a thick SBT film. However, in the MFIS structures, the used P–E hysteresis loop is one of the minor loops as shown in Fig. 4(b). Figure 4(b) shows the P–E hysteresis loops used in the MFIS structures with the SBT thicknesses of 200, 400, and 600 nm when ±5 V is applied. For the MFIS structure with a SBT film thickness of 200 nm, the electric field applied to the SBT film is only 35 kV/cm when 5 V is applied to the MFIS structure, which is smaller than the coercive field of the sat-urated P–E loop. When the SBT film thickness is increased2920Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. Vol. 40 (2001) Pt. 1, No. 4BE. TOKUMITSU et al.Fig. 4. Calculated (a) ID–VG characteristics of the MFIS structures with various SBT thicknesses and (b) P–E hysteresis loops used in the MFIS structures when ±5 V is applied.to 600 nm, the applied electric filed becomes even smaller, al-though the large memory window can be obtained because of the thick SBT film. This is undesirable for improving the data retention characteristics as shown in the previous section. The reason why only minor loops can be used in the MFIS struc-ture is that the remanent polarization of the SBT film is much larger than the charge required to control the channel conduc-tivity as we pointed out previously.15)The maximum induced charge per unit area by SiO2 is 3.5 µC/cm2, if we assume that the maximum electric field (breakdown field) is 10 MV/cm and the charge which corresponds to the 1 × 1012cm−2elec-trons is 0.16 µC/cm2. On the other hand, the remanent po-larization of SBT films is as large as 10 µC/cm2. Hence, if we select the MFIS structures with SBT films, we cannot use the saturated P–E hysteresis loop but we can use only a small part of the polarization of the SBT film. This may degrade the data retention characteristics as we",1457
tokumitsu_FeMFET_JJAP_2001.docx,experiment,"ally showed in the previous section.To overcome this difficulty, MFMIS structures should be selected if the SBT film is used. In the MFMIS structure, the area of an MFM ferroelectric capacitor (SF) can be de-signed smaller than that of an MIS diode (SM). Hence, we can equivalently reduce the polarization of the ferroelectric film. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the simulated ID–VG charac-Fig. 5. Calculated (a) ID–VG characteristics of the MFMIS-FETs and (b) P–E loops used in the MFMIS-FETs when ±5 V is applied.teristics of the MFMIS-FETs and the P–E loops used in the MFMIS-FETs when ±5 V is applied, respectively. The SBT thickness is assumed to be 250 nm. The area ratio, SM/SF, is varied from 1 to 100. Again, the operation voltage is assumed to be 5 V. It is found that the memory window of the MFMIS structure is as small as 1 V for SM/SF = 1, whereas the mem-ory window becomes about 2 V for the MFMIS-FETs when the area ratio, SM/SF is larger than 5. Since the SBT thick-ness is 250 nm and the coercive field is 40 kV/cm, the maxi-mum memory window is 2 V, which agrees with the calcula-tion. It is interesting to note that the used P–E loops in the MFMIS-FETs are almost saturated when the area ratio SM/SF is larger than 5. This is consistent with the fact that the mem-ory window is almost constant (2 V) for the MFMIS-FETs with SM/SF > 5. In the MFMIS-FETs with the area ratio SM/SF of 15, the electric field applied to the SBT layer is as large as 120 kV/cm, which means that completely saturated P–E hysteresis loops can be used in the MFMIS structure if the area ratio SM/SF is 15.According to the above simulations, we fabricated MFMIS-FETs using ferroelectric SBT film and STA/SiON buffer layer, varying the area ratio SM/SF. The thickness of the SBT film is adjusted from 200–250 nm so that the satu-rated P–E hysteresis loop can be used with practical SM/SFJpn. J. Appl. Phys. Vol. 40 (2001) Pt. 1, No. 4BE.

tokumitsu_FeMFET_JJAP_2001.docx,discussion,", design strategies for ferroelectric-gate FETs using SBT films are (i) MFMIS struc-tures should be selected and (ii) the ferroelectric capacitor area should be designed smaller than the MIS area, so that the saturated P–E hysteresis loop can be used. Furthermore, to prevent the high operation voltage and reduce the depolar-ization field during the data retention, (iii) the capacitance of the “I” layer should be large enough and (iv) the thickness of the ferroelectric layer should be carefully designed. In addi-tion, (v) it is important that the leakage currents of both ferro-electric and “I” layers are small to improve the data retention characteristics.To satisfy these conditions, we fabricated p-channel MFMIS-FETs using ferroelectric SBT and STA/SiON insu-lating (“I”) layers. First, field oxide regions were formed in n-(100) Si substrates for device isolation. Then, source and drain regions were formed by BF+ 2ion implantation followed by the activation annealing at 1000◦C for 30 min. Next, after the STA/SiON stacked “I” layer was formed, a Pt floating gate (60 nm) was vacuum-evaporated and pattered by the lift-off process. Then, ferroelectric SBT films were grown by the sol-gel technique on Pt/STA/SiON/Si structures. The thick-ness of the SBT layer used in this work was approximately 250 nm, which is thinner than that (400 nm) in our previous work.8,15)The crystallization of SBT films was carried out by the face-to-face annealing technique at 750◦C.14)Next, Pt gate electrodes were vacuum-evaporated and patterned. Fi-nally, contact holes for source and drain regions were opened by reactive ion etching (RIE) and Al electrodes were formed. The schematic cross section of the fabricated MFMIS-FETs is shown in Fig. 6. Note that in the fabricated MFMIS-FETs, the area of the Pt floating gate is larger than that of the top electrodes. The area ratio SM/SF was varied from 3 to 15. The channel length and width were 5 µm and 50 µm, respec-tively.Figure 7 shows",521

It is interesting to note that the memory window increases with the applied gate voltage and becomes constant when the gate voltage is larger than ±3.5 V. This indicates that the saturated P–E hysteresisFig. 6. Schematic cross section of the fabricated MFMIS-FET.loop of the SBT film is available even when the gate volt-age is as low as ±3.5 V, if the area ratio SM/SF is as large as 12. This is in contrast to our previous work, where about 8 V is necessary to reach the saturation of the memory window. In our previous work, 400 nm SBT films were used in the MFMIS-FETs with an area ratio SM/SF = 6. Therefore, the reduction of the SBT thickness and large SM/SF ratios in this work result in the low voltage operation of the MFMIS-FETs. Figure 8 shows how the ID–VG characteristics of the MFMIS-FETs change with the area ratio SM/SF. The gate voltage sweep is ±3.5 V and the area ratio SM/SF is varied from 3 to 15. It is found that the memory window is only 0.5 V for the device with SM/SF = 3, which indicates that only one of the minor P–E loops is used. On the other hand, when the area ratio SM/SF is larger than 9, the memory win-dow is almost constant and as large as 1.5 V, which shows the saturated P–E hysteresis loop is effectively used in the devices with such area ratios. Hence, by increasing the area ratio SM/SF and reducing the SBT thickness to 250 nm, the MFMIS-FET operating at less than 3.5 V is successfully fab-Fig. 7.

The gate leakage current is less than 3 × 10−8A/cm2 at a gate voltage of ±3.5 V. Next, we examine the data retention characteristics of the fabricated MFMIS-FETs when the small voltage is used to write the data. Figure 9 shows on and off drain currents of MFMIS-FETs with area ratios SM/SF of 6 and 15 as a func-tion of the data retention time. To measure data retention characteristics, we first applied a ±3.5 V programing pulse to write “1” or “0” for 100 ms, then the gate voltage was maintained at −0.35 V during a certain retention time, and the drain current was kept measuring at a drain voltage of−0.1 V. Hence, the depolarization field is constantly applied to the SBT film during the data retention measurements. It is found that the data retention characteristics can be improved by increasing the area ratio. For the MFMIS-FET with an area ratio SM/SF of 6, the drain current on/off ratio is initially 3 × 104and is reduced to less than 103after 6000 s (1.7 h). On the other hand, when the area ratio is increased to 15, the drain current on/off ratio is still about 3 orders of magnitude after 10 h have passed, even if the programming pulse is as low as ±3.5 V. The electric fields applied to the SBT films when the ±3.5 V programming pulse is applied are estimated to be +95 ∼ −70 and +60 ∼ −50 kV/cm for the MFMIS structures with area ratios SM/SF of 15 and 6, respectively. Hence, by using a large area ratio, a relatively large electric field can be applied to the SBT film in spite of the small oper-ation voltage of ±3.5 V, which may result in fairly good data retention characteristics as shown in Fig. 9.5.",1116

It is shown by the numerical simulation that it is impossible to use the saturated hysteresisloop of the SBT film in MFIS structures. To utilize the satu-rated P–E loop, MFMIS structures with a large SM/SF ratio have to be selected. Then, the MFMIS-FETs using an SBT film and STA/SiON stacked “I” layer have been designed and fabricated. We have demonstrated that fabricated p-channel MFMIS-FETs can operate at a voltage less than 3.5 V. The memory window of 1.5 V was obtained for the device with an area ratio SM/SF = 15, even if the gate voltage sweep is as small as ±3.5 V. It was also found that the fabricated MFMIS-FETs have fairly good data retention characteristics. In",222

Funakubo_Epitaxial_YHfO2_JAP_2016.docx,INTRODUCTION,"The discovery of ferroelectric behavior in HfO2-based thin films1has triggered intensive research efforts to realize ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs) and improve commercial ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM).. Compared with conventional ferroelectrics such as lead zir-conate titanate and strontium bismuth tantalate, which have relatively poor interface properties with silicon, and face severe scaling limitations, HfO2-based ferroelectric thin films have excellent compatibility with complementary met-al–oxide–semiconductor technology.. In addition, these films show stable ferroelectricity down to a thickness of just 5 nm,2 demonstrating potential for scale down.. Demonstrations of FeFETs and FeRAM with ferroelectric HfO2-based thin films have already been reported,2as well as investigations of forming gas annealing3and fatigue en-durance,4which are crucial for these applications.. In contrast to these extensive application-oriented stud-ies, the fundamental properties of ferroelectric HfO2 thin films including their crystal structure, spontaneous polariza-tion, and domain structure have not been still elucidated sufficiently.. This is because of the polycrystalline character-istics of the deposited films as well as the presence of multi-ple phases in previously reported films.1–8This situation has continued since ferroelectricity in a HfO2-based thin film was first reported for a Si-doped HfO2 polycrystalline film in 2011.1 a)E-mail: funakubo.h.aa@m.titech.ac.jp To improve the fundamental understanding of HfO2-based ferroelectric films, the investigation of epitaxial films is essential..",391
Funakubo_Epitaxial_YHfO2_JAP_2016.docx,EXPERIMENT,"ALA. Selection of substrates for orientation-controlled film growthConsidering the crystallographic relationship between the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases described in Section II, orientation control of the tetragonal phase is expected to also lead to that of the orthorhombic phase. When we grow the tetragonal phase with the shorter aT-axis perpendicular to the substrate surface (t1 and t2) during deposition, subsequent phase transformation upon cooling will produce the ortho-rhombic phase with the shorter bO- and/or cO-axis perpendic-ular to the substrate surface (o1, o2, o3, and o4). In the same way, when we grow the tetragonal phase with the longer cT-axis perpendicular to the substrate surface (t3) during deposition, subsequent phase transformation produces the orthorhombic phase with the longest aO-axis perpendicular to the substrate surface (o5 and o6). Therefore, the selective growth of tetragonal phase consisting of t1 and/or t2 variants, and t3 variant is the first step to achieve orientation control of the orthorhombic phase.For the selective growth of t1 and/or t2 and t3, the sub-strate surface must be selected so that its lattice matches with the in-plane lattice parameter of the tetragonal phase. To grow the t3 variant, out-of-plane cT-axis oriented tetrago-nal films, a substrate surface with a lattice that matches aT at the growth temperature is required. Conversely, for the growth of t1 and/or t2 variants, the two lattice parameters aT and cT of the tetragonal phase must match with those of the substrate. However, finding a substrate with a rectangular surface that matches these two lattice parameters is generally difficult. For this reason, we used a different approach based on the case of (100)-oriented tetragonal PbTiO3 epitaxial films grown on cubic (001) KTaO3 substrates. In this case, the a- and c-axes of the tetragonal PbTiO3 are aligned along directions and diagonal lattice matching is in-plane obtained.17Based on this result, we consider that the lattice matching between the diagonal of the square surface of the cubic substrate and that of the rectangular surface of the aT-axis oriented tetragonal phase also induces the selective growth of the out-of-plane aT-axis oriented tetragonal phase.On the basis of the above consideration, we used cubic (001) YSZ and (001)-oriented epitaxial indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated cubic (001) YSZ, (001) ITO//(001) YSZ, as substrates for the growth of o1, o2, o3, and/or o4, and o5, and/ or o6.

Prior to the deposition of the YHO-7 films, an epitaxial ITO buffer layer with a thickness of 150 nm was also prepared on the (001) YSZ substrate by PLD to prepare the (001) ITO// (001) YSZ substrates.Structural characterization of the deposited films was carried out at room temperature. The thickness of the YHO-7 films and ITO buffer layer was examined by X-ray reflectiv-ity (X’pert MRD, Panalytical) and touch-probe scanning measurement (AlphaStep, Tencor), respectively. XRD h–2h and in-plane scans were performed using a high-resolution diffractometer (SmartLab, Rigaku).

A series diffraction peaks from YHO-7 including {100}, {200}, {300}, and {400} were observed for the film on a (001) YSZ substrate (Fig. 3(a)), corresponding to {100} orientation ofFIG. 2.

To determine the diagonal matchingof the aT-axis oriented tetragonal phase, the value of q of the side of the square whose diagonal length is ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi is also shown (Fig. 2(b)). This value is the lengthp tangular surface of the aT-axis oriented tetragonal phase. The ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi , which corresponds to the diagonal of the rec-lattice parameters of the tetragonal phase at the depositiontemperature were estimated from the values reported for YHO-7 ceramic at room temperature and the thermal expan-sion coefficient of tetragonal ZrO2.13,18Note that half of the original lattice parameter is used here for ITO, because itsbixbyite structure, described as an oxygen-deficient fluorite (both HfO2 and ZrO2 are fluorites), has a unit cell parameter twice that of fluorite. The lattice mismatch between (001)YSZ and the out-of-plane aT-axis oriented tetragonal phase ( for (001) YSZ and the aT-axis oriented tetragonal phase, q ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ) is estimated to be þ0.02% (5.184 and 5.185 A˚respectively), while that between (001) ITO and the cT-axis oriented tetragonal phase is estimated to be �0.39% (5.135 and 5.115 A˚ for (001) ITO and the cT-axis oriented tetrago-nal phase, respectively). These mismatches are small enoughto expect epitaxial growth of the YHO-7 films.B. Film growth and characterizationYHO-7 films with a thickness of 9 nm were prepared by PLD using a KrF excimer laser (k ¼ 248 nm) at a substratethe YHO-7 film. In this sample, diffraction angles of the {200}pc and {400}pc peaks of YHO-7 were higher than those of the 002 and 004 peaks of the YSZ substrate, respectively, indicating the possibility that these peaks originate from the shorter bO- and/or cO-axis out-of-plane orientations of the orthorhombic phase. In contrast, only {200} and {400} dif-fraction peaks of YHO-7 were observed for the film grown on a (001) ITO//(001) YSZ substrate; {100}pc and {300}pc diffraction peaks were not observed (Fig. 3(d)). The reason for this is discussed below. In this sample, the diffraction angles of the {200} and {400} peaks of YHO-7 were lower than those of the 002 and 004 peaks of the YSZ substrate, respectively, suggesting that these peaks may result from the longer aO-axis out-of-plane orientation of the orthorhombic phase.Figures 3(b) and 3(e) show the rocking curves of YHO-7 {400} diffraction peaks for the YHO-7 films deposited on (001) YSZ and (001) ITO//(001) YSZ substrates; their full width at half-maximum (FWHM) values were 0.12�and 0.52�, respectively. This difference probably originates from the difference of the orientation perfection of the substrates, because the rocking-curve FWHM value of YSZ 004 was 0.015�for a (001) YSZ substrate, whereas that of ITO 008 was 0.30�for a (001) ITO//(001) YSZ substrate (data not shown in the figure). Nevertheless, because of the structural similarity between YHO-7, YSZ, and ITO, both YHO-7 films were highly {100}-oriented.Figures 3(c) and 3(f) show the",1156

Characterization of the orientation of orthorhombic C. Crystal structure characterization of YHO-7 filmsfilms deposited on (001) YSZ substratesNext, the symmetry and orientation of the deposited films were examined. To identify the specific orientation of the {100}-oriented YHO-7 films, various out-of-plane and in-plane XRD measurements were performed. In general, diffraction with mixed even/odd indices is forbidden for ideal fluorite structures such as cubic ZrO2 and HfO2. However, for ferroelectric orthorhombic HfO2, diffraction with mixed even/odd indices such as 010 and 110 could be permitted because of the displacements of the constituent atoms from the regular positions of the cubic fluorite struc-ture. Fortunately, these characteristic diffractions of the orthorhombic phase occur only for certain indices, so they are useful for identifying a specific orientation. We used the 010 and 110 diffraction, which are the only ones allowedAs mentioned above, for the YHO-7 films on the (001)YSZ substrates, the out-of-plane XRD h–2h scan (Fig. 3(a)) indicates shorter bO- and/or cO-axis out-of-plane orientation of the orthorhombic phase. Note that the h–2h scan con-tained the {100} diffraction peak, where the h–2h scan corre-sponds to the scan along Qz in Fig. 4. Only o1 and o3 have the {100} diffraction spot along Qz in Fig. 4, namely, the 010 diffraction spot along Qz (Figs. 4(b) and 4(d)), whereas other orientations lack the {100} diffraction spots along Qz. Therefore, the {100} diffraction peak observed in the h–2h scan (Fig. 3(a)) can be assigned as the 010 diffraction peak,signifying the presence of the bO-axis out-of-plane-oriented orthorhombic phase (o1 and/or o3). In the same way, the {300} diffraction peak in Fig. 3(a) can be assigned as theamong the 100, 010, 001, 110, 101, and 011 diffraction. 030 diffraction peak.Figure 4 summarizes the positions of the 010 and 110 diffraction spots in reciprocal space for each orthorhombic orientation shown in Fig. 1.

The XRD pole figure measurement of theYHO-7 110 diffraction (Fig. 5(b)) shows four distinct dif-fraction spots that are 90�apart from each other along the in-plane rotation axis. This result indicates the presence of the epitaxially grown bO-axis orientation in two different in-plane orientations with the aO-axis perpendicular to each other; that is, the presence of both o1 and o3.The existence of the bO-axis out-of-plane orientation (o1 and o3) indicates the possibility of the presence of the cO-axis orientation (o2 and o4), because o1 and o2 are generated from the same tetragonal variant t1, and o3 and o4 are gener-ated from the same tetragonal variant t2, as shown in Fig. 1.However, the out-of-plane cO-axis orientations cannot beidentified from the out-of-plane XRD scan depicted in Fig. 3(a), because the {400} diffraction peak was not split into two recognizable 040 and 004 peaks.

This indicates the possibility of the existence of the ferroelastic domains o1/o2 and o3/o4 (see Fig. 1). This result is in good agreement with our expectation that the YHO-7 films on (001) YSZ substrates consist of t1 and t2 during high-temperature growth and transform into o1, o2, o3, and o4 upon cooling.D. Crystal structure characterization of YHO-7 films deposited on (001) ITO//(001) YSZ substratesHere we discuss the structure of the YHO-7 films grown on the (001) ITO//(001) YSZ substrates. The out-of-plane XRD h–2h scan (Fig. 3(d)) contains the YHO-7 {200} and {400} diffraction peaks at lower angles than those of the YSZ 002 and 004 diffraction peaks, respectively. This indi-cates the possibility of the existence of the longest out-of-plane aO-axis orientation (o5 and/or o6). In addition, this scan did not contain YHO-7 {100} and {300} diffraction peaks, in other words, 010 and 030 diffraction peaks, sug-gesting the absence of the out-of-plane bO-axis orientation (o1 and o3).Out-of-plane aO-axis orientations o5 and o6 have a char-acteristic 110 diffraction spot along out-of-plane directions (see Figs. 4(f) and 4(g)) the same as that of the out-of-plane bO-axis orientations o1 and o3 (Figs. 4(b) and 4(d)). Because the out-of-plane bO-axis orientations are excluded as dis-cussed above, the observation of the 110 diffraction spot is crucial to identify the out-of-plane aO-axis orientation. The XRD-RSM around the out-of-plane YSZ 202 diffraction spot in Fig. 6(a) contains the 110 diffraction spot of the YHO-7 film. Moreover, the coordinates of the 110 diffraction spot coincide with the rectangular lattice that has smaller in-plane and larger out-of-plane lattice parameters, proving that thefilm contains the out-of-plane aO-axis orientation and not the out-of-plane bO-axis orientation.

Furthermore, Kim et al. confirmed ferroelectricity for pure hafnium oxide for smaller grain sizes induced by a lower deposition temperature.36 Therefore, the grain size seems to play a crucial role in the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase in HZO. In the publi-cation by Materlik et al.9a surface energy model is used to explain how a window for a stable ferroelectric orthorhom-bic phase can occur between the tetragonal phase as the sta-ble phase for the lowest grain size and the monoclinic bulk phase.

Lett. 110, 182905 (2017)to the piezoelectric response found for yttrium doped HfO2 in a previous work.23With further cycling accompanied by a wake-up, the piezoelectric response is reduced. This is probably cor-related with the cycling induced phase transition which takes place during wake up as mentioned before. An increase in the piezoelectric coefficient around phase transition regions where different phases compete was also shown for perovskite based ferroelectrics.45,46Therefore, by controlling the initial phase and the phase transition during wake-up, the piezoelectric response can be further increased. The inset in Figure 2 shows a DBLI measurement with a unipolar signal, whereby a piezo-electric coefficient of 10pm/V can be extracted.Figure 3 shows the piezoelectric activity that can be probed on a nanoscale via PFM. The solid metal tips were initially chosen to ensure that the high displacement currents can be provided to achieve the desired sinusoidal excitation field required for the lock-in technique. However, the pads started peeling off when the bias sweep was performed, which might be due to the high absolute amplitude of the piezoresponse compared to a film with a thickness of just around 10 nm. To get an idea of the local manifestation of the piezoelectric properties, the measurements had to be per-formed on the bare oxide. As it was argued, for example, by Balke et al.,47,48artifacts can give rise to hysteretic loops, and it is hard to argue with PFM alone that the measure loops are dominated by the piezoelectric response itself. Capacitor measurements are preferable to achieve this goal. However, the remanent loop shown here is nicely saturated and fairly symmetric and exhibits a phase jump of exactly 180�. This is in line with the theory of a ferroelectric response but cannot be taken for granted on bare oxide as pointed out before.47,48 Figure 4 shows the",609

Zhou 2010 Enhancement of dielectric and ferroelectric	properties in ferroelectric superlattices.docx,Experiment,"ally, elevated remanent polarization is one of the most important features of fer-roelectric superlattices. Lee et al. reported a strong polarization enhancement in asymmetric three-component ferroelectric super-lattices [4]. Shimuta et al. reported the largest remanent polar-ization 2Pr of 46 µC/cm2, which is about three times that of the BaTiO3 single-phase film, in asymmetric epitaxial BaTiO3/SrTiO3 (BTO/STO) strained superlattice structures [2]. On the other hand, the enhancement in the dielectric constant is also a commonly observed phenomenon in ferroelectric multilayer/superlattices. Wang et al. reported the enhancement of the dielectric constant in multilayered Pb(Zr0.8Ti0.2)O3/Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 thin films prepared by rf magnetron sputtering [5].

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.ssc.2010.04.032their anomalous behavior is rather limited. It is believed that the interfacial coupling between the constituent layers should play an important role and hence must be taken into consideration [6,7]. The strong interfacial coupling between individual polar layers are proposed as mechanisms leading to the observed behavior that cannot be explained simply in terms of those measured on single films of the constituent materials in epitaxial SrTiO3/BaTiO3 superlattices [8]. The enhancement of dielectric properties of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 films with tetragonal/rhombohedral multilayered structure is attributed to the presence of interfaces between the tetragonal and the rhombohedral phase layers [3,5]. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that electrical conductivity in ferroelectrics can induce new phenomena or modify known physical phenomena, which may be difficult to understand if the materials are regarded as perfectly insulating [9,10]. In particular, the time-dependent space-charge-limited (TDSCL) conduction has been demonstrated to be a possible origin leading to the abnormal polarization offset along the polarization axis widely observed in the compositionally graded ferroelectric thin films [9]. It is also suggested that the dramatically elevated dielectric constants may be obtainable by increasing the conductivity of the ferroelectric superlattices through impurity doping [1]. However, so far only very few theoretical investigations have been performed to study the interplay of the effects of interfacial coupling and electrical conductivity on the ferroelectric and dielectric properties of multilayer/superlattices. I believe such investigations can furnish further insight into the mechanism.Taking the hint that electrical conductivity may play a non-trivial role behind the many anomalous phenomena observed in ferroelectric thin films and composite structures [1,9,10], I aim in the present work to study to what extent the consideration of elec-trical conductivity can account for the enhancement of ferroelec-tric and dielectric properties in the interface-coupled ferroelectricY.

Theory and modeling2.1. Landau–Khalatnikov kinetics of switchingConsider an infinite ferroelectric superlattice formed from alternating layers of two different materials A and B. A typical repeating unit (a period) of this structure is a bilayer of A and B. Periodic boundary conditions are applied to the top and bottom surfaces of this bilayer unit so as to describe the infinite ferroelectric superlattice. This suggests that I only have to consider a one-period superlattice structure. Further, each layer A or B in the superlattice interacts with its neighboring layers via some interfacial coupling mechanism to be elaborated later on.I assume that all spatial variation takes place along the x-direction. The dynamics of the dipoles of A and B are modeled by the Landau–Khalatnikov equation:γA∂t = −αAPA(x, t) − βAPA(x, t)3− νAPA(x, t)5 d2PA(x, t)∂PA(x, t)γB∂PB(x, t) + EA(x, t) + κA∂t = −αBPB(x, t) − βBPB(x, t)3− νBPB(x, t)5 dx2 (1)where γ+ EB(x, t) + κBrepresents the viscosity that causes the delay in d2PB(x, t)dx2motion of dipole moments. α, β and ν are the corresponding Landau coefficients of the material. The last term in each of the above equations comes from energy associated with polarization gradients, where κ is the corresponding interaction coefficient between neighboring dipoles.The form of the kinetic equations above conforms to the equations used by a number of works, notedly [11,12], which is obtained by minimizing the free energy of the film under applied electric field. It should be noted that E(x, t) in Eq. (1) denotes the local electric field instead of external electric field. With this approach, the explicit consideration of the depolarization field is subsumed in the formulation. In particular, Baudry and Tournier [11] has given an excellent",647

Electric conductionIn our previous study of compositionally graded ferroelectric films [9,15], I derived the following formula for the time-dependent conductivity associated with space charges and named it ‘time-dependent space-charge-limited conduction’ (TDSCL):∂D(x, t) σ(x, t) =µp − µn∂x+��µp + µn∂D(x, t)∂x�2 + σ0(x)2 (4)where D(x, t) = ε(x)E(x, t) + P(x, t) is the electric displacement at position x and time t, σ0(x) is the intrinsic conductivity, µp and−µn (µp, µn > 0) are the positive and negative charge carrier mobilities, respectively. Here I also employ the same conduction mechanism as described in Ref. [9]. The total current J(t) across the superlattice structure is constitutive of the conduction and displacement currents:J(t) = jc(x, t) + jd(x, t) = σ(x, t)E(x, t) +∂∂t D(x, t) (5)where subscripts c and d denote the conduction and displacement currents, respectively. The circuit condition is given by:� dB E(x, t)dx = E(t)L (6)where L = dA + dB is periodic thickness and E(t) = Eamp sin(ωt) is the applied electric field across the superlattice. It is noted that the applied electric field amplitude Eamp should be sufficiently small so that polarization switching will not occur within the ferroelectric superlattice when measuring permittivity. The measured electric displacement of the superlattice at a certain time t is given by the integration of total current density across the circuit:D(t) =� t J(t)dt.

The thickness ratio of BTO and STO was usually chosen to be one in most of the BTO/STO superlattices. Recently, Shimuta and cowork-ers reported the enhancement of remanent polarization in asym-metric BaTiO3/SrTiO3 strained superlattices with unequal BTO and STO layer thickness within each stacking periodicity [2]. In their work, both symmetric and asymmetric BTO/STO superlattices have been fabricated by a pulsed-laser deposition technique. The super-lattice with 15 unit cells of BTO and 3 unit cells of STO in one pe-riod showed the largest remanent polarization 2Pr of 26 µC/cm2, which is more than three times that of single-phase BTO thin film, and approaching that of bulk BTO.

In a re-cent paper [3], Pontes et al. reported the enhancement of both dielectric and ferroelectric properties of heterolayered PZT film, which consisted of six alternating Pb(Zr0.6Ti0.4)O3 (PZT60) and Pb(Zr0.4Ti0.6)O3 (PZT40) layers, fabricated by a chemical solution deposition. In their work, a dielectric constant of 701 at 100 kHz was observed for the heterolayered PZT40/PZT60 film. The dielec-tric constant of the heterolayered PZT film cannot be explained by the capacitor series model, according to which the PZT multilayer structure is regarded as a series connection of PZT60 and PZT40 layers, thus the effective dielectric constant can be expressed the-oretically as:εeff =�εPZT60 + εPZT40 + εPZT60 + εPZT40 1 t1 t2 t3 t4+ εPZT60 + εPZT40� �(t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 + t5 + t6) (9) t5 t6where t1, t3, and t5 are the thickness of PZT60 and t2, t4, and t6 are the thickness of PZT40. By assuming that the dielectric constants of PZT60 and PZT40 are 452 and 512, εeff was calculated to be about 481. However, the measured dielectric constant value (∼701) was much higher. On the other hand, it has been theoretically demonstrated that the permittivity of ferroelectric composites can be significantly enhanced by electrical conductivity [10]. It is also suggested that the measured permittivity will dramatically increase by increasing the conductivity of the ferroelectric superlattices [1]. Interestingly, our calculation gives a value of 698 for the permittivity of heterolayered PZT film at the frequency of 100 kHz. The frequency dependence of dielectric constant is shown in Fig. 3 by taking TDSCL conductivity into account (denoted by the solid lines) or treating the superlattice as perfect insulator (denoted by the dashed lines).

However, there are almost no notable permittivity enhancement when the frequency is decreased without considering conductivity. It is our belief that the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity is due to the involvement of electrical conductivity.Fig. 4 shows the hysteresis loop of PZT60, PZT40, and PZT multilayered thin film. Interesting to note, the P–E hysteresis loop of the PZT multilayered film is much inflated comparing with that of single-phase PZT films, the same feature also observed in BTO/STO superlattices as discussed in Section 1.

CSHwang_Zr_Content_Wake_up_effect_ACSNano_2016.docx,ABSTRACT,": In this study, the changes in the structural and electrical properties of ferroelectric Hf1−xZrxO2 films with various Zr contents (0.26−0.70) were systematically examined during electric field cycling, resulting in a “wake-up” effect. To quantify the degree of wake-up effect, a“variable” polarization as the difference between remanent and saturationpolarization was suggested as a new parameter, which could be calculatedby excluding the linear dielectric contribution from the total electricdisplacement. Here, the variable polarization value could be minimized foran optimized Zr content of 0.43, which was slightly lower than the value for the largest remanent polarization. The polymorphism in Hf1−xZrxO2 thin films is known to be complicated due to the relatively small energy differences between various phases, such as the monoclinic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic phases. The variations in the polarization-electric field characteristics and dielectric constant values could be qualitatively and quantitativelyunderstood based on the competition of various polymorphs that are dependent on the Zr content. Furthermore, a schematic model for the spatial distribution of mixed phases was suggested for Hf1−xZrxO2 films with various Zr contents based on the",291
CSHwang_Zr_Content_Wake_up_effect_ACSNano_2016.docx,DISCUSSION,"Before the wake-up effect in the Hf1−xZrxO2 films are examined, new parameters that could quantify the degree of wake-up effect were defined. Up to now, the changes in the Pr and Ec values have been considered parameters that can quantify the degree of wake-up effect.9−11,24−28This work, however, adopted more refined parameters, as shown below, to more quantitatively and accurately reveal the variation in the Pr value with the wake-up cycles. From the careful review of the previous reports on the wake-up effect of doped HfO2 or Hf1−xZrxO2 films by the authors and other groups,9−11,24,30an interesting common observation was found. During the wake-up process, the changes in the maximum polarization (more precisely, maximum electric displacement) value of Hf1−xZrxO2 or doped HfO2 films were lower than ∼5% while those in the Pr value were higher than ∼30%. This appears reasonable because the maximum polarization under the maximum electric field condition includes the contributions from the Pr, which must be largely influenced by the wake-up process, and the dielectric displacement from the field-induced polarization of the lattice (the background dielectric constant (εr) is responsible for this component), which has little relevance to the wake-up process. From the pulse switching measurement of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films in the authors’ previous study, it was suggested that interfacial t-phase materials are present near the top and bottom TiN electrodes, and that the thicknesses of these interfacial layers decreased during the wake-up field cycling.9−11This nonferro-electric interfacial layer should form a large depolarization field, and a part of the film could be depolarized when the electric field is removed. If the interfacial t-phase is diminished by the field cycling, the depolarization effect disappears, and the wake-up effect can be induced. On the other hand, the t-phase can be transformed to a ferroelectric o-phase under sufficiently high electric field, and changed back to a t-phase after removal of electric field. Thus, this field-induced phase transition may also vary during wake-up cycling.15467DOI: 10.1021/acsami.6b03586 ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2016, 8, 15466−15475ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch ArticleTo accurately and quantitatively estimate such effects relatedto the interfacial layers, the contribution of the εr of the Hf1−xZrxO2 ferroelectric films to the estimated P−E curves must be removed. Although the εr value of a ferroelectric Hf1−xZrxO2 film (∼30) is smaller than those of perovskite ferroelectrics such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 by an order of magnitude, the electric field for P−E measurement is much higher than those of perovskite ferroelectrics.5As a result, the dielectric contribution to electric displacement becomes significant while the Pr value of Hf1−xZrxO2 films is relatively smaller than that of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, making the relative contribution of the dielectric portion to the P−E curve rather significant. Therefore, the real P−E curves, free from the influence of the linear dielectriccontribution, were estimated from the",769

By contrast, the depolarization and reverse phasetransition from o- to t-phase can be estimated using eq 2, whichis called variable polarization (Pv) in this work and plays a role as a useful measure of the wake-up effect, when the wake-up effect is assumed to originate from the removal of the depolarization effect according to the t- to o-phase transitionof the interfacial layers.2 P=2 D−2 0 r ε εEE max−2 P r=2 P s−2 P r(1)2 P v=2 D max(2)−2 ε ε 0 rwhere ε0, Dmax, Ps, and Emax are the permittivity of vacuum, maximum D, saturation polarization, and maximum electric field, respectively. The Pv could result from the polarization change both from the transition between ferroelectric andnonferroelectric phase and depolarization of ferroelectric phase. In fact, E must take into account the different εr values of the ferroelectric bulk layer and nonferroelectric interfacial layers, but as they are not much different, E was simply calculated by dividing the applied voltage by the total film thickness.3When the depolarization effect disappears during the wake-up process, the 2Pv value may become almost zero after the wake-up field cycling. The relative ratio of 2Pv compared to 2Ps can be used to quantify the degree of wake-up effect, and as such, by usingthis normalized 2Pv value with respect to the 2Ps value (2Pv,nor = 2Pv/2Ps), the degrees of wake-up effect of ferroelectric Hf1−xZrxO2 films with different 2Ps values could be fairly compared.Figure 1a−e shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography images of the Hf1−xZrxO2 films with Zr contents of 1.00, 0.70, 0.51, 0.26, and 0.00, respectively, deposited on a TiNbottom electrode, whereas Figure 1f shows the topographyimage of the TiN bottom electrode before the deposition of Hf1−xZrxO2 films. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the TiN bottom electrode and the Hf1−xZrxO2 films were 0.79 and 0.97−1.65 nm, respectively, confirming the uniform and conformal growth of the Hf1−xZrxO2 films. The relatively high RMS roughness of ZrO2 might have resulted from the partial crystallization of the ZrO2 film due to its relatively low crystallization temperature compared to that of the Hf-richer films. Figure 2a shows the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns of the ∼9.2 nm thick Hf1−xZrxO2 films with various Zr contents (x = 0.26−0.70).

The variations in thewake-up behaviors could be grouped into three according tothe x values: for x = 0.51 and 0.43, the films were ferroelectric-like; for x = 0.35 and 0.26, they were still ferroelectric-like, buttheir Pr values were significantly decreased; and for x = 0.70 and 0.60, the films showed severely distorted P−E curves. As for theHf0.49Zr0.51O2 film (see Figure 4c), the slope of the P−E curve near Ec significantly increased with the increasing number of wake-up cycles while the change in the slope of the P−E curveof the Hf0.57Zr0.43O2 film was negligible (Figure 4d). Moreover, the relative changes in the 2Pr value during the wake-up field cycling were much larger in the Hf0.49Zr0.51O2 film than in the Hf0.57Zr0.43O2 film. These differences mean that there exist significant differences between the wake-up processes of theHf0.49Zr0.51O2 and Hf0.57Zr0.43O2 films despite the relatively small composition difference. When the Zr contents werefurther decreased to 0.35 and 0.26, however, the changes in thePr and Ps values were very different from those in the Hf0.49Zr0.51O2 and Hf0.57Zr0.43O2 films. For the Hf0.65Zr0.35O2 and Hf0.74Zr0.26O2 films, both the Pr and Ps values significantly increased during the wake-up field cycling, although themagnitude of Pr even in the woken-up state was still much lower than that in the Hf0.49Zr0.51O2 film (Figure 4e,f). The Hf0.40Zr0.60O2 film showed an almost ferroelectric-like P−Ecurve after only 105cycles while it showed a distorted P−Ecurve in the pristine state. In contrast, the Hf0.30Zr0.70O2 film still showed a distorted P−E curve even after 108field cycleswhile the degree of distortion slightly decreased with theincreasing number of wake-up cycles.Figure 5a,b shows the changes in the 2Pr and 2Ps values of the Hf1−xZrxO2 films as a function of the x-value for the pristineand variously cycled cases. In the pristine state, the 2Pr value of the Hf0.49Zr0.51O2 film was the largest (∼32.1 μC/cm2), whichfurther increased to 40.0, 41.7, 41.8, and 42.1 μC/cm2after 105,105.3, 105.7, and 106field cycles, respectively. The 2Ps value of the Hf0.49Zr0.51O2 film in the pristine state was 40.1 μC/cm2,which is larger than the 2Pr value by 8.0 μC/cm2, meaning that∼20% of the Ps at the high electric field was depolarized after the removal of the electric field (2Pv ∼ 8.0 μC/cm2). With theincreasing number of wake-up cycles, however, the 2Pv value significantly decreased, and it became almost zero after 106timefield cycling.

The normalized 2Pv decreased from ∼66 to ∼25% after 106time electric field cycling. The difference between the changes in the 2Pv values of the Hf0.30Zr0.70O2 and Hf0.40Zr0.60O2 films could be understood based on the phase transition during wake-up fieldcycling. From the 2Pr values in the pristine state, it could be estimated that a substantial portion of the films existed in t-phase both for the Hf0.30Zr0.70O2 and Hf0.40Zr0.60O2 films under zero external field. This estimation stems from the double-loop-shaped P−E hysteresis curve. At a low E, the t-phase has thelowest energy among the three phases, which shows an almostnonferroelectric property where the c/a ratio of the crystal lattice (1.015−1.029) is smaller than the 2a/(b + c) of the o-phase (1.036−1.042). It should be noted that the longest axesof the t- and o-phases are the c- and a-axes, respectively. Under a high enough E, the electrostatic energy (P·E) overcomes the energy difference between the t- and o-phases, and the filmtransforms to o-phase, which induces large Ps values. When the E is removed, the stable t-phase is recovered, and small Pr values are generally achieved. From the difference in the magnitude of the electric field required for field-induced phase transition, it could be noticed that the energy difference between the o- and t-phases in the Hf0.30Zr0.70O2 film was larger than that in the Hf0.40Zr0.60O2 film, which is also consistent with the",1441

After 105, 105.3, 105.7, and 106time wake-up field cycling, the 2Pv (2Pv,nor) value decreased to 2.9 μC/cm2(6.7%), 1.2 μC/cm2(2.8%), 0.6 μC/ cm2(1.4%), and 0.2 μC/cm2(0.5%), respectively. From the quite large 2Pv value in the pristine state, the Hf0.49Zr0.51O2 film contained a certain portion of t-phase, but its relative portion should be much smaller than that in the Hf0.40Zr0.60O2 film.

These differences might have originated from the overestimated surface energy effect due to the underestimated grain size of the Hf1−xZrxO2 films. Park et al. and Kim et al. reported that the average grain sizes of a ∼10 nm thick Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film were 14.4 and 14.2 nm, respectively.4,31These values are relatively larger than 9 nm, which was used by Materlik et al.32When the larger grain size is considered, the relative free energy of the m-phase can decrease by ∼9 meV/f.u. for the Hf0.74Zr0.26O2 film when the hexagonal columnar grain is considered.32Moreover, there should be a certain grain size distribution, which strongly affects the free energy of each phase. It should be noted that the energy differences between the m- and o-phases for the Hf0.74Zr0.26O2 and Hf0.65Zr0.35O2 films were smaller than 12 meV/f.u., and that those between the t- and o-phases in all the samples were smaller than 7 meV/f.u.The oxygen vacancies can also affect the polymorphism in Hf1−xZrxO2 films.34Hoffmann et al. reported that based on their computational calculations, the presence of oxygen vacancies further stabilizes the t-phase compared to the o-phase.34They also suggested that oxygen vacancies might be formed in the HfO2-based dielectric layers due to a reduction by reactive metal electrodes such as TiN and TaN.34It was also reported that the surface energy of the t-phase is lower than that of the o-phase, meaning that the interfacial region should favor the t-phase.32Therefore, the interfacial region in Hf1−xZrxO2 films tends to form a t-phase even when the bulk region of the film forms an o-phase. The oxygen vacancy formation energy of HfO2 is higher than that of ZrO2 due to the stronger bond between Hf and O compared with that between Zr and O. Therefore, as the Zr concentration decreases (as the Hf concentration increases), the tendency to have oxygen vacancies within the interfacial region diminishes, which in turn",511

This can explain the decreased depolarization effect when x = 0.43 compared with the case where x = 0.51. Nevertheless, the further decreased Zr concentration induced higher m-phase formation within the bulk region, decreasing the Pr and Ps values. The variations in the properties for the films with x = 0.35 and 0.26 can be understood from the same line of reasoning. As the Zr content further decreased, the depolarization effect could have also been further diminished due to the even thinner interfacial t-phase formation. The 2Pv values in Figure 6a, however, were in fact slightly higher than those in the case with x = 0.43. This may indicate that the interfacial region actually became slightly thicker, which may be ascribed to the increased m-phase formation at such composition. The m-phase content of the bulk portion must have been much higher, and the overall Pr and Ps values must have been the smallest among the six samples. The higher 2Pv,nor value of the sample shown in Figure 6b compared to that of x = 0.43 was due to the largely decreased 2Ps value. Martin et al. reported the m- to o-phase transition during the wake-up process based on a TEM study.27This can consistently explain the wake-up effect in the aforementioned sample in this study.

La-doping was found to be very effective in inhibiting the monoclinic phase formation and in decreasing the leakage current. Notably, the high coercive field, which was one of the most significant problems in this material system, could be decreased by ∼35% at the most promising La-concentration of 0.7 mol. %. As a result, a highly promising field cycling endurance up to 1011cycles could be secured while maintaining a high remnant polar-ization value (≥25 μC/cm2). This is one of the best",251
CSHwang_La_HfO2_high_endurance_APL_2019.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Doped-HfO2-based ferroelectric (FE) thin films have already proved themselves as promising materials for ferro-electric memory technologies including ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM),1ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs),2and ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs).3,4These materials provide the superior properties over traditional fer-roelectrics with the perovskite structure such as scalability, including the possibility to grow these materials by atomic layer deposition (ALD), full complementary metal-oxide- semiconductor (CMOS)-compatibility even with the simpler crystal structure compared with the conventional perovskites.. Under the term “HfO2-based ferroelectrics,” two groups of materials are usually consolidated.. The first one is hafnium oxide doped by various elements (Si, Al, Y, La, Gd, etc.. )5–11with relatively low concentrations, and the second one is a HfO2-ZrO2 solid solution (HZO).12–15Being the root cause of the FE performance in both groups, the orthorhombic phase (space group Pca21, o-phase) seems to always coexist with other polymorphs of HfO2, such as monoclinic (space group P21/c, m-phase), tetragonal (space group P42/nmc, t-phase), or even cubic (space group Fm3m, c-phase).. This is not an optimal aspect of this ferroelectric material system.. It is worth noticing that the absence of the most stable (for the bulk material) m-phase is perceived as an indication of the preferred forma- tion of metastable phases including the FE o-phase.. Among them, HZO solid solution attracts a great deal of attention due to its lower crystallization temperature (≈400 °C) J. Appl.. Phys..",464

Both top and bottom TiN electrodes (20 nm-thick) were grown by a conventional thermal ALD method at a sub-strate temperature of 400 °C using TiCl4 and NH3 as the Ti-precursor and nitrogen source, respectively. This thermal ALD process was utilized instead of the plasma-assisted ALD (PAALD),27which was performed at 320 °C in the previous work,23in order to verify the possibility of the “in situ” crystalli-zation of the underlying HZLO layer during top electrode dep-osition. The total top TiN deposition time was ≈4 h, after which samples were immediately unloaded to the load-lock system. This could be an effective approach for the implementation of such FE capacitors to a BEOL process, avoiding the PDA.

The estimated La content, aswell as the Hf/Zr ratio, was confirmed by X-ray photoelec-tron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Figs. S1–S3 in the supplementary material).RTP in the N2 environment for 30 s at temperatures (Tann) of 500 °C and 600 °C was applied after the top TiN dep-osition selectively to some samples, which was performed to examine the PDA effect separately.The structural properties of the as-grown (after the “auto-matic” crystallization) HZLO films and the reference HZO were examined by grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) with Cu Kα radiation using an incident angle of 1°. The spectra were collected with a 0.02° step resolution and integration time as 70 s, with the presence of the 20-nm-thick top TiN layer.The surface morphologies of the as-grown films were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For this purpose, the top TiN electrode was removed in advance by dipping the sample into H2O2 (37%) solution for 15 min at 50 °C. The grain size distributions were extracted from the obtained SEM images by the watershed method imple-mented by the Gwyddion software.28 For electrical measurements, top contact pads with an area of ≈2 × 10−5cm2were formed in the top TiN electrode by a lithographic process followed by a plasma-etching in SF6. Small-signal capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements with an AC signal frequency of 10 kHz and amplitude of 50 mV were used to estimate the dielectric constant (k). Dynamic hysteresis currents were measured in response to the trian-gular voltage sweeps with 0.4 kHz frequency, while P-E hysteresis loops reconstruction was derived by their integra-tion. Endurance measurements were performed by thepositive-up-negative-down (PUND) technique using bipolarcycles with different voltage pulse amplitudes and a cons-tant pulse duration of 0.6 μs (0.2 μs rise and 0.2 μs fall times,FIG. 1.

It is worth noting that the disappear-ance of the monoclinic (111) and (−111) diffraction peak cannot completely prove the absence of the monoclinic phase in the doped HZO thin films in principle. For the case when the film texture is strongly affected by doping concentration, the two main diffraction peaks from the monoclinic phase disappear, but the other diffraction peaks from monoclinic phase can be still observed. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that the La-doping might not significantly change the texture of the La:HZO thin films since diffraction peaks which corre-spond to other phases do not vanish. Moreover, the electrical measurements also support a significant decrease in the monoclinic phase fraction with the disappearance of the monoclinic (111) and (−111) diffraction peaks. Simultaneously, two diffraction peaks at 2θ ≈ 30° and ≈35°, usually attributed to the combination of o/t phases [(111) and (002) reflections, respectively], and, probably, a small contribution from the c-phase also, may give important information about the filmrespectively).structural changes.",342

Here, it should be noted that the diffraction peaks in Fig. 1(a) are quite broad due to the nanoscale size of crystallites. As a result,J. Appl. Phys. 125, 034101 (2019); doi: 10.1063/1.5050700125, 034101-3Published under license by AIP Publishing.Journal of Applied PhysicsARTICLEscitation.org/journal/japsome diffraction peaks can be attributed to the overlap of several diffraction peaks from different crystalline phases. Dey et al. reported that the diffraction peak at ∼35° obtained from Hf1-xZrxO2 thin films can be an overlap of diffraction peaks from the strained tetragonal phase and various ortho-rhombic phases.19,29However, due to the reason above, o- and t-phases cannot be completely separated even with the X-ray from the high-energy synchrotron source.In general, peak shift may be caused by two reasons with different nature. The first one is a mechanical stress and the second reason is the change in relative fractions of dif-ferent crystalline phases such as t- and o-phases, both of which depend on the doping level. In order to gain deeper insights into the reasons for the observed peak shift, the method proposed by Park et al., who focused on the so-called relative ratio (Ra, or the tetragonality value) of different phases was adopted.30,31It was reported that Ra, which is determined as a relative ratio of the longer axis to the shorter axis [c/a for the t-phase and 2a/(b + c) for the o-phase], is significantly different for o- and t-phases.31It should be noted that the longest axis is theoretically a and c for o-phase and t-phase, respectively. Therefore, a and c lattice parame-[Figs. S4(a)–S4(c) in the supplementary material], and their grain size distributions are presented in Fig. 2.As can be seen from this figure, the HZO film showed a peak distribution of the grain size at ≈6 nm of radius with a relatively symmetric distribution with respect to the peak grain size value. In contrast, the HZLO films showed the peak values at the grain diameter of ≈3-5 nm, with much more asymmetric distribution. It can be noted that the distribution has a broad peak near the radius of ≈8-10 nm, which is the main reason for the involvement of the asymmetry. There was no critical difference in the average grain size and its distri-butions between the two differently doped HZLO films. Therefore, the La-doping appears to mainly influence the grains with a smaller diameter in the HZO film and made them even smaller, while the larger grains less influenced. Such observation, however, is not consistent with the authors’ previous report on that the La-addition resulted in the grain growth.23The reason for such discrepancy is most likely ascribed to the imperfectness of the HZO film in the previous work, which involved a high leakage current. Also, the different crystallization processes (automatic in this work vs. RTA in the previous work) may have contributed toterswereextractedfrom themeasuredpeakpositionsthe difference, but further research is necessary to elucidate[Fig. S5(a) in the supplementary material]. In these calcula-tions, no difference between b and c lattice parameters in the o-phase was assumed (it was reported that difference is less than 0.4% even in a bulk phase31). The calculations revealed that the theoretically longest axis (c for the t-phase or a for the o-phase) decreased from ≈5.12 Å down to ≈5.07 Å for the doping level of 0.7 mol. % La and then slightly increases to≈5.08 Å at higher La-concentration. At the same time, the theoretically shortest axis monotonically increases from≈5.07 Å to ≈5.10 Å with the La-concentration increase from 0 to 2.0 mol. %. Interestingly, the theoretically shortest and the longest axis become equal (Ra = 1) at La-concentration of 0.7 mol. %. Meanwhile, Ra monotonically decreases from ≈1.01 to ≈1.00 [Fig. S5(b) in the supplementary material] with the increasing La-concentration in this work, which is consistent with previously reported",1089
CSHwang_La_HfO2_high_endurance_APL_2019.docx,results,".31It is believed that the films in this work have the o- (low La-concentration region) or t-phase (high La-concentration region) structure with a lattice constant very similar to the cubic phase whose Ra is 1. In addition, the investigated films may be under quite high tensile biaxial stress, which has been reported in similar films elsewhere. However, the adopted GIXRD geometry did not permit to estimate the out-of-plane direction strain in this work. Nonetheless, the lattice parameter variations according to the La-concentration indicated that 0.7 mol. % coincided with the point where the film structure under-went a structural phase transition (perhaps coincident to the morphotropic phase boundary), where the FE perfor-mance might be improved.31This was indeed the case as shown below.It has been well reported that the phase evolutions in thin HZO films are largely influenced by the grain size and its distribution.14Therefore, the SEM images of the undoped HZO and 0.7 and 2.0 mol. % of La-doped HZLO were obtainedthe reasons clearly. Next, the electrical properties of the HZLO films according to the La-concentration were examined.Figures 3(a)–3(l) show k-E curves derived from the small signal C-V measurements, and P-E curves of HZO and differ-ent HZLO-based capacitors, respectively. These curves were measured both in “pristine” and in “awakened” (105cycles of bipolar rectangular pulses with 3.0 MV/cm amplitude and 30 μs duration) states (black and red curves, respectively). This is important because the multiple switching may result in significant structural/chemical changes, and consequent electrical modifications due to the so-called wake-up effect.It can be clearly seen that the k-E curves at the pristine state (black lines) qualitatively reproduce the FE behaviors at least for the HZO film and HZLO films with 0.4 mol. % and 0.7 mol. % La, where the obvious peaks in the positive and negative voltage region correspond to Ec and –Ec.

This will be discussed in more detail later.. Both k-E and pinched P-E curves obtained from the sample with 1.0 mol.. % of La at the pristine state indicated a partial AFE-like behavior.. In our previous work, where HZLO with a similar composition was analyzed,23the RTP at 400 °C resulted in a pronounced and quite stable AFE-like behavior..

The partial crystallization of HZLO films could take place during top electrode deposition at 320 °C before the subsequent RTP in the previous work.23Consequently, the behavior of HZLO (1.0 mol.. %) film significantly differs from the previous result.. It can be seen from Fig.. 3( j) that wake-up cycling resulted in the completely depinched P-E hysteresis..

For the case of the film with 0.7 mol. % La, this ratio is ≈1.80 and 1.50 for 2.5 MV/cm and 3.5 MV/cm, respectively. Being compared with the previous result,23where the ratio was as high as ≈3.8, the 2Pr stability was significantly improved too in this sample, which might be ascribed to the different crystallization process (in situ automatic vs. RTP).The breakdown and fatigue in FE films are closely related with the leakage current, because the leakage current induces a cumulative Joule heating and charge trapping effects during the repeated endurance cycles.37,38Therefore, it can be anticipated that the better performance of the optimum La-concentration film against the breakdown and fatigue might be induced from the decreased leakage current, which could be indeed confirmed by Fig. 6(a). It can be understood that the leakage current was largely decreased by the increasing La-concentration in the pristine state. For all the films, the leakage current was increased after the 107cycles at 2.0 MV/cm, but the degree of increase decreased with the increasing La-concentration. However, there is a large deterioration in the FE performance for the films with La-concentration >≈1.0 mol. %. Therefore, the HZLO film with La-concentration of 0.7 mol. % appeared to be the optimum one considering the low leakage current (high reli-ability) and high 2Pr (high performance).To further supplement this",729
CSHwang_La_HfO2_high_endurance_APL_2019.docx,conclusion,", the additional RTP was performed for the 0.7 mol. % HZLO film. Figure 6(b) demonstrates that the RTP incurs a significant rise of the leakages both at the pristine state and after 107times of switching cycles, which induced the significant decay in the reliability as shown in Fig. 7.Figure 7 depicts the adverse influence of RTP to theFIG. 5. Endurance characteristics measured by PUND from HZO and HZLO-based stacks with different La-concentrations. During PUND measure-ments pulse duration remained constant (0.6 μs), while the pulse amplitude varied: (a) 3.5 MV/cm, (b) 3.0 MV/cm, and (c) 2.5 MV/cm.decreased to 3.0 MV/cm with an improvement of the endurance cycle by one order of magnitude for the films with higher La-concentrations, but the similar endurance cycles at lower La-concentrations. The maximum achievable 2Pr values were not significantly deteriorated by the decreased cycle field strength.When the cycle field was decreased to 2.5 MV/cm, the HZLO film with optimum La-concentration (0.7 mol. %) demonstrated a highly promising performance up to 1011 cycles without the breakdown or fatigue, while a reasonably high 2Pr value of ≈28 μC/cm2. In contrast, the HZO film showed a significant fatigue, i.e., the 2Pr value was decreased from ≈18 μC/cm2to ≈9 μC/cm2only after the 1010cycles albeit it was not permanently broken down. The 0.4 mol. % La-doped HZLO film showed an intermediate performance without the breakdown at 1010cycles under the same condi-endurance performance tested at 2.5 MV/cm. Firstly, it is worth noting that the ratio between the remnant polariza-tion in the fully saturated state (e.g., after 108cycles) and pristine state monotonically decreases with the annealing temperature increase (from 1.87 after “automatic annealing”down to 1.42 after 600 °C RTP). Nevertheless, despite the observed possibility to increase the 2Pr value by RTP (for 550-600 °C) at the pristine state, it is evident that even 500 °C annealing leads to the speed-up of the hard break-down. Thus, the switching was limited to ≈4 × 109cycles for any RTP, whereas “no RTP” sample was still working even after the 1011cycles. Thus, the advantage of “in situ” anneal-ing at relatively low-temperature annealing over RTP for the lower leakages and higher reliability of HZLO-based stacks can be confirmed.Finally, the reason why in situ crystallization at 400 °C during TiN deposition can enhance the endurance of HZLO compared to the crystallization processes by the RTP at temperatures >500 °C. There exist two thermally activated processes in ferroelectric doped HfO2 thin films: the forma-tion of the FE o-phase and the formation of oxygen vacancies. The kinetics of the two mechanisms needs to be carefully examined to understand the endurance improvement of thetions.

Meanwhile, the kinetic barrier for a reduction of HfO2 by the adjacent TiN electrode is difficult to estimate, but it should be strongly related to a diffusion of O and N ions. Thus, the kinetic barrier might be comparable to that of oxygen vacancy diffusion. The kinetic barriers of diffusion of doubly ionized and neutral oxygen vacancy are reported to be 0.5-0.7 and 2.4 eV/f.u.,45respectively, which is of ∼1-2 orders higher than that of the t-to-o phase transition. Since a hard breakdown, which is a primary failure mechanism of the doped HfO2, is strongly influenced by diffusion and accumulation of oxygen vacancies, low concentration of oxygen vacancies should be beneficial to achieve large elec-tric field cycle number until breakdown. Therefore, crystalli-zation at a lower temperature can be more effective to achieve a lower concentration of oxygen vacancies in the pristine state, although it can result in a high fraction of the non-ferroelectric t-phase. In this work, nonetheless, a rather long annealing time (4 h) during TiN electrode depo-sition might be useful to increase the o-phase fraction in HZLO thin films. It should be pointed out that such a strat-egy is possible with characteristics of HZLO distinguished from other doped HfO2 systems. Zr is the only alloying element which decreases the crystallization temperature of HfO2, and FE performance can be achieved with the La-concentration even lower than 1.0 mol. %, which should negligibly increase the crystallization temperature of HfO2 thin films.

Pure or partial ferroelec-tric response was demonstrated for lower La-concentrations (<≈1 mol. %), where the optimum ferroelectric performance could be achieved at the La-concentration of 0.7 mol. %. The stable pure antiferroelectric-like response due to the more preferred formation of the tetragonal phase was shown for the highest La-concentration. The most significant merit of the optimized HZLO film with the La-concentration of 0.7 mol. % was as follows. It showed an unprecedented endur-ance cycle up to 1011without the involvement of fatigue and hard breakdown at a cycling field strength of 2.5 MV/cm. The achieved 2Pr after the full wake-up was as high as ≈28 μC/cm2 even with the relatively low driving field strength. The degree of wake-up, i.e., the 2Pr ratio between the woken-up state and the pristine state was lower than half of the previous sample with similar reliability which was crystallized by RTP. Such an improvement was due to the interplay between the lowering leakage current and increasing t-phase formation tendency with the increasing La-concentration. This opti-mized sample also showed degraded reliability performance when it was further processed by RTP at 500-600 °C, which again demonstrates the importance of a low-temperature crystallization (at 400 °C).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSee supplementary material for the details of the La content calculations, XPS data, SEM photographs of the La: HZO film surface, structural analysis, and",500

Both n-type and p-type devices essentially use the same field-effect induced by a FE layer in the gate stack which can have two different but stable polarization states. As a result, two logic states can be distinguished by a shift in the threshold voltage (VT ) of the transistor.However, parasitic charge trapping is one of the challenges the FeFET is currently facing. Positive gate voltages during write operations induce electron trapping in proximity to the HfO2-SiO2 interface, which",642

This is caused by the electrons screening of the FE polarization and its effect onto the channel. The MW recovers only gradually in time as the trapped electrons are released from the gate stack [15]–[17]. Hence a delay of a few hundreds of milliseconds between write and read operation is necessary to clearly distinguish the VT states. Although the de-trapping time and the consequent read latency can be significantly accelerated by suitable de-trapping electrical pulses [18], it is desirable to reduce parasitic charge trapping in the first place. This would enable a minimized read latency, essential for fast and real-time computation with FeFETs.In this letter, the immediate read-after-write in p-type FeFETs on Si substrate is demonstrated.

During read, the drain current (ID) is measured utilizing a fast gate voltage (VG) sweep with a total duration of 100 µs, whereas the polarity of the sweep was adjusted according to the n- or p-type device. The VT is extracted at ID = 100 nA. Write operations are achieved by applying sufficiently large negative (VN) and positive gate voltages (VP), while all other terminals are grounded, resulting in a remanent polarization in the FE pointing up or down, and a respective VT shift. Due to the devices differing polarity these two differing polar-ization states define the high-VT (HVT) and low-VT (LVT) states of the n-FeFET while yielding the LVT and HVT states of the p-FeFET, respectively. The MW is calculated as MW = |HVT - LVT|. To study the read latency after a write pulse, a delay time tD between the write and the following read is inserted (Fig. 1(c)) and varied from 100 µs to 10 s. Fig. 1(d) and (f) shows the ID-VG characteristics of the n-FeFET and p-FeFET, respectively, for both states HVT (blue) and LVT (red) at different tD. The dependence of the corresponding VT is shown in Fig. 1(e) and (g). Notably, the full MW (after tD = 10 s) for both devices is approximately the same and is around 1.5 V, so that no interface adjustment is needed, contrarily to what proposed in [13]. However, the two devices exhibit a completely different behavior in terms of electron de-trapping. The n-FeFET shows the typical behavior as e.g. observed in [16], [18], [19]. While the HVT state characteristics are not influenced by tD, the LVT state characteristics experience aFig. 2.

(c) ID-VG characteristics measured under different read conditions.significant shift with tD, so that VT evolves from 1.5 V to 0 V as tD increases from 100 µs to 1 s. This originates from the electrons trapped by the positive gate pulse necessary to set the LVT state. The trapped electrons require several hundreds of ms to be released from the gate stack again (de-trapping phase), after which the fully saturated LVT state can be observed, yielding the full MW. In marked contrast to this, the p-type FeFET apparently exhibits no de-trapping phase, so that the LVT and HVT characteristics are independent of the tD (Fig. 1(f)) and do not show any shifts of the VT (Fig. 1(g)). In other words, the full MW is available immediately after the write operation, indicating the immediate read-after-write capability.To validate this and to exclude the possibility of any mea-surement artifacts or disturbs in Fig. 1(f-g), we perform two additional tests shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b) in order to assess the VT immediately after the positive VG pulse. Fig. 2(a) depicts a fast readout scheme that collects the ID-VG on the falling edge of the positive gate pulse to exclude any delay between the write and read. Fig. 2(b) shows another delay-free readout scheme wherein a single short gate-pulse of amplitude VR with a total length of 20 µs is applied immediately after the write pulse rather than a VG sweep. Such single point measure-ments are repeated at different VR to capture the full ID-VG.

Hence, the differences should be sought in dissimilar trapping probabilities for the p- and n-type gate-stacks.Although only little attention has been dedicated to this topic, because p-type transistors are generally not exposed to a positive gate stress, some previous studies on conventional p- and n-MOSFETS have already shown that the former are much less prone to the VT degradation under positive bias compared to the latter. The main contributors of this VTinstability were identified as the positive charge injected fromthe gate side and the negative charge (electrons) injected fromthe substrate in the accumulation regime of the p-MOSFET.Nevertheless, it has been found that several factors, such as geometry effects, unfavorable energetic levels for electron trapping as well as shorter emission times for already trapped electrons, give rise to a lower VT degradation upon electron trapping in p-MOSFETs [20]–[24]. It is therefore very likely that this explanation also applies to the absence of VT shifts for our p-FeFETs under positive write voltages.Nevertheless, although this result indicates that p-FeFETs might be more suitable for memory devices compared to the n-FeFETs, still a great caution is needed when fabricating these devices.

La-based higher-κ materials show aggressive EOT scaling (0.5–0.8 nm), but with effective workfunction (EWF) values suitable only for n-type field-effect-transistor (FET). Further exploration for p-type FET-compatible higher-κ materials is needed. Meanwhile, IL scavenging is a promising approach to extend Hf-based high-κ dielectrics to future nodes. Remote IL scavenging techniques enable EOT scaling below 0.5 nm. Mobility-EOT trends in the literature suggest that short-channel performance improvement is attainable with aggressive EOT scaling via IL scavenging or La-silicate formation. However, extreme IL scaling (e.g., zero-IL) is accompanied by loss of EWF control and with severe penalty in reliability. Therefore, highly precise IL thickness control in an ultra-thin IL regime (<0.5 nm) will be the key technology to satisfy both performance and reliability requirements for future CMOS devices.",254
Ando_Scavenging_Gettering_Materials_2012.docx,Introduction,"The rapid progress of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit technology has been accomplished by a calculated reduction of the dimensions of the unit device in the circuit—a practice termed “scaling [1]”. Continued device scaling for future technology nodes requires reduction in equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of gate dielectrics. Extendibility of the conventional SiO(N)/polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) gate structure is challenged due to exponential increase in gate Materials 2012, 5 479leakage currents [2]. As alternatives to SiO(N) gate dielectrics, much work has been done on the research of high permittivity (high-κ) materials [3]. After a decade-long search for the appropriate high-κ materials, the semiconductor industry has converged on Hf-based oxides, such as HfO2 or HfSixOy, for the first generation CMOS products featuring high-κ gate dielectrics and metal gate electrodes (HKMG) [4,5]. The EOT for the first generation HKMG device is approximately 1.0 nm [4]. Continued Lg scaling for the 32 nm and beyond with a planer structure requires sub-nm EOT to suppress short-channel effects. Fully depleted device structures, such as FinFET or extremely thin SOI (ETSOI), improve short-channel control and thus relax the requirements for EOT scaling. However, the insertion point of such device architectures is expected to be the 22 nm and beyond and sub-nm EOT may be still required at those advanced technology nodes. A typical HKMG stack structure contains a silicon oxide based interfacial layer (IL), a high-k dielectric, followed by a metal gate electrode. This system is equivalent to two capacitors connected in series. Thus, the total EOT of the HKMG stack can be expressed as follows. EOT=EOT IL+EOT HK(1) where EOTIL and EOTHK are contributions from the IL and high-κ layer, respectively. An apparent way to scale EOTHK is to reduce the physical thickness of the high-κ layer, however, there is little room in this direction. It has been reported that a thick HfO2 layer causes significant degradations in carrier mobility and charge trapping both with gate-first [6] and gate-last [7] processes. Therefore, the first generation HKMG devices already employ the thinnest possible high-κ layer. This leaves us with three possible EOT scaling approaches: (1) Introduce a new high-κ material with k-value greater than that of HfO2; (2) Increase the k-value of IL; (3) Reduce the physical thickness of IL. In this paper, we review current status and challenges for each approach and discuss the EOT scaling strategy for future CMOS devices. 2. Higher-κ Materials HfO2 is one of the most widely used high-κ materials, showing a k-value of approximately 20. Replacing HfO2 with materials having k-values greater than 20 (higher-κ) is a long term scaling solution. In pursuit of higher-k materials, the tradeoff between k-value and band gap needs to be taken into account. It is generally known that band gap values have a roughly inverse dependence on k-values (Eg~k−0.65) [8]. Therefore, materials with too high k-values typically result in excessive direct tunneling currents and most work showing promising EOT-leakage current density (Jg) characteristics has been achieved with k-value ranging from 20 to 30. Various groups have reported k-value increase in this range by stabilizing the higher-k phase (tetragonal or cubic) of HfO2 via doping of elements such as zirconium [9], yttrium [10], and silicon [11]. This is a practical means to attain a modest k-value increase, however, controllability of crystallinity in an ultra thin HfO2 thickness regime (<2 nm) has yet to be demonstrated. Other groups have suggested La-based higher-k materials such as La-Al-O or La-Lu-O [12]. These materials have recently demonstrated a lot of promise to outperform Hf-based high-κ on a device level [13–16]. A less disruptive way to increase the average k-value of the gate stack is to boost the k-value of the IL in conjunction with Hf-based oxides. A La2O3 cap on a Hf-based high-κ layer has been widely used Materials 2012, 5 480to adjust the threshold voltage (Vt) of n-type field-effect-transistors (nFET) [17]. Some portion of the La elements diffuse through the high-κ layer and form La-silicate IL after high temperature anneals [18]. This is an effective way to increase the k-value of SiO2-based IL. Figure 1(a,b) shows the Z-contrast image and Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) profiles, respectively, obtained by Cs-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) for the SiO2/HfO2/La2O3/TiN/poly-Si stack after a 1,000 °C anneal (after [19]). As seen in Figure 1(b), formation of La-silicate in the IL can be precisely controlled by carefully optimizing the La2O3 layer thickness and the thermal budget, resulting in EOT of 0.58 nm. It was also reported that a single layer of La-silicate gate dielectric scales EOT to a similar value (0.62 nm) [20]. As a potential new alternative, it was recently shown that a thin epitaxial strontium oxide (SrO) interfacial layer prior to HfO2 deposition",1300

EOT values less than 0.80 nm have been achieved with both approaches, however, the aggressive scaling is accompanied with effective workfunction (EWF) shift toward the Si conduction band minimum (CBM) in most cases.. This trend is attributable to formation of electric dipoles at the SiO2/high-κ interface originating from lanthanide (e.g., La, Lu) or alkaline earth (e.g., Sr) metals [23–25].. Formation of such dipoles makes application of these materials to p-type field-effect-transistors (pFET) extremely difficult..

Ando_Scavenging_Gettering_Materials_2012.docx,experiment,"al data suggest that oxygen diffusion through HfO2 or ZrO2 is quite rapid at elevated temperatures and this is not the rate-limiting step for the IL scavenging reaction [29,34]. The EOT trend for metal-inserted poly-Si stack (MIPS) [40] with SiO2/HfO2 dual-layer gate dielectrics in the literature is summarized in Figure 2 as a function of ΔG0 1000 per oxygen atom (ΔG0 1000/O) for the scavenging element. Here, the scavenging element is defined as the metal with the most positive ΔG0 1000/O value (after [41]), existing in either gate dielectrics or workfunction-setting metal layers. For this comparison, data from the early days of gate-first development are also included (Poly-Si gate in [42]; W, TaN, TiN gates in [43]) to understand the IL scavenging process in a historical context. As seen in Figure 2, EOT and ΔG0 1000/O values show a very strong correlation. Poly-Si data point [42] serves as a reference since the ΔG0 1000/O value is zero and neither IL regrowth nor scavenging is expected. Most thermally stable metals studied in the early phase of MGHK development (e.g., W, TaN in [43]) have negative ΔG0 1000/O values, resulting in IL regrowth during high 1000/O value, temperature activation anneals. On the other hand, TiN has a slightly positive ΔG0 providing slight EOT scaling compared to Poly-Si in most cases (e.g., thick TiN in [36,43]). The near Materials 2012, 5 483zero ΔG0 1000/O value may be the main reason why TiN has been widely accepted as a baseline metal electrode throughout the industry. The neutral nature of TiN typically",417
Ando_Scavenging_Gettering_Materials_2012.docx,results,"in neither IL regrowth nor scavenging. However, it is possible to trigger IL scavenging by carefully optimizing the TiN thickness and employing an in-situ cap due to the slightly negative ΔG0 1000/O value (e.g., thin TiN in [36]). In this case, a high thermal budget (>1,000 °C) is required since the driving force of the reaction is not very strong. In order to facilitate the reaction at lower temperatures, scavenging elements with much more positive ΔG0 1000/O values are needed. Such elements, however, come with a severe penalty in thermal stability due to high reactivity with high-κ layers. In fact, early IL scavenging works employ pure transition metals with high ΔG0 1000/O values at relatively low temperatures (300–500 °C [29,31]). Thus, direct capping of very strong scavenging metals may not be compatible with the state-of-the-art CMOS integration requiring higher process temperatures. To overcome this trade-off, we proposed doping of scavenging metals with high ΔG0 1000/O values into a thermally stable TiN electrode [19,34]. This technique enables highly controllable IL scavenging for both gate-first (maximum process temperature: 1,000 °C) [19] and gate-last (maximum process temperature: 600 °C) [37] integrations.

Location of Scavenging Element In this sub-section, we have categorized various IL scavenging techniques into direct-scavenging and remote-scavenging based on the locations of the scavenging elements in the gate stacks. Figure 3 illustrates the difference between the two categories. Direct-scavenging schemes incorporate the scavenging elements within the high-κ layers, whereas the remote-scavenging schemes isolate the scavenging elements from the high-κ layers. Early IL scavenging works fall into the direct-scavenging category since the scavenging metals are incorporated within the high-κ layers either by direct capping [29,30] or by deposition of off-stoichiometric HfO2 [32]. Then, we reported IL scavenging using a TaN-alloy electrode [33]. This technique is still considered direct-scavenging since the scavenging metals diffuse out from the TaN-alloy during a high temperature anneal and end up in the HfO2 layer. The advantage of direct-scavenging is that it does not require such a strong driving force of the reaction (see ΔG0 1000/O",875
Ando_Scavenging_Gettering_Materials_2012.docx,discussion,"in the previous sub-section). Therefore, a relatively weak scavenging metal such as Ti can cause aggressive EOT scaling [29,31]. The downsides of this approach include the following: (1) Effective workfunction change either by inherently low vacuum workfunction of scavenging metals or by formation of fixed charges and/or interface dipoles [29,31]; (2) Excessive carrier mobility degradation and leakage current increase [19]. One elegant way to perform direct-scavenging is to use Hf as a scavenging metal such that it becomes a part of the HfO2 gate dielectric after absorbing oxygen from the IL [30,32]. The degradation in device characteristics due to direct-scavenging can be mitigated to some extent in this way. We proposed the concept of remote-scavenging to completely overcome the aforementioned issues. By doping scavenging elements into a thermally stable TiN electrode with a certain distance from the high-κ/TiN interface, it is possible to cause IL scavenging reaction without out-diffusion of the scavenging elements into the high-κ layer. Such a process enables EOT scaling without extrinsic degradation in carrier mobility and leakage current and with no change in EWF [19]. Another way to carry out remote-scavenging is to employ a thin TiN electrode (~2 nm) with an in-situ Si cap to avoid oxidation from the ambient [35]. These remote-scavenging techniques demonstrated highly controllable EOT scaling and compatibility with advanced CMOS processing. Figure 4 shows cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the HKMG stacks for remote-scavenging with (a) medium scavenging metal dose, (b) high scavenging metal dose (after [19]), and (c) direct scavenging with TaN-alloy (after [33]), respectively. As shown in Figure 4(a,b), the final IL thickness is controllable by changing the scavenging metal dose. It is possible to completely eliminate the initial IL by both remote-scavenging and direct-scavenging (see Figure 4(b,c)). Materials 2012, 5 485Figure 3.

Choice of High-κ Material As shown in Table 2, most IL scavenging works used HfO2 or ZrO2 as gate dielectrics. In order to understand the role of high-κ layer on IL scavenging, we employed doped TiN electrodes on various compositions of HfSixOy layers with the Si/(Hf + Si) ratio ranging from 0.00 (HfO2) to 0.44 and fabricated metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors using gate-first process with a 1,000 °C activation anneal. Reference samples with pure TiN electrodes were also prepared. Figure 5(a) shows EOT reduction by remote IL scavenging (i.e., EOT difference between the doped TiN and the pure TiN) as a function of the Si/(Hf + Si) ratio of HfSixOy. The doping amount of the scavenging metal was Materials 2012, 5 486chosen such that the initial IL (approximately 0.5 nm) is completely removed for HfO2. As the Si/(Hf + Si) ratio is increased, the EOT reduction is similar to that for HfO2 up to Si/(Hf + Si) ratio of 0.20 and then it starts to decrease. This trend indicates that ionic bonds (Hf-O) play a key role in remote-scavenging and the effect is hampered as the ratio of covalent bonds (Si-O) is increased. HfO2 and ZrO2 are very effective mediators of remote-scavenging from this perspective. 3.1.5. Maximum Process Temperature The",1162
Ando_Scavenging_Gettering_Materials_2012.docx,discussion,"in Section 3.1.4 leads us to speculate that oxygen vacancies in ionic metal oxides contribute to remote-scavenging.. We investigated the temperature dependence of remote-scavenging using HfO2 gate dielectrics in order to shed more light on the kinetics of the reaction.. The maximum process temperature after the deposition of doped TiN electrodes was varied from 400 °C to 1,000 °C.. As shown in Figure 5(b), most of the EOT scaling effect from the doped TiN already took place at 600 °C and little further change occurred with the 1,000 °C process (after [34]).. In the case of pure TiN, a slight EOT increase was brought about by the 1,000 °C process.. In contrast, the doped TiN served two purposes.. One is the substantial EOT scaling via IL scavenging at the temperature between 400 and 600 °C.. The other is the suppression of IL regrowth at the higher temperature.. The former reaction coincides with the reported temperature at which oxygen vacancies in a HfO2 layer become mobile and reach a steady state for oxygen transport [44].. We speculate that the IL scavenging reaction proceeds in a remote way as the oxygen vacancies in the HfO2 layer act as mediators for oxygen transport from the IL to the TiN electrode.. Thermal activation of the mobile oxygen vacancies in the HfO2 at 400–600 °C may be the threshold temperature for this reaction, provided that the driving force of the reaction (ΔG0 1000/O) is large enough [34,37].. This reaction model is schematically illustrated in Figure 5(c).. When the driving force of the reaction is small (e.g., TiN), oxygen scavenging itself becomes the rate-limiting step and much higher thermal budget (1,000 °C or higher) is required [36].. Thus, the required thermal budget for remote-scavenging strongly depends on the choice of scavenging element.. As reviewed in this Section, (1) IL growth condition; (2) Choice of scavenging element; (3) Location of scavenging element; (4) Choice of high-κ material; (5) Maximum process temperature, are the key considerations for IL scavenging.. Careful materials and process design suited for the overall integration scheme (e.g., gate-first or gate-last) is indispensable for the implementation of IL scavenging in state-of-the-art CMOS devices..

Ando_Scavenging_Gettering_Materials_2012.docx,introduction,"of high-κ dielectrics brings about additional degradation in each Eeff regime. In the low Eeff regime, fixed charges in the high-κ layer or interface dipoles localized at the IL/high-κ interface cause remote Coulomb scattering (RCS) [63–66]. In the middle Eeff regime, Fischetti et al. predicted that soft optical phonons in high-κ layers can couple with carrier electrons, resulting in remote phonon scattering (RPS) [62]. In the high Eeff regime, either the fluctuation of permittivity of high-κ layers or the surface roughness at the IL/high-κ interface can cause remote surface roughness scattering (r-SRS) [19,64]. All of these additional scattering mechanisms are predicted to show strong dependences on the IL thickness. Therefore we studied the impacts of remote IL scavenging and La-(Al-) induced IL modification on electron mobility. Figure 9. (a) Relative change of positive bias temperature instability (PBTI) and negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) lifetime with gate oxide thickness change via IL scavenging; (b) Relative change of time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) lifetime for nFET and pFET with gate oxide thickness change via IL scavenging (after [61]).

Ando_Scavenging_Gettering_Materials_2012.docx,experiment,"al data for remote IL scavenging delineate a straight tradeoff line, which is slightly steeper and shifted downwards from the prediction based on the RPS theory. The deviation is attributable to the additional RCS from the fixed charges [65] and/or interface dipoles [66] at the SiO2/HfO2 interface. It is interesting to note that the trend line for the La-induced dipole is identical to that of the intrinsic IL scaling, indicating no additional RCS. In contrast, the Al-induced dipole brought about additional RCS at a fixed IL thickness. This difference may originate from the silicate forming nature of La [68], resulting in long-range and low density electric dipoles [27]. Thus, La-silicate IL is a promising EOT scaling knob (see Section 2) with no additional mobility degradation, although it is only suitable for nFET due to the EWF shift toward the Si CBM (see Table 1). On the other hand, the mobility degradation in the high Eeff regime is solely limited by SRS [19,34]. Li and Ma predicted that roughness at the remote interface from the channel can degrade the carrier mobility depending on the oxide thickness (TIL) and the average deviation of TIL(ΔTIL) [69]. We speculate that r-SRS from the SiO2/HfO2 interface is the origin of the mobility degradation, resulting in a strong IL-thickness dependence of high field electron mobility. Figure 11 shows high field electron mobility as a function of EOT from literature data including remote IL scavenging [19,36], direct IL scavenging using Hf [32], La-silicate IL with HfO2 [19,33], and single-layer La-silicate [20]. It should be noted that all data fall on the same line with a slope of approximately 20 cm2/Vs per 0.1 nm scaling, showing the universality of our IL thickness dependent mobility model in the ultra-thin EOT regime [19,34]. Moreover, negligible impact of La-induced dipoles on mobility is evidenced by the convergence of the IL scavenging trend and the La-silicate trend. Materials 2012, 5 493Figure 11. High field electron mobility as a function of EOT from literature data including remote IL scavenging [19,36], direct IL scavenging using Hf [32], La-silicate IL with HfO2 [19,33], and single-layer La-silicate [20]. The mobility values are taken at Ninv = 1 × 1013 cm−2 in [36] and at Eeff = 1 MV/cm in all other work. Simulated contour lines providing the same Ion at Lmin 16, 22, and 30 nm are shown for comparison (after [75]). High Field Electron Mobility (cm2/Vs)300Materials 2012, 5 494indicates that it is indeed possible to improve the short-channel device performance by employing IL scaling in conjunction with aggressive Lg scaling in future nodes albeit with some electron mobility degradation. The key to realize performance improvement going in this direction is to follow the ideal IL scaling trend by optimizing the IL scavenging process and/or by employing a silicate IL which does not cause additional carrier scattering (e.g., La-silicate). Although, IL scaling can provide performance improvement, extreme IL scaling (e.g., zero-IL) ends up with loss of EWF control both in gate-first and gate-last processes (see Section 3.3) and with severe penalty in reliability (see Section 3.4). Therefore, a highly controllable IL scavenging technique which can adjust the IL thickness to the optimum point where both performance and reliability requirements are satisfied is required. Such IL thickness control has been demonstrated for remote IL scavenging by changing the scavenging metal dose in the TiN electrodes [19,34,37] or by adjusting the TiN thickness with the in-situ Si cap [35,36]. These are encouraging techniques to extend Hf-based high-κ dielectrics toward the end of the CMOS roadmap. 4.",928
Ando_Scavenging_Gettering_Materials_2012.docx,Conclusion,"s EOT scaling into the sub-nm regime has been accomplished by various approaches. La-based higher-κ materials and La-silicate IL with HfO2 showed aggressive EOT values (0.5–0.8 nm), but with large EWF shifts toward the Si CBM, limiting their application to nFET. Further exploration for pFET-compatible higher-κ materials is needed. Meanwhile, IL scavenging is a promising approach to extend Hf-based high-κ dielectrics to future nodes. Remote-scavenging techniques enable EOT scaling below 0.5 nm. The key considerations for IL scavenging are (1) IL growth condition; (2) Choice of scavenging element; (3) Location of scavenging element; (4) Choice of high-κ material and (5) Maximum process temperature. Careful materials and process choice based on these considerations is indispensable. Mobility-EOT trends in the literature suggest that short-channel performance improvement is attainable with aggressive EOT scaling via IL scavenging or La-silicate formation. However, extreme IL scaling is accompanied with loss of EWF control and with severe penalty in reliability. Therefore, highly precise IL thickness control in an ultra-thin IL regime (<0.5 nm) will be the key technology to satisfy both performance and reliability requirements for future CMOS devices.",284

Metal-ferroelectric-insulator-silicon capacitors, with a thin layer of hafnium zirconium oxide grown by atomic layer deposition as the ferroelectric and various interfacial oxide layers as the insulator, are investigated. Since a high-temperature post-annealing is necessary to induce the formation of the ferroelectric phase in this oxide stack, the integrity of the oxide/silicon inter-face must be preserved after high-temperature processing. As such, we show that a nitrided interlayer provides an improved midgap interface state density among all interfa-cial oxides investigated.

This critical discovery bodes well for the design of low-powerembedded, non-volatile memory and negative capacitancetransistor devices [2], [7], [8].

The atomic layer deposition (ALD) process can be tuned to produce a high quality HfO2-based gate oxide, but the subse-quent stabilization of the ferroelectric phase involves a moder-ately high temperature anneal (commonly 400 °C or higher), which may perturb the interface between oxide and silicon. The effects of this so-called phase anneal on film crystallinity are well-documented [10], [11], but the effects on interfacial properties are yet to be properly understood.In this letter, we investigate the effects of the ferroelectric phase anneal on the interface properties of a MOSCAP device. By utilizing the AC conductance technique proposed by Nicollian and Goetzberger [12], the midgap trap density (Dit) is measured directly. Furthermore, we show that a nitrided interfacial layer between hafnium zirconium oxide (HZO) and the silicon substrate minimizes degradation of the interface during the ferroelectric phase anneal, yielding a device with a peak midgap trap density in the mid-1011cm−2eV−1range, which is amenable for modern day device technologies.II.",810

After the first cycles, an increase in remanent polarization—the so-called“wake-up” behavior—is often observed which saturates after a certain number of cycles.5Further field cycling causes areductionoftheferroelectricresponse—theso-calledfatigue—which is often terminated by the dielectric break-down.6Manifold ideas were presented explaining all these phenomena such as a change in the crystallographic phase composition during cycling,7–9electron trapping,10,11and oxygen vacancy diffusion.7,12However, most of these approaches are based on a certain",265

The field cycling phenomena were recently analyzed by Pe�sic´ et al.7 An approach focused on simulation was taken in that work. So far, it seems to be well established that an initial internal bias field caused by unequally distributed charges locally inhibits the ferroelectric domains of both polarities from switching.13This causes a constriction of the ferroelectric hysteresis.14These local internal bias fields are reduced dur-ing field cycling which is caused by a homogenization of the charge distribution.15An additional phenomenon observed in all ferroelectrics is the imprint.16The imprint",143

By the in-situ measurement of the time and temperature-dependent imprint of the hyster-esis, we reveal that electron trapping is an important cause. Furthermore, by using a two-step waveform,17we are able to reset the film into a pristine-like state by generating two oppositely biased switching distributions. The field cycling behavior of these films shows wake-up-like behavior again. Charges trapped in defects result in a local shift of the coer-cive field and are therefore proposed to be the cause of the reduced ferroelectric response in the pristine state. This can be described as a local imprint effect.II.",269

The Hf:Zr pulse ratio was 1:1 to achieve the most homogeneous distribution of hafnia and zirconia in the film. TiN electrodes were deposited before and after ferroelectric deposition using reactive sputtering from a Ti-target as reported before.18To achieve crystallization, the metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitors were annealed at 600�C for 20 s in a nitro-gen atmosphere. After annealing, metal contacts consisting of 10 nm Ti as an adhesion layer and 50 nm Pt were depos-ited via electron beam evaporation through a shadow mask.0021-8979/2018/123(20)/204101/8/$30.00123, 204101-1Published by AIP Publishing.204101-2Fengler et al.J.

fengler_miko_retention_APL_2018.docx,DISCUSSION,"To characterize the crystal structure of the HZO films after annealing, grazing incidence XRD measurements were conducted. The resulting diffraction pattern (see Fig. 1) shows a high peak at about 30�. A closer analysis reveals that the films likely contain a high portion of the orthorhom-bic or tetragonal phase together with a small fraction of monoclinic grains (compare inset in Fig. 1).To assess the ferroelectric endurance properties, the capacitor structures were cycled with 3 MV/cm using rectan-gular voltage pulses with 100 kHz. In between, the remanent polarization was measured using triangular voltage pulses with 10 kHz [see Fig. 2(a)]. The positive polarization state was achieved by applying a positive voltage to the top elec-trode, whereas the negative polarization state was achieved by applying a negative voltage to the top electrode while the bottom electrode remained grounded. Typical ferroelectric properties of the film were observed. The positive and nega-tive remanent polarization of 10 lC/cm2in the pristine state increased during the first 104cycles to 13 lC/cm2. Further field cycling led to a reduction of the ferroelectric response, which corresponds to the fatigue phenomenon.For the pristine state, the woken up state (after 104 cycles), and the fatigued state (after 108cycles), capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements were conducted using an ac-signal of 70 mV and a dc bias ranging from �3 V to 3 V. As can be seen in Fig. 2(b), an asymmetry in the CV-hysteresis isFIG. 1. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction",359

No significant change in capacitance for highfields at 3 MV/cm was observed during wake-up. The missingchange in capacitance shows that either the contribution of thephase change to the increased polarization is very low or theinvolved phases have similar permittivities. Unlike for films doped, e.g., with Gd,19a strong contribution of the phasechange is not expected for hafnia zirconia due to the widerprocess concentration window and the higher stability of theorthorhombic phase compared to other doped HfO2 films. However, for the fatigued state, a clear increase in the capaci-tance can be seen. Two different mechanisms could be respon-sible: A partial phase change to the tetragonal phase20or the domain wall pinning mechanism.21During field cycling, the concentration of charged oxygen vacancies increases,10which can stabilize higher symmetry phases of hafnia.22–24Thiswould lead to a higher permittivity, which increases the capac-itance of the stack. However, it is also suggested that oxygen204101-3Fengler et al.J. Appl. Phys. 123, 204101 (2018)vacancies accumulate at the grain boundaries in the fatigued state,25which might lead to domain wall pinning. These pinned domain walls bend during application of an external field causing an increase in capacitance as well.21Both mech-anisms would reduce the ferroelectric switching density and could play a role during fatigue. More research has to be done, e.g., by a TEM analysis or microspot XRD to distin-guish both effects.With respect to the imprint mechanism, it is known that the shift of the hysteresis while storing in a specific polariza-tion state is enhanced for woken up films.17During electric field cycling, the unpinned domains are oriented into one switching direction. The subsequent storage causes a shift of the whole hysteresis along the voltage axis—the imprint.26 The reported dependence of the imprint on the temperature and time17showed a different slope of the hysteresis shift along the voltage axis as a function of time for room temper-ature compared to higher temperatures. However, the pub-lished extracted activation energy for the imprint in ferroelectric hafnia-zirconia films17contained an additional relaxation process and is therefore misleading: Since the sample was measured at room temperature after exposure to high temperature to determine the imprint, the thermal relax-ation of defects also played a role. The extracted activation energy of about 1 eV therefore represents more likely the thermal relaxation activation energy for an electron in a dou-bly positively charged oxygen vacancy which has a similar value.27 To be able to extract the activation energy that is charac-teristic purely for the imprint process itself, we measured the shift of the coercive voltage VC in situ at the respective tem-perature. To reach this result, TiN/HZO/TiN capacitors were preconditioned with 106cycles at room temperature at 100 kHz and 3 MV/cm to achieve a woken-up state (compare Fig. 2). Subsequently, the sample was heated up to the desired temperature and then cycled again for 104cycles to reset the already started imprint and shift the PV-hysteresis back into its initial position. Directly after cycling, a PV hys-teresis measurement was conducted and repeated after a cer-tain time delay. The imprint was then calculated from the shift of the PV hysteresis using the difference in coercive voltage of both measurements. This procedure was repeated for various times and temperatures. The corresponding mea-surement",1037
fengler_miko_retention_APL_2018.docx,results,"are plotted in Fig. 3(a).A clear shift of the hysteresis was observed for all tem-peratures. The direction of the shift to more negative vol-tages is typical for the sample in the positive polarization state while the shift towards more positive voltages would be expected for negatively polarized samples. Moreover, the slopes of the shift as a function of time in the Arrhenius plot of all temperatures were quite similar. Solely for room tem-perature, a slight remaining difference was observed. The obtained activation energies for the imprint were extracted as 0.099 6 0.01 eV including the 25�C data point and as 0.079 6 0.003 eV excluding it [see Fig. 3(b)]. This points towards electrons as responsible charge carriers since activa-tion energy is too low for ion diffusion.28,29This is in good agreement with thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC)",198

Volume effects describe the suppression of polariza-tion in the ferroelectric by reorientation of polar lattice defects.30On the contrary, domain wall pinning and seed inhibition both describe the suppression of ferroelectric switching by blocking single domains. This occurs either at domain seeds (seed inhibition)31or at the domains walls (domain wall pinning).21Colla et al.21showed that it is pos-sible to cause a strong reduction of polarization of PZT by cycling a sample with a two-step waveform [see Fig. 4(a)] that applies a voltage for 300 s which is close to the coercive field prior to switching. This method allowed distinguishing between domain wall pinning and the other two effects since it maximizes the number of domain walls. The same204101-4Fengler et al.J. Appl.

Due tothe missing change in capacitance,17it can be assumed that seed inhibition or volume effects rather than domain wall pinning are dominating. Since the seeds can be located close to the electrodes or within a grain at inter-grain phase bound-aries,33it is not possible to distinguish the effects further.204101-5Fengler et al.J. Appl. Phys. 123, 204101 (2018)Considering the extracted activation energy of the imprint and the fact that both phenomena—the imprint and the wake-up—already occur at room temperature, it seems possible that the same mechanism can be responsible for both of them. During application of the low voltage step close to the coercive field, the domains with lower coercive field values are switched. This increases the chance to pin the domains in opposite directions. A local bias field is caused which shifts one half of the hysteresis towards nega-tive and the other half towards positive fields resulting in the observed split up of the switching density. However, due to the applied field during the low voltage step, some domains remain unpinned or are sequentially unpinned, which explains the remaining portion of domains without bias field in the FORC distribution.17 To further analyze this assumption, the pristine films were pre-cycled for 106cycles at 100 kHz with 3 MV/cm as shown in Fig. 2 to reach the woken up state. Subsequently, the two-step waveform as shown in Fig. 4(a) was applied 40 times using 3 MV/cm for the maximum field and 1.2 MV/cm for the low field step. In the last cycle, only the low positive field was applied to the capacitor to switch a portion of the domains into the opposite direction. The films were stored for 30 min at different temperatures, cooled down quickly to room temperature to measure the FORC distribution that can be compared to the one obtained before the treatment.From Fig. 4(b), it is visible how the local internal bias fields of the pristine film diminish due to the electric field cycling into the woken up state [Fig. 4(c)]. The negative switching density and the positive values right next to them in the FORC distribu-tion (EC � 2MV/cm) in Fig. 4(b) are a measurement artifact caused by a shift of one of the switching current peaks during the FORC measurement. The reason for this is that in the calcu-lation of the FORC distribution, it is assumed that the switching current peaks do not shift during the measurement itself (see Ref. 15 for a detailed",1179
fengler_miko_retention_APL_2018.docx,discussion,"of the FORC method).. Nevertheless, all other FORC distribution peaks shown in Fig.. 4 are related to the real response of the ferroelectric sample.. After application of the two-step waveform, two local bias fields emerge [as shown in Fig.. 4(d)].. These bias fields are strongly increasing with higher temperature during the bake [compare Figs.. 4(d)–4(f)].. Clearly, it is visible how the remaining unpinned domains without bias field are imprinted with increas-ing temperature.. Additionally, a capacitor was pre-cycled for 106cycles at 100kHz with 3MV/cm as before.. Instead of a two-step waveform, just a single sub-cycling pulse was applied: First, all domains were switched with 3MV/cm for 100 ls in one direction and subsequently a portion was switched with�1.2MV/cm for 100 ls into the opposite polarization state.. Afterwards, the sample was baked as before for 30min at 125�C.. Similar bias field distributions as for the case with the two-step waveform cycled capacitor were achieved.. Due to the opposite polarity of the poling voltages, opposite portions of peak maxima for the negative and positive bias fields were achieved compared to the two-step measurements before.. Since no additional pulses were applied (in contrast to the two-step cycling), the split up was much clearer and almost no domains without bias field were present, as can be seen in Fig.. 4(g).. The overall dependence of the bias fields on the baking temperature due to imprint shows strong similarities to the wake-up phenom-enon.. Using a bake at 200�C for 30min even causes the unpinned domain portions to merge with the already imprinted portion with positive bias [see Fig.. 4(f)].. This bias field distribu-tion is similar to the pristine distribution.. However, it is not fully possible to go back into a truly pristine state due to the possibil-ity that during field cycling, 90�domains might re-orientate.33 This is possible since the a-axis and the c-axis of the unit cell have a similar length.20Therefore, a reorientation of domains without a significant volume change of the unit cell seems to be possible.. In contrast, the local bias fields after the two-step waveform and the bake should contain highly oriented domains which are more strongly pinned..",512
fengler_miko_retention_APL_2018.docx,results,". The resulting thermally stimulated depolarization current as a function of the temperature [see Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)] reveals two strongly overlapping peaks with maxima at about 250�C and 350�C. Fengler et al.10already showed that the diffusion of singly and doubly positively charged oxygen vacancies can cause these peaks, whereas dipole reorientation or trapped charges as cause were excluded. It was also presented how to use the thermal cleaning method and estimate the amount of charged oxygen vacancies by fit-ting the dependence of the integrated charges on the applied poling voltage to a sinh function.10 The same method was applied to the 10 nm HZO films investigated here. Oxygen vacancy concentrations in a simi-lar range of �0.2% for the singly and �0.1% for the doubly positively charged oxygen vacancies as a portion of the threefold coordinated oxygen atoms O3in the film were extracted as in Ref. 10. The fact that no significant oxygen vacancy diffusion was observed for temperatures below 100�C under the measurement conditions [compare Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)] corroborates the assumption that ion migration is not the dominating factor for wake-up and imprint which occurs already at room temperature.10 Additionally, we measured the concentration of defects for both polarities of the poling voltage using the TSDC method and the described approach by utilizing a sinh fitting function. A higher amount of diffused charges was observed for positive voltage at the top electrode compared to a nega-tive voltage. Since a positive voltage should repel the posi-tively charged oxygen vacancies, this might hint at a higher concentration of the oxygen vacancies at the top electrode.This is in good agreement with the observed asymmetry in the CV-measurements [compare Fig. 2(b)] and earlier publications claiming that an asymmetry should be caused by a stronger oxidation of the bottom electrode during the ALD compared to a minimal oxidation of the TiN top elec-trode during the crystallization anneal process.35During the high temperature anneal, the chemical reduction of the HZO is expected to generate a lower amount of oxygen vacancies at the bottom interface compared to the top interface.36To describe our",484

fengler_miko_retention_APL_2018.docx,CONCLUSION,"The field cycling behavior of ferroelectric hafnia zirco-nia films was analyzed.. During field cycling, typical wake-up and fatigue behavior was observed.. The negligible change in the dielectric constant of the films with cycling suggests that during the wake-up, no pronounced phase change into a phase with a significantly different permittivity occurs.. On the other hand, the capacitance change during fatigue remains unclear making the interpretation of the capacitance values without further structural or electrical data rather speculative.. Due to an increased capacitance of the film, a phase change or a domain wall pinning is suspected.. However, an asymmetry was observed in the capacitance-voltage curves, which hints towards an electrode dependent asymmetry in the capacitor stack.. The analysis of the depen-dence of the thermally stimulated depolarization currents might point to a higher oxygen vacancy concentration at the top electrode compared to the bottom electrode; however, further analyses with other characterization techniques are necessary to confirm these data.. An improved approach to investigate the cause of imprint showed, however, that elec-tron trapping at the defect sites—most likely oxygen vacan-cies—takes place.. By application of a two-step waveform and a subsequent bake, we show that a similar state as the pristine one can be caused by just splitting up the domains 204101-8 Fengler et al.. J. Appl..

A key focus for this approach is to ensure that the in-package connectivity can both perform with low overhead and support similar bandwidth and connection densities as on-die interconnects. This can be made possible by using the hybrid bonding technology [6,7] to replace the conventional solder bond technology to significantly increase the vertical density of connections/area for die-to-wafer and/or wafer-to-wafer stacking. Another novel approach is Omni-Directional Interconnect (ODI), as shown in Figure 14, which allows (i) a high bandwidth fine pitch connection of top die to base die, (ii) a bottom die to package connection for power and IO, and (iii) a new direct connection of top die to package that supports direct power delivery comparable to monolithic implementations.

Although SrTiO3 is promising because it contains a κ > 100, the dielectric thickness of the low metal/insulator barrier height (ϕb) must be increased to lower the leakage current [2]. This is the fundamental material-related problem of high-κ dielectric materials, of which the ϕb decreases as the κ value increases. Nevertheless, the relativelylarge thickness is difficult to fill into the smaller footprintof the DRAM capacitor. Therefore, increasing the capacitorheight is one solution to continuous downscaling of the planarsize of DRAM cell, but the increased aspect ratio increasesthe difficulty of fabricating the DRAM capacitor.

Sayeef_1nm_HfO2_FE_Nature_2020.docx,results,"from TEM and literature13.Structural distortion analysis. For the polar orthorhombic phase (Pca21), we consider the orthorhombic distortion (that is, orthorhom-bicity) as the aspect ratio: 2c/(a + b) to enable easier comparison to the tetragonal (P42/nm) aspect ratio c/a. Fluorite-structure orthorhombic-ity is meant to be analogous to the perovskite ferroelectric tetragonal-ity (c/a, where c is the polar axis); both aspect ratios serve as a struc-tural gauge of the macroscopic polarization because they are indicative of the polar distortion present in their respective structures53. Notably, the orthorhombic distortion present in HZO is enhanced in the ultrathin regime—opposite to the typical tetragonal distortion trend in perovs-kite ferroelectrics6—indicative of the ‘reverse’ size effects present in fluorite-structure ferroelectrics. For example, the tetragonal aspect ratio was shown to decrease with decreasing thickness in ferroelectric PbTiO3 films53, while the orthorhombic aspect ratio is greatly enhanced in the ultrathin regime in our fluorite-structure HZO films (Fig. 3g). The orthorhombic distortion present in ten-cycle (about 1 nm) HZO far exceeds any reported values for HfO2-ZrO2 polymorphs: we find >11% aspect asymmetry, while 3–4% is typically reported for fluorite-structure ferroelectrics31, consistent with our thicker films (Fig. 3g). Indeed, a strong relationship between this aspect ratio and the remanent po-larization value has been",401
Sayeef_1nm_HfO2_FE_Nature_2020.docx,experiment,"ally demonstrated in thicker doped HfO2 films54. Therefore, the colossal orthorhombic aspect ratio present in ten-cycle HZO is consistent with ultrathin-enhanced ferro-electricity. The orthorhombic aspect ratio is calculated from the posi-tion of various diffraction peaks indexed to the Pca21 phase (the 200, 020 and 002 peaks), using the following crystallographic relations: a = 2·d200, b = 2·d020, c = 2·d002 where d200, d020, and d002 are the 200, 020 and 002 lattice spacings determined via Bragg’s law and the respective peak positions. These values are self-consistently checked against the 111 interplanar lattice spacing ( 1/ d 111 2 = 1/ a 2 + 1/ b 2 + 1/ c 2 ) as well as against other orientations present in the diffraction spectra. The aspect ratio of the polar O-phase exceeds that of the T-phase (c/a) for doped HfO2 54. Another structural marker indicates amplified distortions as thickness is reduced, namely the interplanar lattice spacing d111. The origin of the left shift in the O-phase 111 (T-phase 101) reflection (Fig. 3f) with decreasing thickness (that is, decreasing ALD cycles) is typically attributed to the abovementioned phase transition (nonpolar T-phase to polar O-phase); the left shift of the peak in reciprocal space corre-sponds to an increase in real-space lattice spacing. Extending this analogy to the ultrathin regime in which the polar O-phase is already stabilized, the ultrathin enhancement of d111 (Fig. 3g) indicates a further increase in rhombic distortion (structurally represented by d111). Recent works on epitaxial HZO films grown by high-temperature pulsed laser deposition on perovskite substrates also indicate increasing d111 with decreasing thickness28,29; these works find the electric polarization to increase with increasing d111. Similarly, we expect a larger polarization in our ultrathin films based on the d111 trend (Fig. 3g); notably, our low-temperature ALD-grown highly oriented films are mimicking the trends observed in high-temperature pulsed-laser-deposition-grown epitaxial films.X-ray spectroscopy XAS and XLD. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and XLD was per-formed at the Advanced Light Source beamline 4.0.2. XAS measure-ments were taken at the oxygen K edge (520–550 eV) and Zr M2 edge (345–355 eV). X-rays were incident at 20° off grazing. XLD (XAS) was obtained from the difference (average) of horizontal and vertical linear-ly polarized X-rays. To eliminate systematic artefacts in the signal that drift with time, spectra were captured with the order of polarization rotation reversed (such as horizontal, vertical, vertical and horizontal) in successive scans. An elliptically polarizing undulator was used to tune polarization and photon energy of the synchrotron X-ray source55. XAS was recorded under total electron yield mode55.Simulated XAS and crystal field symmetry. Simulated XAS spectra for the various fluorite-structure polymorphs were computed through the Materials Project56 open-source database for the XAS spectrum57. In particular, the following symmetries for HfO2 and ZrO2 were inves-tigated: monoclinic P21/c (space group 14), orthorhombic Pca21 (space group 29), and tetragonal P42/nmc (space group 137). Comparisons between HZO and the undoped fluorite-structure endmembers (in particular, qualitative comparison of splitting-induced spectroscopy features) are reasonable owing to the extremely low structural dis-similarity between the same polymorphs of HfO2 and ZrO2, as deter-mined by pymatgen58. The T-phase (P42/nmc) nonpolar distortion (D4h, fourfold prismatic symmetry) from regular tetrahedral (Td, full tetra-hedral symmetry) fluorite-structure symmetry does not split the degenerate e bands (d x 2−y 2 , d 3 z 2−r 2), as confirmed by",977
Sayeef_1nm_HfO2_FE_Nature_2020.docx,experiment,"59 and the XAS simulations (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Meanwhile, the O-phase (Pca21) polar rhombic pyramidal distortion (C2v, twofold pyramidal symmetry) does split the e-manifold based on crystal field symmetry (Extended Data Fig. 9b), providing a spectroscopic means to distinguish the T- and O-phases. The eightfold Hf-O (Zr-O) coordination (Extended Data Fig. 9d) in the tetragonal phase (D2d point group symmetry) can be decomposed into two tetrahedra that are the space inversion twins of one another. Therefore, crystal field splitting of the e levels matches that of a single tetrahedron59—that is, there is no further splitting. Mean-while, the sevenfold Hf-O (Zr-O) coordination (Extended Data Fig. 9d) in the orthorhombic phase cannot be decomposed into two tetrahedra; the additional rhombic distortion (not present in the T-phase) splits the e manifold. The simulated XAS spectra for T- and O-phase ZrO2 (Extended Data Fig. 9b) supports this picture, because the additional spectroscopic feature present between the main e- and t2- absorption features in the O-phase is presumably caused by this additional symmetry-lowering distortion. The XAS spectra of the HZO thickness series (Extended Data Fig. 9c) demonstrates tetrahedral and rhombic splitting features closely matching the polar O-phase (Pca21). This demonstrates a spectroscopic method for phase identification beyond diffraction—ambiguous owing to the nearly identical T- and O-phase lattice parameters13—whose signatures are more sensitive to the subtle structural distortions present as symmetry is lowered from the T- to the O-phase.Crystal field splitting. Notably, the crystal field distortions present in confined HZO films greatly exceed what is typically observed in bulk fluorite-structures and perovskite ferroelectrics (Extended Data Fig. 9g); the tetrahedral (rhombic) crystal field ∆T (∆R) arising from the Td (C2v) symmetry in ten-cycle HZO films is 1.3 eV (0.7 eV) greater than what is expected from fluorite-structure ZrO2 in the polar orthorhombic phase (Pca21). The computational XAS for the Pca21 phase already takes the polar distortion (∆R) into account; so the enhanced ∆R in ultrathin confined films again points to enhanced polar distortions (consist-ent with diffraction-based",585
Sayeef_1nm_HfO2_FE_Nature_2020.docx,results,"). Kindred efforts to uncover routes towards enhanced nanoscale distortions have been explored in com-plex perovskite heterostructures. For example, in nickelate perovskite superlattices, enormous ∆eg crystal field splitting (up to 0.8 eV) has been achieved via polar fields resulting from internal charge transfer27; >10% epitaxial strain would be required to induced such large ionic distortions in that particular system, well beyond the limits of epitaxial strain, which can only achieve eg splitting of about 300 meV (ref. 60).Spectral weight trends. The relative spectral weight of the e and t2 manifolds (Extended Data Fig. 9c) at the O K edge can also provide insight into the degree of structural distortion61. Owing to the d0 elec-tronic configuration present in Hf4+ (Zr4+), all d states are available for mixing with O 2p states, so the analysis of e-t2 spectral weight can be simplified to be purely due to crystal field effects61. Tetrahedral sym-metry lowers e bands relative to t2 bands due to the enhanced t2 orbital overlap with oxygen 2p orbitals. The enhanced t2/e spectral weight as thickness is reduced (Extended Data Fig. 9c) indicates the preference for O 2p hybridization with Hf 5d (Zr 4d) t2 orbitals, further exaggerating the disparity set by the tetrahedral symmetry as the symmetry is lowered to the polar O-phase. Additionally, the increase in spectral weight of the pre-edge shoulder (Extended Data Fig. 9e) provides further confir-mation that structural distortions are amplified in the ultrathin limit. Pre-edge features at the O K edge in complex transition metal oxides are commonly attributed to nearest-neighbour variations from typical oxygen polyhedral coordination as the symmetry is lowered by various distortions62. Analogously, here the pre-edge feature is attributed to variation from eightfold coordination in the T-phase (NN = 8) as the sym-metry is lowered into the polar O-phase (NN = 7) (Extended Data Fig. 9d). On the unit cell level in the polar O-phase, the central metal cation is surrounded by an asymmetric oxygen coordination environment (note the 4 blue and 3 cyan oxygen atoms in Extended Data Fig. 9d) owing to the polar rhombic distortion of normal tetrahedral (Td) symmetry; this polyhedral distortion can manifest as increased spectral weight at the oxygen K pre-edge62. The critical e manifold splitting due to the polar rhombic distortion also increases in spectral weight as thickness is reduced (Extended Data Fig. 9c). The XAS spectral weight trends mir-ror the structural indicators of ultrathin-enhanced distortion (Fig. 3c).Orbital polarization. In conjunction with XAS, XLD can also probe structural distortions owing to its sensitivity to orbital asymmetry, which can arise from inversion symmetry breaking. For example, in the perovskite ferroelectrics PbTiO3 and BaTiO3, the Ti 3d to O 2p orbital hybridization is essential for stabilizing the noncentrosymmetric struc-ture63. Particularly at the 3d cation L3,2 edge, orbital polarization extract-ed from XLD is used as a measure of the oxygen octahedral distortion in perovskites owing to the anisotropic hybridization between cation 3d and O 2p orbitals64. Accordingly, in fluorite-structure ferroelectrics, the magnitude of XLD present at the Zr M3,2 edges can be a gauge of the degree of polyhedral distortion (in this case, a distortion of the oxygen tetrahedron) and the oxygen atomic asymmetry. Indeed, the orbital polarization at the Zr M2 edge is enhanced as the thickness is reduced from the thick (100-cycle) to ultrathin (ten-cycle) regime (Fig. 3c), consistent with diffraction-based",864
Sayeef_1nm_HfO2_FE_Nature_2020.docx,results,"demonstrating amplified structural distortions in the ultrathin limit. Spectroscopy can also help understand the evolution to highly textured films in the ultrathin limit (Fig. 3e, f), as XLD enables both element- and orbital-specific infor-mation by comparing polarization-dependent XAS spectra. GI-XRD across the thickness series (Fig. 3f) indicates that the degree of orien-tation substantially changes as the HZO drops below about 2.5 nm (25 cycles). The microstructure change below 25 cycles also manifests as inverted orbital polarization at the oxygen K edge, particularly at the e manifold (Fig. 3b). Absorption of vertically and horizontally polarized light preferentially probes the polar-distortion-split e levels (the x2y2 and 3z2r2d orbitals); the reversal of XLD sign indicates these levels are inverted with respect to one another. In perovskites, such a change in orbital polarization is often attributed to different signs of tetragonal distortion (c/a) of the oxygen octahedron64. Analogously, here the change in microstructure across 20–25 cycles, namely, the emergence of highly oriented films, could allow confinement strain effects to dis-tort the oxygen tetrahedron more coherently along the polar axis. This synergistic effect could potentially explain the enhanced distortions observed in the ultrathin regime.Nanospectroscopy. PEEM was performed at the Advanced Light Source beamline 11.0.1. X-rays were incident at 30° off grazing, prob-ing just the first few nanometres of film, spanning the entire ten-cycle (1 nm) HZO thickness. Nanospectroscopy point-by-point scans were employed to spatially resolve XLD contrast; at each specified energy value in the oxygen K edge (520–550 eV) regime, PEEM images were taken for both values of the linear polarization (horizontal, vertical) across a 20-µm field of view (1,000 × 1,000 pixel grid). The exposure to high-flux synchrotron X-rays probably depolarized the ultrathin fer-roelectric sample as photoelectrons were removed from the surface, as is observed in ultrathin films of BaTiO3 and other ferroelectrics; PEEM-XLD images (Extended Data Fig. 9f) illustrate nanoscale do-mains at the energy range corresponding to the polar e-split feature. Data processing to extract XLD contrast involved dividing images of opposite linear polarization, which eliminates topography and work function contrast. Topography and work function artefacts contribute at the pre-edge (about 530 eV), whereas the intrinsic orbital anisotropy contributions manifest only at resonance (about 535 eV); the presence of XLD contrast only at resonance confirms the orbital asymmetry ori-gins of XLD contrast in ultrathin HZO. Furthermore, the highly textured nature of the ultrathin films prevents the XLD contrast from averaging to zero (cancellation would be expected for a fully polycrystalline film) on a length scale smaller than the",680

Nonlinear optical SHG was performed using a custom setup at University of California, Berkeley, as detailed in a previous work23. The excitation light was extracted using an optical parametric oscillator (Inspire HF 100, Spectra Physics, Santa Clara) pumped by a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator. The excitation laser was linearly polarized by a 900–1,300 nm polarizing beamsplitter. The transmitted p-polarized laser light can change its polarization by rotat-ing an infrared half waveplate before pumping the sample. The laser is focused by a 50× near-infrared objective onto the sample. The SHG signal was detected in the backscattering configuration, analysed by a visible-range polarizer, and finally collected by a cooled charge-coupled probes (25PtIr300B cantilever probe, Rocky Mountain Nanotechnol-ogy), grounded to the heavily doped Si substrate.Current–voltage hysteresis and tunnel electroresistance. We used voltage-polarity-dependent current–voltage hysteresis to rule out resis-tive switching mediated by dielectric breakdown and filamentary-type switching. For filamentary-mediated resistive switching—often ob-served in amorphous HfO2—the sense of hysteresis is dependent on the direction of the voltage sweep (that is, the initial polarity of the voltage waveform), which dictates the filament formation66. Mean-while, ferroelectric tunnel junctions demonstrate the same sense of current–voltage hysteresis independent of the sweep direction; this voltage-polarity independence is indicative of polarization-mediated switching, as observed for our ultrathin ten-cycle (1 nm) HZO films (Extended Data Fig. 10e). To further investigate the origin of the re-sistive switching, tunnelling electroresistance hysteresis maps as a function of write voltage (at low read voltage) demonstrate saturating, abrupt hysteretic behaviour (Extended Data Fig. 10b, d) characteristic of polarization-driven switching67,68. Evidence of polarization-driven resistive switching from tunnelling electroresistance is provided for ten-cycle (1 nm) HZO films of two different compositions (Extended Data Fig. 10).

Sayeef_Ava_FEFET_1e10_arXiv_2021.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Despite the fact that there has been much rekindled interest in ferroelectrics-based nonvolatile memories due to the discovery of CMOS-compatible doped HfO2 materials [1]–[8], one of the key roadblocks facing the development of FeFETs specifically is endurance. It has been shown, for thicker >5-6 nm FE oxides, that bulk charge-trapping and interfacial layer breakdown (due to the large coercive fields associated with ferroelectric HfO2, and therefore, the larger writeThis work was supported in part by the Berkeley Center for Negative Capacitance Transistors, the ASCENT Center, one of the six centers within the DARPA/SRC JUMP initiative and the DARPA FRANC program.

For thinner FE oxides <5nm in physical thickness, hot electron-induced hole damage and channel/oxide interface degradation tend to be the key agents limiting device endurance [15]. Proposals to extend the cycling lifetime of FeFETs include interfacial oxide engineering, gate workfunction engineering, modulating the material properties of the FE layer itself, and many others [16]–[21]. In this work, we combine a high-κ interfacial layer (IL) together with a thin FE film (∼4.5 nm). This is motivated by the previous observation by many authors (such as [5]) that the endurance cycling is mostly limited by IL breakdown. In fact, in a metal-FE-metal capacitor configuration, cycling endurance metrics exceeding 1010are routinely observed [2]. In a recent report, Abhishek et. al. circumvented the interfacial layer breakdown problem by fabricating a bottom-gate, channel last transistor, where an oxide semiconductor channel was grown directly on the FE material, thus achieving an endurance exceeding 1012cycles [22]. Similarly, Kim et. al. recently reported on the fabrication of vertical 3D NAND FE thin film transistors utilizing indium zinc oxide as the semiconductor channel, showing a cycling endurance of up to 108 [23]. Nonetheless, when crystalline Si is used as the channel material, as is required for high performance memory, formation of an IL is inevitable, and therefore endurance still remains a critical challenge to be addressed.In the context of IL breakdown, it is known that ‘time-to-breakdown’ has an exponential relationship to the applied electric field in the interfacial layer [24]. In other words, a mild decrease in the electric field could still lead to a substantial increase in the ‘time-to-breakdown’, and therefore could slow the generation of traps that eventually counteract the FE hysteresis. For the same charge density, a high-κ IL reduces the electric field by the ratio of its permittivity to that of SiO2. Our choice of high-κ IL is thermal nitridation of chemically formed silicon oxide. This provides a simple way to achieve an IL with a permittivity ∼ 8. Thermally grown silicon nitride also has a comparable breakdown field to SiO2 [25]. A thin 4.5 nm of FE HZO is chosen to suppress the effects of bulk charge trapping [15] and demonstrates the thickness scalability of FE HZO. We show that this combination substantially improves the device performance. In a DC sweep, almost a 1V memory window can be achieved with just ±2.5V. More importantly, with bipolar stress pulsing at ±3V, 250 ns, the endurance exceeds 1010cycles on silicon.3II.",938
Sayeef_Ava_FEFET_1e10_arXiv_2021.docx,EXPERIMENT,"AND EOT COMPARISONThe structure of the FeFET device characterized in this work is shown in Fig. 1(a), and TEMs to compare its gate stack incorporating a nitrided IL against that of a baseline device with an SiO2 IL (characterized in previous work [15]) are shown in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 1(b), respectively. The process flow to realize the FeFET is described in [11], with the IL formation step involving thermal nitridation of the SOI substrate at 850 °C in NH3 ambient rather than a self-terminated chemical growth of SiO2. As confirmed through TEM, the FE oxide thickness of both the control SiO2 FeFET and the FeFET with a nitrided IL are the same (roughly 4.5 nm after 45 cycles of deposition). The IL thicknesses of the SiO2 IL and nitrided IL are ∼8 ˚A and∼1.5 nm, respectively.Fig. 1(d) compares the CV of the baseline FeFET with a SiO2 IL to the CV of the FeFET with a nitrided IL. Though the physical thickness of the gate stack of the latter is larger, its capacitance is also larger. Using Synopsys TCAD, we have estimated the net EOT of the nitrided sample to be roughly 1 ˚A smaller than the baseline sample, based upon the accumulation capacitances.This allows us to make an estimate for the effective κ of the IL as follows:κ tNIL= 3.9 ×15 7.5 = 7.8κNIL SiO2 ×tbaseline − δEOTnetwhere κNIL and κSiO2 indicate the κ values of the nitrided IL and SiO2 IL respectively; tNIL and tbaseline indicate the physical thicknesses of the nitrided IL and SiO2 IL respectively; and δEOTnet is the simulated EOT difference between the two ILs. This calculation indicates the IL is nearly all Si3N4. Therefore, we expect to reduce the electric field in the IL layer by two times, which will ultimately result in a substantial increase in the time to breakdown.III.",503
Sayeef_Ava_FEFET_1e10_arXiv_2021.docx,results,"of a doubly swept IDVG curve. Nearly a 1V memory window can be achieved with just ±2.5V sweep. We note that, compared to published literature, this is quite a low voltage requirement. For example, our baseline devices as reported in [15] do not demonstrate any appreciable memory window at ±2.5V. Nonetheless it is also well known that the time to switch a given amount of polarization depends strongly on the applied voltage. Therefore, although the4DC sweep is a good way of visualizing the hysteresis, it is important to also probe the high-speed switching behavior. Fig. 2(b) and (c) show measured current at a read voltage of VG = ±0.25V as a function of pulse width. We define the high current/low VT state as the ERS state, and the low current/high VT state as the PGM state. Unsurprisingly, we observe a strong dependence of the current with the applied voltage. Below 1 µs, 2.5V is not good enough to provide the current level we see in the DC hysteresis. As the voltage amplitude increases, the current increases, signifying switching of a larger amount of polarization. At VG = 3V, the current approaches the level seen in DC hysteresis, even for a pulse width of ∼ 100 ns. Similarly, for the PGM state, VG = −3V brings the current level down to almost the level seen in the DC hysteresis at a pulse width of ∼ 250 ns. The asymmetry between PGM and ERS states is expected – accumulation of a thin SOI body requires a much larger voltage drop across the semiconductor, as discussed in previous reports [4]. Therefore, for a reasonably fast and symmetric operation, we choose a pulse width of 250 ns and a gate voltage of VG = ±3V for endurance cycling.In many studies, the endurance is quantified by measuring ±VT after a certain number of bipolar stress pulses. The ±VT determination requires one to perform sweeps over a small voltage range, which typically takes ∼ 1 second to complete. On the other hand, the importance of fast reading has recently been discussed (e.g. [22]). It is known from charge pumping",474
Sayeef_Ava_FEFET_1e10_arXiv_2021.docx,experiment,"s (as discussed in [15], [26]) that beyond several µs, charge trapping/de-trapping starts to manifest. These effects could in principle be quite complex, and could arise from the interplay between traps with varying time constants. Therefore, while slow sweeps to determine ±VT could provide important insights into trap assisted phenomena, they are also expected to artificially affect the actual currents that will be observed in a real application where the device is read quickly. Due to these considerations, we adopt fast reading of the device to determine its state. The complete endurance testing protocol is detailed in Fig. 3(a). During the stressing phase of the endurance test, bipolar voltage pulses of ±3V, 250 ns are applied at the gate of the FeFET, with a 250 ns delay between sequential pulses to achieve a stressing period of 1 µs total in duration. Periodically, a state determination test is conducted to evaluate the margin between the PGM and ERS states. For this, a 10 µs read pulse is applied at the gate of the FeFET (after either the ERS or PGM pulse), after ramping and stabilizing the drain voltage to 50 mV (see Fig. 3(a), right panel). The averaged current value during this 10 µs reading period is determined to be the read current. Figs. 3(b) and (c) show the readout current during the 10 µs reading period for the high VT (PGM) and low VT (ERS) states, respectively. In both cases, the current saturates well within5the READ duration of 10 µs.Fig. 4(a) shows the",348
Sayeef_Ava_FEFET_1e10_arXiv_2021.docx,results,"of endurance testing across different devices, proving that the devices with a nitrided IL can be reliably cycled to 1010. The data is plotted as IERS/IPGM vs. fatigue cycles for ease of comparison. The exact current levels are shown for a device in Fig. 4(b). First, we note that the high and low current levels are very similar to those measured from a DC sweep. This indicates that the device is switched properly with the PGM/ERS pulses. Interestingly, the device does not show any rapid degradation after 104− 106cycles, as reported in most studies. Rather, the high current level shows a slow degradation. The envelope of the low current similarly shows a slow degradation (increase); yet the separation of the current levels retains a margin of 103until 6×1010cycles. Beyond that point, a sudden breakdown is observed. Notably, this sudden breakdown is correlated with the gate leakage through the device shooting up several orders of magnitude, as shown in Fig. 4(c), indicating that the gate oxide itself breaks down close to 1011cycles. We note that, there are devices that does not experience such a breakdown. For example, Fig. 4(d) shows DC IDVG sweep from an exemplary device cycled to 1012. The anti-clockwise Hysteresis is still clearly visible. This should compared with previous studies where total reversal of handedness of Hysteresis happens after just 104-105cycles. This also shows that the Ferroelectric itself remains quite robust even after one trillion cycles. Finally, we present the retention behavior. As seen in Fig. 5, the retention looks unaffected for a testing duration of 104seconds for both the PGM and ERS states. The retention looks robust at both 25°C and 85°C. Thus despite relatively lower voltage operation and very large endurance, there is no discernible effect on the retention behavior.IV.",394

We have identified total oxide breakdown as the main limiting factor as opposed to defect (interface and bulk) induced clock-wise Hysteresis that has been reported by many previous studies.. Understanding charge injection during the endurance test and optimizing to reduce the total oxide breakdown could increase the endurance over 1012cycles, as our data shows that the FE film remains robust even beyond that cycling number.. Additional optimization of the IL and FE layers could allow for further reduction in the 6 operating voltage to below 2V, while maintaining and/or even enhancing the endurance behavior.. One potential drawback of using such a high-κ IL could be a reduction in mobility..

Furthermore, Kim et al. confirmed ferroelectricity for pure hafnium oxide for smaller grain sizes induced by a lower deposition temperature.36 Therefore, the grain size seems to play a crucial role in the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase in HZO.

Lett. 110, 182905 (2017)to the piezoelectric response found for yttrium doped HfO2 in a previous work.23With further cycling accompanied by a wake-up, the piezoelectric response is reduced. This is probably cor-related with the cycling induced phase transition which takes place during wake up as mentioned before. An increase in the piezoelectric coefficient around phase transition regions where different phases compete was also shown for perovskite based ferroelectrics.45,46Therefore, by controlling the initial phase and the phase transition during wake-up, the piezoelectric response can be further increased. The inset in Figure 2 shows a DBLI measurement with a unipolar signal, whereby a piezo-electric coefficient of 10pm/V can be extracted.Figure 3 shows the piezoelectric activity that can be probed on a nanoscale via PFM. The solid metal tips were initially chosen to ensure that the high displacement currents can be provided to achieve the desired sinusoidal excitation field required for the lock-in technique. However, the pads started peeling off when the bias sweep was performed, which might be due to the high absolute amplitude of the piezoresponse compared to a film with a thickness of just around 10 nm. To get an idea of the local manifestation of the piezoelectric properties, the measurements had to be per-formed on the bare oxide. As it was argued, for example, by Balke et al.,47,48artifacts can give rise to hysteretic loops, and it is hard to argue with PFM alone that the measure loops are dominated by the piezoelectric response itself. Capacitor measurements are preferable to achieve this goal. However, the remanent loop shown here is nicely saturated and fairly symmetric and exhibits a phase jump of exactly 180�. This is in line with the theory of a ferroelectric response but cannot be taken for granted on bare oxide as pointed out before.47,48 Figure 4 shows the",609

Ferroelectric doped HfO2 based capacitor structures are typically formed between two metal nitride or noble metal electrodes. Dopants in HfO2 can be selected from a wide range of dopants which are smaller (e.g. Si, Al, Ge) or larger (e.g. Y, Sr, La) than the Hf ion itself. In all cases, remanent polarization values of about 15 to 25 µC/cm2 with a coercive field of 1-2 MV/cm can be reached when the physical thickness of the layer is about 5-50 nm for most ALD, PVD, PLD, or CSD deposited layers2. For the PLD and CSD case, even higher thickness values up to 1 µm with good FE properties can be reached. Especially for higher doping concentrations of smaller dopants, like Si and Al or for Zr-rich Hf1-xZrxO2 films, an antiferroelectric (AFE)-like pinched hysteresis loop is observed. AFE-like behavior was attributed to a field induced transformation of a non-polar tetragonal to polar orthorhombic phase1,2,4. Within this",295

Typical capacitor diameter is 100-200 µm. The basic film structure is determined by SEM, and GIXRD analysis. The basic polarization hysteresis characterization is performed on an AixACCT TF Analyzer 3000. Since typical field cycling is performed in the kHz regime, a time resolved synchrotron based micro-spot XRD analysis is chosen to characterize possible field induced phase changes in the ferroelectric layer at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble. The few 100 nm wide rectangular X-ray beam (λ = 0.018816 nm), concentrated through a 2-dimensional lens, enabled to characterize single contact pads during electric field cycling. The electrical field was applied using a function generator (Rohde & Schwarz HMF2550) triggered by the beamline software.

Synchrotron based micro-spot XRD measurements are chosen to determine the macroscopic phase change in an AFE-like sample when an external field is applied similar to a polarization hysteresis measurement. The clearly pinched hysteresis loop of a 5.6 cation % Si doped HfO2 film is shown in Fig. 2b. Micro-spot XRD on a 200 µm sized metal/ ferroelectric/metal capacitor stack revealed no significant change in the macroscopic XRD pattern indicating no large scale phase change when a positive or negative field of 3 MV/cm² is applied to the structure (Fig. 1a). Independent of the applied field, a polycrystalline structure with orthorhombic, tetragonal and minor monoclinic phase portions is present. Similar measurements with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) on a pure AFE-like ZrO2 sample indicated a predominately tetragonal phase structure which showed small structural changes on the microscopic scale when an external field of 4 MV/cm² is applied3. Overall, the structure seems to be stable when a field is applied, but minor changes in the local phase are possible. Similar trends were detected for the field cycling case. Field cycling has been postulated to lead to structural changes in ferroelectric HfO2 which correspond to the macroscopically measured hysteresis characteristics5. Here, a Hf0.3Zr0.7O2 sample with strong wake-up effects during field cycling is chosen for micro-spot XRD characterization. Again, no change in the XRD pattern can be detected before and after field cycling (Fig. 1b). For a similar Gd doped HfO2 sample with strong wake-up during field cycling, Hoffmann et al. reported also no phase change during field cycling in micro-spot XRD4, but TEM again revealed structural changes on the microscopic scale5. Phase transformations of non-polar doped HfO2 regions to the polar orthorhombic phase were reported. Accordingly,",571

Calculations of the depolarization field caused by the finite screening length within TiN electrodes or by dead layer effects due to non-switching interface layers in between the ferroelectric layer and the metal electrode indicate a depolarization field >1 MV/cm² for 10 nm thick doped HfO2 films6. Non-polar phase regions in a ferroelectric doped HfO2 layer have been confirmed by TEM measurements5. Based on this depolarization field value, the impact on the hysteresis loop can be calculated.

The finite screening length/dead layer model can also be applied to explain a depinching of the hysteresis loop during field cycling. So far in literature, a combination of domain depinning10 and a charge movement based phase transition5,10 is discussed to explain a clear change in the hysteresis loop during field cycling. But, as discussed before, the initially pinched hysteresis loop could arise due to depolarization fields. A reduction of the depolarization field during field cycling could occur due to interfacial trapped screening charges which may not lead to any macroscopically observable structural changes and is in general agreement with the previously mentioned structural measurements.

Beyer_Trentzsch_GF_FEFET_22nm_IEDM_2017.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Ferroelectric HfO2 [1] enables a scalable and CMOS compatible embedded non-volatile memory (eNVM), keeping pace with the scaling demands of leading-edge logic technologies (Fig. 1). We have developed an innovative and non-invasive eNVM process [2] applicable for HKMG technologies. The corresponding memory module is directly transferable into our 22nm planar FDSOI platform [3] where it proves scalability down to the 12nm technology node, while keeping the manufacturing costs very low since only two additional masks are required. Back-bias as a unique fully-depleted SOI (FDSOI) feature offers further opportunities for the FeFET operation and application.

Beyer_Trentzsch_GF_FEFET_22nm_IEDM_2017.docx,DISCUSSION,"A. 22nm and 12nm FDSOI platform Switching the polarization of the FeFET by applying a positive (program) or negative (erase) gate voltage pulse induces a stable but reversible threshold voltage shift depending on the orientation of the dipoles (low-VT and high-VT, respectively). These two distinguishable states of the device (Fig. 2), separated by the so-called memory window (MW), can be sensed with a short readout of the transistor's drain current. A ferroelectric HfO2-based FeFET has been integrated into a 22nm FDSOI CMOS platform. Physical gate lengths are 24 nm and 20 nm which are required for 22nm and 12nm generations, respectively. Fig. 3 shows TEM cross sections of the FeFET implemented into the FDSOI process. Beside the memory device, cross sections of the logic devices are shown to illustrate the successful patterning of this SoC embedded technology. The 22nm baseline performance remains unchanged (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows the ID-VG transfer characteristics of a WxL=80x20 nm FDSOI FeFET after applying positive and negative voltage pulses of 3.8 V for 10 µs. A clear counter-clockwise VT shift indicates ferroelectric switching in this highly scaled device (cell size is 0.025 µm²) and therewith proves the feasibility of a fully depleted FeFET technology as well as its scalability to the 22nm and 12nm FDSOI nodes. Besides the remarkably large memory window of up to 1.5 V, exceeding the state of the art 28SLP technology [2], the back-bias option available in FDSOI technologies offers further VT optimization (Fig. 6). Advanced trimming and targeting possibilities for this new memory concept during read can be used (Fig. 7). The coupling factor |dVT/dVB| of 75 mV/V of the back-biased FeFET is comparable to a standard logic device [3] and can be used for both positive and negative voltages. Pulse duration and pulse amplitude can be traded depending on the aimed application field. For example, a low-voltage programming scheme with longer pulse durations can be used for non-speed critical but high density circuits. On the other hand ultra-fast high-performance tasks can be realized with rapid and high voltage pulses. Program/erase pulse times in the nanosecond range furthermore minimize the parasitic charge trapping, avoiding the artificial lowering of memory window [4] and enable immediate readout after write. According to TCAD simulations a strong confinement of the electrical field in the interfacial/ferroelectric layer is expected from this fully depleted technology (Fig. 8). For ferroelectric switching a high field in the ferroelectric layer at low gate voltage is highly beneficial, since it reduces electrical field stress with improved endurance and enables denser low-voltage periphery circuits. Endurance cycling (using +/−3.5 V, 10 µs) of the most aggressively scaled 20 nm devices shows a residual memory window of 0.4 V after cycling to 2x104 (Fig. 9). The result is comparable to previous data [2,4,5] obtained for the 28SLP platform and further optimization is expected from interface treatments [6]. B.32 MBit Test Vehicle In order to analyze and optimize performance and yield of the FeFET cells a flexible 28SLP test chip is designed, which can be adapted to changes in the FeFET integration process. The chip comes with a competitive target cell size of 0.036 µm² and a memory size of 32 MBit per cell type. As shown in Fig. 10, the chip layout is composed of twelve instances of memory macros with different cell geometries. The internal control logic and the parallel 32 Bit bus allows a fast and robust read/write performance. A JTAG interface gives access to various timing, voltage and configuration settings. Three different types of sense amplifiers are implemented depending on speed and accuracy requirements. In addition each cell in the memory array can be directly accessed (direct memory access, DMA) in order to record transfer functions and verify program/erase operations. C.32 MBit Array Performance This basic device functionality was tested utilizing a 30 µs pulse 2 MBit sector erase and a 20 ns 2 kBit word program, including the 10 ns 4.2 V actual program pulse. The readout was done using a 50 ns drain-current sensing. Fig. 11 shows the sense amplifier readout of a complex and non-monotonic pattern written into the 0.036 µm2 cell 32 MBit array. The analog drain current readouts via DMA are illustrated in Fig. 12. From the comparison with the sense amplifier",1029
Beyer_Trentzsch_GF_FEFET_22nm_IEDM_2017.docx,results,"from Fig. 11, it can be concluded that the peripheral logic works within the expected noise margin. The remaining bit error rate is affected mainly by defects as indicated in the wafer map in Fig. 13 rather than by ferroelectric instabilities of the memory cell itself. The threshold voltage distribution of WxL=240x34 nm and WxL=500x500 nm single cells, measured with voltage sweeps in the millisecond range, is shown in Fig. 14. In contrast to on-chip-clock-controlled array operation, charge trapping cannot be suppressed in these measurements by using ultra short pulses. In general device geometries are not the smallest cell size possible on 28nm but were chosen to enable most robust memory operation, using up to 5 V program and erase voltage pulses. Data from three wafers with a die checkerboard measurement were used. A clear separation is visible for the larger FeFET dimension, whereas the smaller cell is currently still affected by charge trapping and needs further process optimizations. Tab. I summarizes the memory window and its variation for various device lengths and widths. D.Data Retention Retention reliability was studied by monitoring the stability of the two stored states as a function of bake time. Initially, a 64 kBit WxL=500x500 nm cell array was programmed in stripe pattern, so that half of the bits were in the low-VT and the other half in the high-VT states. Transfer characteristics (ID-VG) of all the devices were measured and a subsequent bake at different temperatures was performed. Fig. 15 shows the time evolution of the two states after a cumulative bake at 250 °C up to 7 days. The high-VT state was taken as a reference. Only a decay of the low-VT state is visible. It can be observed that the major margin loss occurs within the first few minutes. Afterwards the separation of the states remains almost stable. Fig. 16 shows the transfer curve of the two states at room temperature and after a bake at 300 °C for 1 hour. Each readout corresponds to the mean value of a 32 kBit collected data points relative to one state whereas the error bars indicate the standard deviation stretch. Two main effects are visible: shift of both curves towards lower VG values and a closure of the memory window. The shift of both, the low-VT as well as the high-VT state could be readily explained by electron-trapping from energetic deep states that were populated during program/erase cycling. Nevertheless, this test still proves the stability of the two states at severe temperature stress. III.SUMMARYOur low-cost and ultra-low power FeFET based bulk HKMG technology eNVM module has been transferred into a 22nm fully depleted SOI technology keeping all unique features of FDSOI fully functional. The scalability from 28nm to sub-22nm is proven using just two additional masks over the 22FDSOI baseline. It is also shown that the electrical properties like memory window benefit from the improved electrostatics of the FDSOI technology. In addition, the unique feature of back-bias can be used in order to further tune the FeFET properties. Programming of complex patterns into a 32 MBit array with nanosecond range program/erase times, data retention up to 300 °C for 1 h and endurance up to at least 2x104 cycles has been successfully shown.",720

However, due to the fail-safe and fault turn-on issues of high power switching devices, the normally-off GaN HEMTs with high Vth are needed. However, several techniques such as the gate recess result in the degradation in ID,max and thus, the Vth of the E-mode GaN HEMTs are not high enough to avoid fault turn-on [1, 2]. In this work, a new concept to solve the problem, by the combination of ferroelectric and charge trapped layers [3]is correspond to the published data as shown in Fig. 7. The comparison of the device with different blocking oxide is shown in Fig. 8. A higher Vth was observed for the device with HfZrO2 blocking oxide, indicating a higher density of electrons was stored in the charge trapping layer (CTL).

The schematic cross section of the device is shown in Fig. 2. The gate-to-drain spacing LGD, gate-to-source spacing LGS, and gate length LG were 15-μm, 3-μm, and 2-μm, respectively.",508
Edward_GaN_Ferroelectric_VLSI_2017.docx,Discussion,"Fig. 3 illustrates the mechanism of obtaining high Vth. After the fabrication (Fig. 3(a)), high voltage (16 V) is applied to the gate electrode as the initialization process (Fig. 3(b)). The initialization less than 1 ms, causes strong polarization in HfZrO2 film and electron trapping in HfO2 layer. After the initialization, the gate voltage (Vg) can be changed to any used voltage, but certain amount of polarization remains because of ferroelectricity of HfZrO2, and trapped electrons remain in the HfO2 layer (Fig. 3(c)). In the case of non-ferroelectric blocked layer (HfO2), electrons are trapped into the trap layer (HfO2), but the amount of the trapped electron is smaller because the non-polarization (Fig. 3(d) and (e)). The larger electron concentration in the trapped layer and remaining polarization in the blocked layer make Vth higher in HfZrO2 case. Fig. 4 shows the HRTEM image of the gate dielectric stack. The polycrystalline nature of the HfZrO2 film was confirmed by the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) image (Fig. 4(b)). Fig. 5 shows the GIXRD spectrum of HfZrO2 film deposited on vs. time with gate stress. A ΔVth ~500 mV with VDS = 0 V and a ΔVth ~300 mV with VDS = 10 V were observed after 10,000s stress. The device with HfO2 is burned out earlier in first condition. It might be due to the severe trap assisted tunneling current through the gate. As shown in Fig. 14, the dynamic RON increased to 1.66 times at the quiescent bias of 500 V. The low current collapse of the device is contributed to the effective passivation with high quality Si3N4/AlGaN interface using nitrogen passivation prior to Si3N4 deposition. Figs. 15 and 16 show the Vth and ID,max with various recess depth for the device with HfZrO2. The recess of AlGaN layer as shown in Fig. 2, is an effective method to increase Vth.

Al nanoclusters increase the remnant polarization (Pr) and reduce the voltage necessary for polarization switching. Furthermore, the program and erase endurance at the cycle of more than 250k and the Pr retention at 85ºC for 10 years are achieved. Al nanoclusters are formed by the partial oxidation of sub-monolayer metallic Al embedded in HZO films. Al nanoclusters enhance the large grain growth of orthorhombic-phase HZO during FE-HZO crystallization annealing. The reduction of grain boundaries caused by the large grain growth with Al nanoclusters effectively reduces the leakage current in the HZO film. As a result, reliability of the FE HZO film is significantly improved. nanoclusters, and Al nanoclusters enhance the coalescence of FE HZO grains and enlarge the grain size.

Figure 2 shows the dose rate of Al using the doping Recently, ferroelectric (FE) orthorhombic-phase HfO2 film is one of the most attractive materials for future emerging memory because of high compatibility of CMOS integration together with high versatility as high-k gate dielectrics for CMOS devices. A lot of additives to enhance the ferroelectricity, such as Si, Y, Zr, Al, N, etc., have been examined [1-3]. In particular, Zr has advantages of large composition range showing ferroelectric behavior and the high remnant polarization (Pr) [3]. Furthermore, it has been reported that the Hf and Zr composition ratio of 50% shows high Pr [4]. The Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) film is one of promising candidates for the application to memory devices. On the other hand, although there were few papers on reliability of HZO films, the degradation of endurance and retention characteristics due to the depolarization was revealed [5, 6]. From the viewpoint of materials engineering, the orthorhombic phase formation and the grain size control in FE HZO films are key issues to improve the reliability. Indeed, the grain size engineering in thick HZO films by the laminated HZO structure using the insertion of the Al2O3 interlayer has been reported [7, 8]. However, the distinct fatigue was observed due to the formation of additional charge trap sites at the Al2O3/HZO interface [8]. Further novel and attractive methods to improve reliability of HZO films are strongly required for highly reliable FE memory. In this paper, we demonstrate highly reliable HZO films with partially oxidized Al nanoclusters embedded by sub-monolayer metallic Al doping instead of inserting a layer. Precise control of Al doping ensures the stable formation of Al system designed for a low dose. The quite low dose rate of 2.4 ×1012 cm-2/sec can precisely control Al dose. Then, 5-nm-thick HZO film was deposited again. After 10-nm-thick TiN film was formed as a capping layer, rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 600ºC for 60s was carried out to form the FE crystal phase. After 100-nm-thick poly-crystalline silicon was deposited, P implantation at the dose of 5×1015 cm-2 with 10 keV and activation annealing were conducted. The high resolution TEM image of the HZO film after FE-HZO crystallization annealing is shown in Fig. 3. Al nanoclusters in the middle of the film are confirmed. P-V measurement characterized Pr and coercive voltage (Vc). C-V and I-V were also measured. P/E endurance and retention characteristics were evaluated as the reliability of HZO films. The condition of the endurance cycle test was fixed at ±2V with the frequency of 10kHz. For physical analyses, the distribution of grain size and crystal direction in HZO films with Al nanoclusters were characterized by scanning precession electron diffraction. The profile of Al and the binding energy of Al nanoclusters in HZO films were also measured by STEM-EDS system and XPS, respectively. III.",722

At the Al dose of 5×1013 cm-2, Pr shows maximum, then Pr drastically decreases with increasing Al dose. On the other hand, Vc monotonically decreases with increasing Al dose, which indicates lowering the voltage necessary for polarization switching. Figure 7 shows C-V characteristics of the HZO film with and without Al nanoclusters. Maximum capacitance (Cmax) with Al nanoclusters is higher than that without one, and the voltage of Cmax with Al nanoclusters is lower than that without one. Cmax as a function of Al dose is shown in Fig. 8. Cmax increases with increasing Al dose and the peak of Cmax is shown at 5×1013 cm-2. Resulting from the enhancement of Pr (or Cmax) and the reduction of Vc, precise optimization of Al doping was found to be required. The Al dose of 5×1013 cm-2 was chosen in the following reliability study. Figure 9 shows P/E endurance of the HZO film with and without Al nanoclusters.

Furthermore, the retention characteristic of the HZO film with Al nanoclusters at the room temperature (RT) is superior to that without one, as shown in Fig. 10. Al nanoclusters can ensure the extrapolated Pr window ����������2 after 10 years. Moreover, retention characteristics after the P/E cycle of 10k and 200k indicate not only the window margin but also no change in the decay rate between 10k and 200k cycles, as shown in Fig. 11. The HZO film with Al nanoclusters also exhibits the retention characteristic at elevated temperature (85ºC), as shown in Fig. 12. The extrapolated Pr window can be confirmed after 10 years, which should be contrasted to the reported value of 100s at 85ºC for the single HZO film [5]. To understand the cause for the improvement of reliability in HZO films with Al nanoclusters, I-V characteristics are compared, as shown in Fig. 13. The leakage current in the HZO film with Al nanoclusters decreases with increasing Al dose.It has been well-known that fatigue effect during cycle test is due to defects in FE films and injected charges that pin the domain walls while retention loss",659

The injection of charges into HZO films with Al nanoclusters is strictly suppressed and reliability is improved. B.Physical properties of HZO films with Al nanoclusters To clarify the physical properties of the HZO film with Al nanoclusters, crystal grain maps and mean grain size as a function of Al dose are shown in Fig. 14 and 15, respectively. The mean grain size increases with increasing Al dose. This result is consistent with the reduction of the leakage current since grain boundaries as leakage passes decrease due to the increase of grain size. Figure 16 shows crystal direction maps of orthorhombic phase grains in HZO films with and without Al nanoclusters. Here, the grains of tetragonal phase are indicated by black areas. The crystal direction of orthorhombic grains with Al nanoclusters tends to align with [001] direction, as shown in Fig. 17. This result suggests Pr increase and Vc decrease (see Figs. 5 and 6). To understand the feature of Al nanoclusters after the FE-HZO crystallization annealing, STEM-EDS maps and the line profile are shown in Fig. 18. Most of Al are located at the middle of the HZO film despite 600ºC annealing. Moreover, the detail analysis of Al nanoclusters was carried out with XPS. Figure 19 shows XPS spectra of Al 2p and 2s before and after FE-HZO crystallization annealing. Sub-monolayer Al was partially oxidized after top HZO deposition, and oxidation of Al might proceed during FE-HZO crystallization annealing. Metallic Al-Al bonds, however, remain. It is considered that nuclei of metallic Al are located at the center of Al nanoclusters. Although further study of Al nanoclusters is needed, creation of Al nanoclusters is a key to realize highly reliable FE films. C.Role of Al nanoclusters in HZO films To explain the cause for the improvement of reliability in the HZO film with embedded Al nanoclusters, feasible models are considered. Figure 20 shows schematic illustrations about the role of Al nanoclusters in HZO films. In the case of the HZO film without Al nanoclusters, during FE-HZO crystallization, poly-crystalline HZO grains grow on both TiN electrodes and contact each other, then grain boundaries are created. These grain boundaries increase leakage current, and charges are injected during cycle test. On the other hand, in the case of the HZO film with Al nanoclusters, Al are embedded in amorphous HZO films. During FE-HZO crystallization, clustering of Al proceeds. then, Al nanoclusters are surrounded by poly-crystalline FE HZO grains because of the grain growth. It is considered that micro-strain is generated at the interface between poly-crystalline HZO grains with Al nanoclusters due to the difference of the thermal expansion coefficient between Al nanocluster and HZO. The coalescence of FE HZO grains is enhanced to relax the strain energy. This coalescence causes the large HZO grain growth with a preferred [001] crystal direction. As a result, grain boundaries decrease. In addition, several of Al nanoclusters are localized at the grain boundary. These Al nanoclusters might interrupt leakage current. IV.",750

We establish the thickness-temperature mapping indicating a clear tradeoff between the thickness scaling and crystallization temperature, which has to be taken into account in the implementation as back-end-of-line (BEOL) FeRAM. Utilizing the thickness scaling and high-field wake-up without reliability loss, we demonstrate 4-nm-thick HZO having low crystallization temperature (500ºC), excellent ferroelectricity (2Pr>25 C/cm2), low operating voltage (0.7-1.2V), and high read/write endurance (projected to 1014).",183
Takagi_0.7V_HZO_VLSI_2021.docx,Introduction,"HfO2-based ferroelectric thin films [1-2] have triggered a great interest in ferroelectric memory toward VLSI integration owing to their high CMOS compatibility and scalability. In particular, low crystallization temperature around 400ºC of HZO [3-4] enables the application to BEOL memory integration, where the process temperature needs to be as low as possible, at least below 500ºC [5-6]. On the other hand, their large coercive field EC (> 1 MV/cm) and typical thickness of 10 nm lead to high operating voltage (> 2 V) that becomes challenging for the implementation in advanced technology nodes. One promising approach to reduce the operating voltage is to scale down the film thickness for reducing the coercive voltage needed for polarization reversal. However, a lack of systematic studies on how the thickness scaling impacts on the optimal process, the ferroelectric properties, and the memory-device reliability (Fig. 1) makes it difficult to understand the real potential of thin-film HZO toward BEOL FeRAM. In this study, we systematically investigate the tendency of required annealing temperature in thin HZO, examine the possibility of low-voltage operation (≤ 1.2 V), and demonstrate the significant improvement of read/write endurance with thickness scaling. Device preparationFig. 2(a) shows the process flow of TiN/HZO/TiN MFM capacitors employed in this study. HZO layers with a wide range of thicknesses of 2.8-9.5 nm were prepared by ALD (TEMAH, TEMAZ, and H2O) before being crystallized by rapid thermal annealing in a temperature range of 300-600ºC for 30 s after top TiN deposition. TEM images of 4.0 nm/500ºC and 4.6 nm/450ºC HZO in Fig. 2(b)-(c) show that HZO is well crystallized after annealing. Strong-field wake-up effect In thick HZO, clear ferroelec-tric hysteresis loops can be observed with only small wake-up effect. On the other hand, HZO films thinner than 5 nm show AFE-like double hysteresis loops for the pristine state, agreeing with [7], and exhibit clear ferroelectricity with 2Pr> 25 C/cm2 after 106 wake-up cycling (Fig. 3). After strong-field (4 MV/cm) cycling, the ferroelectricity is activated and thin HZO films exhibit clear hysteresis loops even at operating field much lower than the cycling field (<< 4 MV/cm), while the low-field cycling is insufficient to obtain hysteresis loops with wide memory window (Fig. 4). Thickness-temperature mapping The P-E characteristics of HZO with various thicknesses and annealing temperatures (Fig. 5) illustrate that higher annealing temperature is required for effectively crystallizing the ferroelectric phase in thin HZO: 400ºC, 450ºC, and 500ºC for 9.5-nm, 4.6-nm, and 4.0-nm HZO, respectively. The annealing temperatures and the HZO thicknesses that provide 2Pr>10C/cm2 are summarized and mapped in Fig. 6, indicating that there is a clear tradeoff between the thickness scaling and ferroelectric-phase crystallization temperature. Fig. 7 shows a schematic diagram to describe this thickness-temperature tradeoff: more thermal budget is required to crystallize thinner films. The similar diagram has been introduced in [8] to describe doped HfO2 with thickness larger than 10 nm, implying that this diagram is applicable to other HfO2-based ferroelectrics in a wide thickness range. After phase stabilization by annealing, field cycling can boost the transition to the ferroelectric phase, which has been reported to be reservable [9]. The following examinations focus on MFM capacitors near the boundary of this thickness-temperature mapping (lowest annealing temperature at a given thickness), 500ºC for 4.0-nm, 450ºC for 4.6- and 5.6-nm, and 400ºC for thick HZO, since lower thermal budget is preferable for the BEOL implementation. Low-voltage operationFig. 8 shows the switching polarization Psw (= 2Pr for saturation loops) of HZO with various thicknesses for given read/write voltages. At high operating voltage, thicker HZO films are preferred owing to their better ferroelectric phase stability. On the other hand, at low operating voltage, thinner HZO films are favorable to achieve sufficient field against EC for polarization reversal. While thick HZO cannot perform well at applied voltage below 1.2 V, 4.0-nm and 4.6-nm HZO films exhibit excellent ferroelectric hysteresis loops down to 0.7 V and 1.0 V, respectively (Fig. 9), suggesting the potential of thin HZO in advanced technology nodes. This also",1114

At 1.2 V and 1.0 V read/write operations, much superior same-state (SS) data retention can be found in thin HZO because of higher read/write field. The opposite-state (OS) test, which reflects the imprint behavior, shows comparable tendency to reported literatures [9-10], indicating that the imprint issue still exists in scaled HZO. J-E measurements were Endurance improvement conducted to investigate the breakdown characteristics (Fig. 11). The electrical breakdown of HZO occurs at larger electric field in thinner HZO: EBD is 3.5 MV/cm in 9.5-nm HZO and reaches 6 MV/cm in 4.0-nm HZO (Fig. 12(a)). This is attributable to lower applied voltage that decreases the energy of electrons flowing through and the damages to the HZO layer, which is similar to the well-known phenomenon in the SiO2/Si MOS system having improved breakdown tolerance with thinning oxide [11-12].

The fatigue-limited endurance is also extrapolated to over 1014 thanks to high write field even at 1.2 V.

Park_CSHwang_HZO_IrO2_TiN_PSS_2014.docx,Introduction,"The ferroelectric/electrode interface is one of the most important factors that affect the ferroelec-tric properties and endurance of ferroelectric devices [1]. Conventional materials, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT), suf-fered from the insufficient switching endurance for work-ing memory application with the Pt electrode [2]. The origin of the degradation during electric-field cycling is generally thought to be related to the accumulation and possible ordering of oxygen vacancies in the region near the noble-metal electrodes, such as Pt [3, 4]. Therefore, adopting the oxide electrode, such as IrO2, is a promising method of enhancing the ferroelectric properties and the endurance of ferroelectric capacitors up to the 1014 cycles level [2–5]. The oxide electrode can work as an oxygen vacancy sink, allowing the endurance of ferroelectric ca-pacitors to be improved significantly [3, 4].For the case of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO), which is one of the hottest materials in this field due to its excellent ferroelectricity with small film thickness (tf), Si-process compatibility, and matured deposition techniques, in contrast, the effect of the elec-trode on the ferroelectric properties and endurance has been rarely reported since the first report by Müller et al. [6]. Park et al. reported that the remnant polarization (Pr) of TiN/HZO/TiN capacitors was ~30% larger than that of the Pt/HZO/TiN capacitor, which means that the TiN/HZO interface was beneficial in achieving better ferroelectric performance compared with the Pt/HZO interface [7]. The reason for such an aspect of the TiN electrode, however, has not been clearly elucidated. Meanwhile, TiN is a reac-tive metal that could be relatively easily oxidized into TiOxNy or TiO2, which is not expected to be appropriate for achieving the optimum properties [8]. Changing the bot-tom electrode (BE), however, is a very challenging task given the fact that the HZO film showed the best ferroelec-tric properties when they were grown on TiN BE [9]. It was also noted that the formation energy of the oxide elec-trode, such as RuO2, is relatively smaller than that of TiO2 [10, 11]. This means that the severe loss of oxygen from RuO2 could be induced when it is adopted as the top elec-trode (TE) in TiN BE through the thin HZO layer. This in-dicates that adopting RuO2 as the TE material may not re-sult in the optimum endurance performance. Therefore, it is an important task to examine the interactions of oxide TE and TiN BE with the ferroelectric HZO thin films whose tf are only ~10 nm. In addition, the coercive field of HfO2-based thin films is larger than that of thin PZT films © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim RapidPhys. Status Solidi RRL 8, No. 6 (2014) Research Letter 533 by about one order of magnitude [7]. Such a large electric field is known to change the resistance state of oxide films through the motion of the defects, such as the oxygen va-cancy, which can also make a difference in terms of endur-ance compared to PZT [12]. In this study, the ferroelectric properties and the endurance of the TiN/HZO/TiN and RuO2/HZO/TiN capacitors were compared, and their dif-ferences were explained via structural and chemical analy-sis, which have not yet been reported in detail. 2",844

As the growth per cycles of HfO2 and ZrO2 were almost identical (~0.12 nm/cycle), the HZO films with a Hf:Zr ratio of 0.5:0.5 could be deposited using a HfO2:ZrO2 ALD cycle ratio of 1:1. For the electrical characterization, Pt(60 nm)/TiN(20 nm) and Pt(60 nm)/ RuO2(20 nm) TEs were deposited via DC (reactive for RuO2 and TiN) sputtering through a shadow mask with a 300 μm hole diameter (TiN and RuO2 contacts HZO films). The TiN TE samples were annealed at 500 °C for 30 s in a N2 atmosphere after TE deposition (TiN/PMA). The details of the optimized RuO2 deposition condition were reported elsewhere [13]. For the RuO2 TE samples, on the other hand, the following three annealing conditions were adopted: (1) postmetallization-annealing (RuO/PMA) – annealing at 500 °C for 30 s in a N2 atmosphere after TE deposition; (2) postdeposition-annealing (RuO/PDA) – annealing at 500 °C for 30 s in a N2 atmosphere before TE deposition; and (3) PDA + curing (RuO/curing) – anneal-ing the PDA samples at 400 °C for 30 min in an air atmo-sphere after TE deposition. The cation composition and tf were examined via X-ray fluorescence (Quant’X, Thermo Scientific) and ellipsometry (L-116d, Gaetner), respec-tively. For the structural analysis, Pt(10 nm)/TiN(20 nm) and Pt(10 nm)/RuO2(20 nm) layers were deposited on HZO films with no patterning. The crystallographic phase of the films was examined through a normal θ–2θ scan and via grazing-angle incidence X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) using an X-ray diffractometer (Pananalytical X-pert Pro, Cu Kαradiation with a 0.15418 nm X-ray wavelength). Depth profiling was performed via Auger electron spec-troscopy (AES, Perkin–Elmer, 660). For electrical charac-terization, the polarization electric field (P–E) and capaci-tance–field (C–E) were measured at room temperature using a ferroelectric tester (TF Analyzer 2000, Aixacct Systems) with a 1 kHz frequency and an impedance ana-lyzer (4194A, HP) with a 10 kHz AC frequency. An en-durance test was performed using a ferroelectric tester (TF Analyzer 2000, Aixacct Systems) with a 100 kHz electrical cycling frequency. 3",726

This means that the RuO2 TE degraded the ferro-electric properties of the HZO capacitor, which is quite dif-ferent from the reports on the PZT capacitors [4, 5]. To elucidate this unexpected result, the crystal structure of RuO/PMA was analysed using GAXRD spectra, as can be seen in Fig. 1b.

In fact, the process of TE sputtering is well known as a source of inter-facial defects [13]..

The physical and ferroelectric properties of the samples were reported elsewhere [18]. With an electric field for cycling of 3 MV/cm, the initial Pr of the sample annealed at 500 °C was the largest, whereas that of the sample annealed at 400 °C was the smallest. It is believed that Tanneal affects the crystalline quality of the ferroelectric film, and that Tanneal of 400 °C is too low to produce a high-quality film with a low density of defects. In addition, the interface between the ferroelectric film and the electrode could also be affected by Tanneal. Meanwhile, an increase in Tanneal can result in the formation of the partial monoclinic phase (m-phase), which can also affect the ferroelectric properties and endurance. Especially, a double-layered structure with an upper m-phase and a lower ferroelectric orthorhombic phase can be formed partly with the increasing Tanneal or tf of the HZO films [18]. The effect of the m-phase formation can be ob-served more clearly in Fig. 4b. TiN/PMA, whose tf is 17 nm, contains more m-phase than the thinner films do, which is consistent with the previous report [11]. The m-phase can work as a dead layer in ferroelectrics and would thus de-grade both the ferroelectric properties [18] and the endur-ance of the HZO capacitors. For the endurance, the problem can be even worse because the loss of the switching electric field across the m-phase with a low εr must be more severe, and an even higher voltage is necessary to induce sufficient electrical switching. The concentred electric field across the low-εr region can more easily result in a hard breakdown. As seen in Fig. 4b, the TiN/PMA sample, whose tf was 17 nm, was broken down at an electric cycling of only 106 times, whereas the samples whose tf values were 10 nm and 5.5 nm showed robust ferroelectric characteristics up to ~108 and ~109 cycles, respectively. Even though the 5.5 nm thick TiN/PMA could switch to a cycle number more than 10 nm thick one, its Pr was much smaller than that of the 10 nm thick one. This might have been due to the increase of the portion of nonferroelectric tetragonal phase or the increase of the low-εr interfacial layer. Therefore, the ~10 nm of tf was found to be the best for the optimum ferroelectric prop-erties and endurance. 4",714
Park_CSHwang_HZO_IrO2_TiN_PSS_2014.docx,conclusion,", unlike the conventional ferroelectrics, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 with a noble-metal BE, the RuO2 electrode could not improve the ferroelectric www.pss-rapid.comproperties and endurance of the HZO capacitors with the TiN BE. The reason for this was the reduction of the RuO2 TE by the chemical reaction with the reactive TiN BE. However, this does not mean that an oxide electrode cannot work with HZO film, and it is still expected to improve the endurance HZO capacitors, if there is no fab-rication issue. TiN appears to be the best and only BE material that is known to work well with ferroelectric HfO2-based films, and as such, it seems unlikely that TiN BE will be replaced with another electrode material. Mean-while, the TiN electrode contained a significant amount of oxygen atoms, which may decrease the oxygen vacancy concentration in the HZO layer during the repeated switch-ing, which in turn can improve the endurance of the ferro-electric capacitors. The TiN/PMA sample showed robust ferroelectric properties even after electric cycling for 109 times with a switching field of 2.5 MV/cm. The effect of Tanneal and tf were also examined. With a 3 MV/cm electric field for cycling, the 500 °C Tanneal showed the best endur-ance, which can be ascribed to the minimized m-phase formation and the improved crystalline quality of the HZO film.",333

Published-JAP.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Perovskite ferroelectrics offer large dielectric, piezo-electric, and pyroelectric response, which can be simultane-ously leveraged to create multifunctional devices and enable miniaturization in various applications.1Among such devi-ces are concepts for autonomous, millimeter-scale robotics where the ferroelectric components fulfill multiple tasks; these include environmental energy harvesting, logic ele-ments, acoustic and optical sensors and transducers, and pre-cision positioners and locomotion units, all performed by the ferroelectric material.2Such units are of particular interest for performing duties in hostile environments that are either difficult to reach or otherwise dangerous for humans. Space is a quintessential example of one such environment, along with facilities that use or process radioisotopes. Thus, it is necessary to characterize the multifunctional properties of ferroelectric oxides as a function of radiation exposure, in order to evaluate device performance and functionality in harsh environments.Prior work studying radiation effects on ferroelectric materials has primarily concentrated on applications in mem-ory devices and capacitors, showing radiation-induced degra-dation of dielectric and polarization responses in ferroelectricthin films.3–9While degradation of functional properties due to high doses of X-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, and protons has been previously reported, ferroelectric thin films behave largely as radiation-hard materials (retaining critical function-ality in the material) at radiation doses up to hundreds of krad, and often several Mrad.10–14However, there is evi-dence, even at the lowest doses, that radiation exposure cre-ates defects or activates existing defects, causing measurable changes in the fundamental material properties.Radiation transfers energy to a material via electron exci-tation and ionization, generating electron-hole pairs; or through nuclear interactions, giving rise to lattice vibrations and atomic displacements. Low energy (below �75 keV) pho-tons (X-rays, gamma rays) and electrons do not have suffi-cient energy to directly create atomic displacements and therefore interact with materials by exciting electrons, ulti-mately leading to trapping at defect centers.15At higher ener-gies, these particles ionize the material with which they interact and have sufficient energy either directly (electrons) or indirectly (gamma ray Compton scattered electrons) to form Frenkel defects, i.e., vacancies and interstitial pairs.16 The displaced atom, or recoil, will also lose energy through ionization and may have sufficient energy to create additional0021-8979/2016/120(2)/024101/9/$30.00120, 024101-1Published by AIP Publishing.

The larger mass also increases the probability of displacement events and subsequent defect cascades, ultimately leading, in some cases, to defect clustering and amorphization for high doses.17 In a ferroelectric material, defects are of particular im-portance, as the elastic and electric energies associated with defects (point, line, surface, or volume) are responsible for changes in the energy landscape and resulting motion of in-ternal interfaces across this landscape.18,19The substantial ferroelectric and electromechanical responses in ferroelectric thin films, such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT), are in large part due to extrinsic contributions of hysteretically and nonli-nearly mobile internal interfaces, such as domain walls and phase boundaries (see Figure 1).18,20The mobility of these interfaces is determined by the internal energy landscape of the material, owing to electric and elastic fields associated with lattice defects, including vacancy and dopant point defects, grain boundaries, and other internal interfaces (such as other domain walls), as well as hetero-interfaces with the electrodes and/or the substrate.21,22To simplify the follow-ing",986

In studies of fatigue and retention loss in PZT thin films, the role of the ferroelectric–metal electrode interface has been previously highlighted: defects can move, accumulate, and self-order near the interface, resulting in large volumes of domain wall pinning and inhibited ferroelectric response.23–26Prior research also supports formation and/or thickening of existing non-ferroelectric layers near the PZT–metal electrode interface, the presence of which is a pri-mary source of degradation of response in ferroelectric thin films via restriction of domain nucleation and switching.27–31 Conversely, using conductive transition metal oxides as elec-trodes helps to reduce fatigue in ferroelectric thin films, sup-pressing polarization back-switching.32The improvement has been attributed to the reduced concentration of charged defects at the oxide–oxide (ferroelectric–conductor) interface compared with oxide–metal interfaces.24,27,28,31,33–35 While the interface between either the top or bottom electrode and the ferroelectric material can act as a site for defect accumulation and fatigue, the bottom electrode acts as a building block for film orientation. For instance, Pt is typi-cally employed due to its compatibility with the high temper-ature crystallization of the PZT thin films and can serve as template layer for (111)-textured PZT. Alternatively, the Pt layer enables thin seed layers to be used to induce a (001) texture in PZT thin film crystallization.36As such, studying various top electrode materials presents a convenient method to investigate the effects of defect accumulation at the PZT–electrode interface while decoupling the",416

It is therefore unlikely that the lattice strain response changes significantly after irradia-tion and, therefore, the change in einit is more likely due to domain wall motion contributions.These observations suggest radiation-induced, “high energy” pinning sites (defects) for the motion of the internal interfaces, resulting in increased vibration and decreased over-all motion of these interfaces, in terms of contributions to the dielectric response. We note that such higher-energy defects are consistent primarily with radiation-induced creation of trapped charges as a consequence of ionization events, i.e., deepening of the potential energy wells corresponding to pre-existing defects. These trapped charges can result in stabiliza-tion of domain walls at pinning sites or accumulation of charges trapped at grain boundaries, thereby resulting in addi-tional pinning.47 The above observations are also consistent with the appearance of a new maximum in the post-irradiation er-E curves for samples with Pt electrodes (Figure 6).

Various defects, such as domain wall pinning due to diffusion of charged defects and alignment of dipolar defects, are typically associated with pinching of hysteresis loops in previous studies.48–53It is also possible that irradiation locally disrupts polarization through the generation of electron-hole pairs. When these unbiased pairs equilibrate, the domain polarization randomly orients, leading to effects similar to those in aging of unpoled PZT.48 This proposed mechanism is further corroborated by the ESR data presented in Figure 8, at elevated levels of irradiation.45 The broadening of the ESR spectrum in irradiated PZT samples may indicate changes to oxygen vacancies already present in the system, where the gamma irradiation excites electrons that subsequently become trapped at these sites ( i:e: ; V��more mobile; therefore, their formation could lead to domain O!

However, since Pt is approximately twice as dense as IrO2 (21.5 vs. 11.7 g/cm3) and nearly three times as dense as PZT (7.5 g/cm3), one would estimate a significant dose enhancement in excess of 50% in the region beneath the Pt electrode as compared with the PZT covered by the IrO2 electrode.59,60The greater total ionizing dose at the metal electrode–PZT interface may contribute to the greater radiation-induced degradation observed in devices with Pt electrodes.V.",375

Edge Intelligence Micro_v15_final_submitted.docx,Abstract,"—The future Data-centric world with its many new applications demands Edge Intelligence.. Based on the requirements of the smart systems that are widely deployed at the edge and distributed in the field for EI, research vectors on multiple fronts of materials, devices, circuits and architecture are addressed.. Top-down and bottom-up approaches are needed.. Challenges with Moore’s Law scaling and limitations of the current von Neumann computing architectures combined with new promising discoveries of advanced CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric devices open the door for FerroElectronics.. Ferroelectric building blocks integrated on advanced CMOS technology nodes are enabling much needed computing capabilities to make Edge Intelligence a reality.. Pursuing In-Memory processing in Data-flow architectures is at the core of FerroElectronics Computing that drives the need to create small-system AI engines.. This will enable building 1000X more compute efficient engines that offer the performance needed for Edge Intelligence.. The Data-centric world will rely on smart IoT devices (EI-IoT devices), addressing a wide range of new applications that demand higher performance and more capabilities supporting local embedded intelligence, real-time learning and autonomy.. These EI-IoT devices will drive the next phase of growth in the semiconductor industry.. Micro drones examples with capabilities for perception, path planning, localization, mapping and optimization along with co-operative intelligence in swarms, sensor fusion, as well as applications of augmented reality in a small form factor (“smart glass”) that share similar computationally demanding tasks as uDrones are discussed in this paper.. INTERNET OF THINGS (IoT) in its “smart” form is becoming the next driver of the semiconductor industry.. We live in a world where huge amounts of data from our physical world around us are being IT Professional Published by the IEEE Computer Society XXXX-XXXX© 2019 IEEE Department Head sensed.. This data needs to be analyzed, reduced and acted upon.. Today this data is sent to a central location, the cloud, for analysis.. In the cloud, using established computing architectures, data is crunched to provide analytics and services for users based on known business models.. This cloud-centric model is not sustainable and will not be capable of meeting the requirements of the smart IoT world as explained in [1]..",502
Edge Intelligence Micro_v15_final_submitted.docx,discussion,"s. These two NN topologies are AlexNet NN topology and ResNet-50 NN topology.. For these two NN topologies, we will discuss the number of weight parameters and the required amount of MACs, assuming that each weight parameter needs approximately eight bits (8b) or one-byte (1B) of memory.. The AlexNet NN model and its variants have been shown to serve EI applications that require solving a combination of perception and optimization problems because this NN topology uses a combination of both convolutional and fully connected layers.. It requires ~60MB of memory and a computing performance of ~0.725 GMACs or ~1.5 GOPS.. The AlexNet NN topology has 5 convolutional and 3 fully connected layers representing a more balanced NN approach.. It requires memory and it relies on compute, but it is not all about computing such that it can be serviced purely by a systolic array of processing elements alone.. This topology applies to the uDrone example and for the in-field learning RL+TL using a mix of ~20% SRAM and ~80% eNVM to provide the right memory density, low write energy and high endurance write capable implementation [6], [7].. A dense and hierarchical embedded memory with a mix of volatile and non-volatile capability is chosen to avoid the memory wall problem and the energy cost associated with an external DRAM and FLASH memory combination used in computing solutions typically seen in the cloud.. At the edge and in our discussed topology for the uDrone, we need to go beyond stationary weights for inference-only applications.. First and for most, we will be requiring a dense low write energy profile embedded memory solution.. The ResNet-50 topology can be more suitable for perception class problems (deployed in imaging and vision applications) that use a deeper 50-layer NN with 49 convolutional layers and 1 fully connected layer.. This NN topology demands more computing and requires less memory.. ResNet-50 asks for ~26MB of memory and requires a computing performance of ~4 GMACs or ~8 GOPS.. To support both topologies, a computing performance of >10 GOPS and a memory density of >60MB at the NN level are needed..",504
Edge Intelligence Micro_v15_final_submitted.docx,results,".. The throughput is high, the read it fast, and the write energy of this charge-based embedded memory solution is good.. However, this memory is not dense enough (it consumes a large area in very expensive silicon on advanced technology nodes) for the workloads of interest in the data-centric systems utilizing IMC, for example storing the weights for doing inference.. SRAM leakage is high favoring the use of SRAM for systems that are computing with a high activity factor in order to amortize the leakage cost/penalty of the memory.. SRAM does not support multiple bits per cell.. It is based on 1 bit/cell and to achieve higher precision it needs to add them, using thermometer coding.. Capacitive banks (based on SAR ADC topology) add to its complexity (capacitive matching and offset cancelation) and add to the cost.. 8 IT professional SRAM IMC is based on mixed signal design and it is more efficient than digital-only implementations.. It targets lower precision applications and the periphery circuits are complex.. These issues lower the array efficiency for IMC.. Particularly it will be difficult to encode inputs in voltage or time.. This limits SRAM to toy and smaller problems with a low number of weigh parameters.. SRAM IMC is mostly targeted for binary NNs based on XNOR/XOR with low precision.. Since multiple wordlines are activated simultaneously, read disturb is a fundamental issue.. A bitline discharge in the SRAM array, which is required for high dynamic-range readout, threatens to write-back into the cell causing destructive read.. SRAM IMC happens locally on the bitline as we explained earlier (and it requires ADCs).. A better approach is to leverage the SRAM’s strengths and augment it with a dense eNVM [1], [4], [6], [7].. Based on our applications’ requirements, >100MB memory capacity is required, suggesting utilizing a mix of 20% SRAM (20MB) and 80% dense eNVM (80MB) [6], [7].. Referring to the three vectors of computing described earlier, more than computing for accelerating NNs (e.g.. CNNs/DNNs) is needed.. Other statistical ML algorithms for supporting other linear algebra kernels (beside the covered vector matrix multiplication) may not be as complex as deep NNs..",516

Comparison table of ferroelectric devices with other embedded (nonvolatile) memory devices. Ferroelectric devices are advantageous in terms of energy-efficiency and overall balanced performance [4], [5].computing problems. Beyond fixed flow NNs for vision and perception (in today’s systolic array data-flow architectures) this provides a path toward solving optimization with ADMM. Many factors need to be considered in designing circuits and IMC arrays: cell size, cell configuration (more flexible positive and negative operands with a differential 2T FEFET cell configuration without impacting peripheral circuits), number of bits/cell, symmetric potentiation/depression for higher accuracy computation, BL capacitance, number of cells per BL, number of rows and columns, number of activated rows for IMC, DAC and ADC resolutions, topology, type of ADC, and circuit style (requiring mixed signal circuit design) for IMC readout and sensing. A careful analysis of the circuit simulation of the full integrated circuit chip using the measured FEFET device parameters based on 28nm HKMG technology in [11] compared three chip implementations of systems for solving iterative convex optimization problem by ADMM via least-squares-minimization; (1) a digital von Neumann architecture implementation based on ALUs and embedded SRAM (Baseline), (2) an SRAM-based 6T-cell IMC implementation (SRAM-based IMC), and (3) an FEFET-based 2T-Cell, in pseudo-cross-point array for IMC implementation (FEFET-based IMC).

All three parameters: Energy, Delay and Energy-Delay Product (EDP) were better for implementation number (3), i.e. the FEFET-based IMC. In fact, the FEFET-based IMC consumes 65X less energy than the digital von Neumann baseline and 19X less energy than the SRAM-based IMC. The EDP for the FEFET-based IMC is ~9,400X lower than the EDP for the digital von Neumann baseline and 60X lower than the EDP for SRAM-based IMC. Note that the SRAM-based IMC occupies >3X larger silicon area than the FEFET-based IMC implementation. Exploring the design space shows that for parallel throughput computation using 12-bit DAC and 14-bit ADC with 3 bits/cell, the FEFET-based IMC implementation",191
Edge Intelligence Micro_v15_final_submitted.docx,results,"in the lowest energy and compute time. Using higher than 3 bits/cell increases the overhead and when the DAC resolution increases, a higher ADC resolution is needed, increasing the energy consumption. Device variability was accounted for in these simulations. The improved efficiency in computing achieved by the FEFET-based IMC was utilized for solving iterative convex optimization problems by ADMM via least-squares-minimization in two applications: (1) Constructing signal from 1D EEG and (2) Recovery of CT (Brain Computed Topography which is relevant for MRI) images used in medical imaging applications. 10IT professional The fidelity of reconstruction process increases as the sub-space dimension increases because the FEFET-based IMC has more computing capability. This enables real-time reconstruction of the data in the field at low-power consumption. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that solving an iterative algorithm like ADMM in the dataflow architecture resembles a hardware emulation of a distributed and discrete-time dynamical system that will be discussed later. For these imaging applications, accuracy is a system-level metric. A similar exercise for the uDrone application would use a different metric like collision avoidance as a key system-level metric. A uDrone uses computing for path finding, mapping, depth, localization/SLAM, and control in addition to vision-based navigation. The kinds of circuits and arrays we described for the FEFET-based IMC can help doing more computation for these functions and algorithms. SMALL-SYSTEM AI AND THE ENGINE FOR EDGE INTELLIGENCEThe engine for EI should be more than a simple inference engine. Perception and optimization class problems (model-free and even model-based), and ultimately in-field learning by RL for autonomy (for uDrone applications) all need to be handled by such an engine. A small-system AI engine should be capable of handing the real-time low-latency learning in the field through RL+TL using a combination of eSRAM and FEFET memory. Learning is critical in the case of uDrones if there is no GPS coverage. When the uDrones need to be autonomous, providing a means to learn by interacting with their environment is critical and challenging, since the uDrone needs to move seamlessly at a reasonable speed of 10 m/s. In that case, model weights need to be updated frequently (for learning) and in a short amount of time with a latency of <10 ms. RL can be viewed as a form of learning by trial and error based on reward mechanisms. Learning places a demanding burden on write time, write energy and endurance cycling performance of the embedded memory solution used in IMC. This explains why dense FEFET’s potential for fast ns write time at low fJ/bit write energy with an improved endurance of at least 1010 cycles is a game changer for these learning applications. eSRAM and magnetic/spin-based STT-MRAM were used in a memory hierarchy for RL in systems for uDrones by mapping the algorithm carefully into to this memory hierarchy [6]. The algorithm utilizes both convolutional and fully connected layers. The fast and changing fully connected layers use eSRAM while convolutional and slow changing fully connected layers are placed in denser eNVM. In the case of [6], the choice of eNVM was STT-MRAM. The write time (latency) and write energy of this choice of eNVM determines the performance of the system and is limited by the magnetic/spin technology capability; although this hierarchical approach allowed for an overall improvement in speed of the uDrone by allowing processing performance at a higher data rate measured by fps, but it did not meet what is needed for 30 fps at 10 m/s and without any loss in system-level accuracy metric. Using FEFET-based eNVM and moving to more advanced technology nodes will significantly improve the performance of such small systems for these applications. If more computing capability is needed for the uDrone application for path planning, mapping, depth, localization/SLAM, and control in addition to the vision-based navigation, then an FEFET-based IMC provides the more computing required. The uDrone example is an interesting platform for exploring various compute demands such as (1) model-free, learning-based statistical solutions by NNs, etc. and (2) Model-based solutions by the potential fields approach utilizing various linear and non-linear processing units. Therefore, capabilities enabled by new Ferroelectric-based materials and devices such as the FEFET-based IMC circuits will be key to realizing small-system AI engine’s computation demands. This goes beyond current research in curating data, pruning, compression, condensing the weights or techniques for tweaking the precision based on today’s technology features that have been widely discussed and continue to be explored in the literature [2], [3]. Going back to today’s solutions (e.g. GPU engine) operating at an energy efficiency of 1 to 10 TOPS/W and considering the gains in delay reduction by a factor of ~140X and improvement in energy efficiency by a factor of ~65X for the FEFET-based IMC as shown in Fig. 4, the system performance compared to these digital von Neumann architecture (Baseline) solutions can be enhanced by implementing an IMC architecture. The",1231

Furthermore, Data-Flow Architectures are deployed based on a systolic array of processing elements where pre-determined data flow paths are being implemented with shared memory, inching their way toward Near-Memory Computing implementations.. The next phase in architecture enhancement will be re-visiting and implementing In-Memory Computing (IMC) with a dense and low-energy profile embedded memory to eliminate the “memory wall” problem, providing more energy efficient higher compute performance needed to move toward in-field learning..

A similar exercise for the uDrone application would use a different metric like collision avoidance as a key system-level metric. A uDrone uses computing for path find-ing, mapping, depth, localization/SLAM, and con-trol in addition to vision-based navigation. The kinds of circuits and arrays we described for the FEFET-based IMC can help doing more computa-tion for these functions and algorithms.SMALL-SYSTEM AI AND THE ENGINE FOR EDGE INTELLIGENCE The engine for EI should be more than a sim-ple inference engine. Perception and optimization class problems (model-free and even model-based), and ultimately in-field learning by RL for autonomy (for uDrone applications) all need to be handled by such an engine.A small-system AI engine should be capable of handing the real-time low-latency learning in the field through RLþTL using a combination of eSRAM and FEFET memory. Learning is critical in the case of uDrones if there is no GPS coverage. When the uDrones need to be autonomous, pro-viding a means to learn by interacting with their environment is critical and challenging, since the uDrone needs to move seamlessly at a reasonable speed of 10 m/s. In that case, model weights needet al.,6the choice of eNVM was STT-MRAM. The write time (latency) and write energy of this choice of eNVM determine the performance of the system and is limited by the magnetic/spin technology capability; although this hierarchical approach allowed for an overall improvement in speed of the uDrone by allowing processing per-formance at a higher data rate measured by fps, but it did not meet what is needed for 30 fps at 10 m/s and without any loss in system-level accu-racy metric. Using FEFET-based eNVM and mov-ing to more advanced technology nodes will significantly improve the performance of such small systems for these applications.If more computing capability is needed for the uDrone application for path planning, mapping, depth, localization/SLAM, and control in addition to the vision-based navigation, then an FEFET-based IMC provides the more computing required. The uDrone example is an interesting platform for exploring various compute demands such as 1) model-free, learning-based statistical solutions by neural network, etc.; and 2) model-based solutions by the potential fields approach utilizing various linear and nonlinear processing units.Therefore, capabilities enabled by new ferro-electric-based materials and devices such as the FEFET-based IMC circuits will be key to realizing small-system AI engine’s computation demands. This goes beyond current research in curatingto be updated frequently (for learning) and in adata, pruning,compression, condensing theshort amount of time with a latency of <10 ms. RL can be viewed as a form of learning by trial and error based on reward mechanisms. Learning pla-ces a demanding burden on write time, write energy, and endurance cycling performance of the embedded memory solution used in IMC. This explains why dense FEFET’s potential for fast nanosecond write time at low fJ/bit write energy with an improved endurance of at least 1010cycles is a game changer for these learning applications. eSRAM and magnetic/spin-based STT-MRAM were used in a memory hierarchy for RL in systems for uDrones by mapping the algo-rithm carefully into this memory hierarchy.6The algorithm utilizes both convolutional and fully connected layers. The fast and changing fully connected layers use eSRAM while convolutional and slow changing fully connected layers are placed in a denser eNVM.

HZO DFT IEDM Kummel 8-4-2017.docx,INTRODUCTION,"For integration of ferroelectric oxides on Si, SiGe, or Ge, the most practical choices are based on HfO2 and HfxZr1-xO2 (HZO). DFT calculations were performed to understand the possible sources of stability for the orthorhombic ferroelectric phases (f-phase) of HfO2, ZrO2, and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 as opposed to the bulk stability of the monoclinic phases. In nanocrystalline materials, the surface (or interfacial) free energies will dominate the thermodynamic stability. Furthermore, it is known that films with high f-phase content can only be formed when the films are capped with a crystalline electrode, typically TiNx. DFT calculations were performed for all three oxides to determine if the biaxial stress or strain from quasi-epitaxial growth on TiNx could stabilize the f-phase. In contrast to doped HfO2, the composition range for f-phase formation with HZO is quite large. In the present report, atom probe tomography (APT) was performed on TiN/HZO/Si structures to determine the film composition of the interfaces for indication of possible phase separation of HZO since phase separation could promote nanocrystal formation. II.DFTCALCULATIONS OF BULK STABILITYDFT simulations were performed with VASP code using projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials (PPs) and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional. HfO2, ZrO2 and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 unit cells for f-, m- and t-phases were relaxed at variable volume to optimize DFT lattice constants. HZO unit cells were optimized with 2 different placements of Hf and Zr atoms in the unit cell. For HfO2, ZrO2, and HZO, the most stable bulk phase is the paraelectric monoclinic phase denoted as “m-phase”. The ferroelectric phase has been identified as the orthorhombic phase denoted as “f-phase” and the antiferroelectric phase has been identified as the tetragonal phase denoted as t-phase. For all the phases, the m-phase was used as the reference state and assigned an energy of 0 meV. As shown in Fig 1, the f-phase is less stable by ~80 meV per formula unit (fu) and, therefore, would only be present at significant concentration at high temperature. These",588

Ushakov et al shows that tetragonal (or possibly orthorhombic) HfO2 and ZrO2 could readily be formed in thick solution deposited films if nanocrystals had diameters below ~10 nm [3].

[4] Similar",124
HZO DFT IEDM Kummel 8-4-2017.docx,experiment,"al data was employed by Materlik et al to develop an empirical model for HZO to show that f-phase might have a lower surface free energy than m-phase. [1] In the present report, the surface free energies of the major low index faces of the three oxides were calculated by DFT in a consistent manner. It is noted that in a nanocrystalline films, interfacial free energy with respect to the top and bottom electrodes and the amorphous grain boundaries will determine the exact surface energies; however, the surface free energies are a good starting point to understand if there are extremely differences which might result in preferential formation of a phase of nanocrystals. To model the surface free energies, an oxide column consisting of a 1x1x4 supercell was constructed. Vacuum layers of ~15 Ang were added, and the stacks were relaxed at 0K below 0.05 eV/Ang force tolerance. Several different surface cuts were tested for (001), (111) and (101). The cuts which provided both upper and lower surfaces with oxygen termination had the lowest energy and preserved the basic structure of the subsurface. As shown in Fig 3, the lowest energy structures of all three phases of HZO are nearly identical consisting of O atoms bonded to two Hf/Zr atoms. The nearly identical bonding configurations result in nearly identical surface free energies and are likely to result in nearly identical interfacial free energies to amorphous interfaces. As shown in Fig 3, for any given crystal face, the surface free energies are nearly degenerate between m-, f-, and t-phases. For all three oxides (HfO2, ZrO2, and HZO), the surface free energies of the three m, f, and t phases are nearly degenerate. This means that when a nanocrystalline phase is formed, a large fraction of the nanocrystals will be f-phase and therefore ferroelectric. It is also possible that a strong field could convert the t-phase to f-phase. IV.LATTICE MATCHING TO THE ELECTRODETo produce f-phase, the HfO2 or HZO must be deposited in the amorphous state and annealed with a top electrode typically TiNx. TEM shows regions of apparent epitaxial alignment [5]. Since TiN and Ti3N4 have different lattice constants than HfO2 or HZO, this will induce stress or strain which may stabilize f-phase. It is noted the lattice constants of HfO2, ZrO2, and HZO are within 3%. Isotropic, uniaxial, and biaxial stress and strain of HfO2, ZrO2, and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 were modeled by DFT with similar",614

As shown in Fig 5, for biaxial stress along either [111] or [001], if the volume per unit cells is decreased by ~5%, then f-phase becomes more favorable than m-phase. A further demonstration is shown in Fig 6. For gain diameters near 5 nm, the lowest energy structures have two extra TiN(111) unit cells compared to the number of HZO(111) unit cells. If the quasi-epitaxy occurs over less than 10 TiN unit cells (6.0 nm) then f-phase is more stable than m-phase. Nearly identical",175

For TiN, the DFT is also consistent with an additional force favoring f-phase formation for grains less than 6.0 nm. V. TEMANDAPT OF TIN/HZO/SITEM and APT were performed to determine if HZO promotes nanocrystal formation by phase separation. TiN/HZO/Si structures were grown with ALD HZO, sputtered TiN, and annealed at 600ºC in a manner similar to Ref 6. The films were cross-sectioned using focused ion beam (FIB). As shown in Fig 7, the TEM cross sections show columns of HZO atoms in apparent registry with the TiN lattice. Note TiN may be Ti3N4. There is an interlayer between Si and HZO which is identified as primarily SiO2 by TEM-EELS (not shown). APT finds likely SiOx at the film/Si interface (see below). The HZO next to the SiO2 IL is amorphous consistent with the HZO crystallization originating at the TiN interface. APT tips were prepared from the same sample by FIB. As shown in Fig 8, mass spectra were collected, and the peaks assigned to various metal, metal oxide, metal nitride, and semiconductor ions. The Hf, Zr, and Si counts resulting from ionic and elemental species are summed over the X-Y plane of a thin disc oriented transversely to the reconstruction. The disc is then scanned in the z (depth) direction to yield and axial concentration profile of the indicated species. As shown in Fig 9, the Hf and Zr profiles are not identical, which may be a detection artifact. Additionally, there is apparent Ti penetration into the HZO. To make a SiO2 assignment, the ROI should exclude the TiN layer to avoid mass overlap, Furthermore, isotopic analysis also verifies SiO2 in the IL. To reduce artifacts that erroneously render a “rounded” interface, a cylindrical ROI, coaxial with the reconstruction, was employed to constrain the analysis near the center of the reconstruction (Fig 10). The resulting concentration profiles are shown in Fig 11. Again, the Hf and Zr distributions differ, and only Zr is observed to have nitride peaks. Zr is known to crystalize at a lower temperature than Hf; therefore crystallization initiating at the TiN surface would be consistent with the TiN interface being more Zr rich than the Hf surface and the observation of exclusive Zr nitrides.

(fitted by (9)) when the Gibbs free energy change at 1000K (ΔG°1000 ) of the following reaction (1) has a large positive value. Continued Lg scaling beyond the 22 nm node requires EOT < 0.6 nm S+2MO→2xM+SiO (1) to suppress short-channel effects. EOT scaling with a gate-first yxyy2process is hampered by IL growth during high-temperature processes. Several approaches to circumvent this issue have been reported (2-6); however, they require direct modifications of high-κ and the adverse effects of scavenging metals in high-κ are not fully understood. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of remote IL scavenging and its advantages over a direct IL scavenging are shown. Then, we discuss the impact of intrinsic IL scaling and La and Al dipoles on electron mobility and propose physical models.

The order of the ΔG°1000 (M1 < 0 < M2 << M3) is in agreement with the EOT scaling trend, indicating that oxidation of M3 is the driving force of the reaction. The EOT scaling can be controlled by changing the amount of M3 as shown in Fig. 4. TEM reveals that the EOT change was brought about via IL scaling down to zero (Fig. 5). The EELS profile of M3 (Fig. 6) and the SIMS profile of O (Fig. 7) clearly support the concept of the remote IL scavenging. As seen in Fig. 8, the remote IL scavenging has 10× lower Jg compared to the direct IL scavenging.

These trends can be understood by the reaction model depicted in Fig 10, in which oxygen vacancies nMOSFETs with HK/MG stacks were fabricated using a gate-first process as shown in Fig. 1. After HfO2 and cap layers (La, Al) deposition, TiN films were deposited as metal electrodes and then scavenging elements (M1, M2, and M3) were doped in the TiN while maintaining an undoped high-κ/TiN interface. In the control samples, TiN-M3 and TaN-M3 alloy films were deposited to let M3 elements directly contact high-κ layers. Then, the MG/HK stacks (Vo) in HfO2 act as media for a cascade reaction of oxygen transfer from the IL to the M3 atoms in the TiN and thus [Vo] in HfO2 is maintained constant. Fig. 11 shows mobility benefits of the remote IL scavenging over the direct IL scavenging. The Vfb-EOT trends in Fig. 12 indicate that the EOT scaling by the remote IL scavenging and the effective work function (EWF) tuning by the La- and Al-dipole are additive, which makes this technique a viable option for 97-4244-5640-6/09/$26.00 ©2009 IEEE17.1.1IEDM09-423CMOS integration. B. Impact of Intrinsic IL Scaling and Dipoles on Mobility The electron mobility as a function of EOT is compared in Fig. 13 and the Id-Vg characteristics are shown in Fig. 14. The change of Id as a function of sensing time delay reveals that the measurement error due to charge trapping is negligibly small even for the scavenged IL stack (not shown). The trend for the remote IL scavenging is considered as the intrinsic IL scaling effect because of cancelled out and long and low density net dipoles may be formed. Since the dipole strength (length × density) remains the same, a sufficient Vt shift is still attainable while the mobility degradation by RCS is minimized. The previously mentioned models for high and middle Eeff mobility are summarized in Fig. 20. Finally, aggressive EOT scaling was performed by combining the remote IL scavenging and the La dipole. As shown in Fig. 21, a record-setting EOT (0.42 nm) for HfO2-based high-κ was achieved with an EWF close to nFET band-edge. Moreover, Fig. 22 demonstrates no extrinsic mobility degradation by the La dipole, as predicted by our model. no extrinsic fixed charge/dipole (Fig. 9) and no interface degradation, as indicated by a good subthreshold slope (Fig. 14).

Then, the temperature dependence of mobility was studied (Fig. 15(a)-(d)) to clarify the physical origin of the mobility-EOT trends. The surface roughness scattering limited mobility (µSRS) for each sample was extracted by extrapolating the mobility at 45K and Eeff 1MV/cm, where the temperature dependence disappeared. The µSRS-EOT trends at 45K are shown in Fig. 16(a). After subtracting µSRS from the total mobility (µtot) at 300K using Matthiessens’s rule, both the remote IL scavenging and the La addition show no degradation, as seen in Fig. 16(b). Considering the good interface properties and the EOT scaling for these samples, the mobility degradation is attributable to remote SRS (r-SRS) enhanced by IL thickness (TIL) scaling (10).On the other hand,the mobility degradation without EOT scaling for the Al addition suggests r-SRS enhanced by increase of amplitude of roughness (ΔTIL).

The reduction of the coercive field of the hetero-structures is governed by the interplay of the interfacial coupling, the interaction between polarizations within the constituents and the dielectric softness of the constituents.For a heterostructure of ferroelectric–paraelectric inter-face, the interfacial-aided polarization reversal may arise from two different origins: the formation of (i) interfacial-induced polarizations or interfacial-ordered states1,2)in the paraelectric constituent, or (ii) domain wall-like structures at the interface of the ferroelectric constituent.

Thus, the objective of this paper is to study the film thickness effect of HfO2 ferroelectricity from the viewpoint of ferroelectric phase formation and to demonstrate very thin HfO2 ferroelectric properties based on the understanding. The other is to study the reliability of thin ferroelectric HfO2, and to clarify the ferroelectric reliability/degradation origin particularly in the thin film region. II.",200

Dopant concentration was adjusted by changing the sputtering power of doped-oxide. Film thickness was inspected by X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurement. Cation ratio of dopant to Hf was estimated by XPS. Two types of metals (Au and TiN) were used for top electrode. Au was deposited after PDA, while TiN was deposited on HfO2, followed by PDA. Ferroelectric properties of all films were measured by P-V and I-V using ferroelectric analyzer at 10 kHz. The double pulse-measurements were carried out to especially check the thin film ferroelectricity in order not to be misled by the leakage current with the pulse width down to 2 s [4]. The reliability test was carried out by applying the triangular pulse with 100 kHz at room temperature and 125°C.

Hoffmann_Miko_Uwe_doped_HfO2_JAP_2015.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Ferroelectricity has recently been discovered to occur in Si doped HfO2.1Various other dopants2–6also have been reported to stabilize the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase of space group Pbc21 that is believed to be the origin of this previously unexpected behavior.1The crystallization of the, at room temperature stable, monoclinic P21/c phase was impeded by mechanical encapsulation with a thin elec-trode layer.7Whereas, the higher symmetry tetragonal (P42/ nmc) or cubic (Fm3m) phases were present in most ferro-electric HfO2 films.8The mechanisms that stabilize the ferro-electric phase of HfO2 are still not completely understood. The same applies to the electric field cycling behavior9 including wake-up10–12and fatigue effects.13,14Therefore, several influencing factors on the properties of ferroelectric Gd:HfO2 are investigated in this paper, such as film thick-ness,15annealing conditions,16and electrode interfaces.17 Possible structural causes for ferroelectricity and field cy-cling effects in doped HfO2, like grain sizes,18oxygen vacancies,19and potentially field induced phase transitions,20as a gate dielectric in modern field-effect transistors (FETs) for many years.22Mature deposition techniques like atomiclayer deposition (ALD) enable new 3D integration schemes for FRAM capacitors.23Additionally, ferroelectric FETs(FeFETs) have already been fabricated in a 28 nm high-kmetal gate technology demonstrating the potential of doped HfO2 for highly scaled memory devices.24The current International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors(ITRS) also states this material system to be a promising can-didate for future downscaling of FeFETs.21Classical ferroelectrics like PZT initially faced severeproblems with polarization fatigue while using Pt electro-des.25This problem was then solved by adopting new elec-trode materials like Ir or IrO2.26Typically, TiN electrodeswere applied in combination with ferroelectric HfO2 show-ing similar fatigue behavior.13,14Therefore, different elec-trode materials have been investigated recently, including RuO2,27Pt,17,28and Ir.18,29,30Although all of these electro-des were able to stabilize the ferroelectric phase, noimprovement compared to TiN was reported so far. In thisare discussed.ferroelectricrandomaccessmemorystudy, Gd:HfO2 capacitors with different combinations ofNon-volatileTiN and TaN electrodes as well as various annealing condi-(FRAM) based on classical perovskite ferroelectrics such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) or strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT) are not easily integrated into current silicon technol-ogy and face severe scaling limitations.21HfO2 on the other hand is a lead-free simple binary oxide that has been appliedtions were investigated. The influence on the electrical and structural characteristics is reported.

Hoffmann_Miko_Uwe_doped_HfO2_JAP_2015.docx,EXPERIMENT,"ALPlanar metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) capacitors were fabricated on p-doped Si (100) substrates. Initially, either TiN or TaN bottom electrodes (BEs) of 10 nm thickness were formed by reactive sputtering at room temperature. Thermal ALD at 300�C was then used to deposit Gd doped HfO2 films from HfCl4, Gd(iPrCp)3 and H2O precursors. An ALD cycle ratio of 27:1 (Hf to Gd precursor pulses) was applied to achieve a Gd content of 3.4 cat% (cationic ratio of Gd/[Gd þ Hf]) in the HfO2 layers as confirmed by elastic recoil detection analysis. By adjusting the number of ALD cycles, 10 nm to 27 nm thin films were fabricated as verified by X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements. Similar to the BEs, 10 nm thick TiN or TaN top electrodes (TEs) were de-posited by reactive sputtering at room temperature, whereby the TaN TEs were only used on samples that also had a TaN BE. The previously amorphous Gd:HfO2 films were then crystallized by a post metallization anneal (PMA) in an N2 ambient with different annealing conditions: 450�C for 10 min, 650�C for 20 s, 650�C for 10 min, and 800�C for 20 s. Finally, a Ti adhesion layer of 10 nm and a Pt layer of 50 nm were deposited by evaporation through a shadow mask to create circular contact pads of 200 lm diameter. These Pt dots also served as a hard mask during the subse-quent removal of the TiN or TaN TE in an etch solution con-taining NH4OH, H2O2, and H2O.XRR and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements were carried out on a Bruker D8 Discover (Cu-Ka radiation, k ¼ 0.154 nm) for structural analysis of the samples. Also, micro-spot XRD was measured at beam-line BL15XU, SPring-8. The few lm wide rectangular X-ray beam (k ¼ 0.10004 nm), concentrated through a two-dimensional lens, enabled us to characterize single contact pads before and after electric field cycling. Additionally, bright and dark field high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a FEI Titan3 80–300 microscope operated at 300 kV (equipped with a field emis-sion gun, CEOS CetCor CS-image corrector and a high angle annular dark field detector). Depth profiles of the elemental composition of the MFM stacks were obtained by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) on a TOF.SIMS 300R tool from ION-TOF GmbH. For the sput-tering beam, Csþions with an energy of 1 keV were used, while the analysis beam consisted of Biþions with 25 keV.Electricpolarizationandfatiguemeasurementswereconducted using a TF Analyzer 3000 with FE-Module (aixACCT Systems) at 10 kHz with the BE on ground poten-tial. Triangular and rectangular voltage signals were used fordynamichysteresismeasurements andfatigue cycling,respectively. Small signal capacitance-voltage measurements were carried out on a 4200-SCS Parameter Analyzer (Keithley Instruments) to obtain the relative permittivity k of the Gd:HfO2 films at 10 kHz and 30 mV small signal ampli-tude (rms).Using ab initio calculations conducted by the software package Abinit,31,32the total energies (Etot) of the mono-clinic, tetragonal, cubic as well as the orthorhombic Pbc21HfO2-phaseswerecalculated.Thecalculationswereperformed with a 24 atomic cell using a 3 � 6 � 6 k-Point grid and Troullier-Martins-pseudo potentials at an energy cutoff of 816 meV. One or two oxygen atoms were deleted from the 24 atomic cells to create vacancy concentrations corresponding to 6.25% and 12.5%. Calculations with vacan-cies were performed for both threefold and fourfold coordi-nated oxygen atoms deleted, as well as a mixture of both. Oxygen vacancies were calculated charge neutral, since it was assumed that the charge is compensated within the cal-culated supercell.III.",1043
Hoffmann_Miko_Uwe_doped_HfO2_JAP_2015.docx,DISCUSSION,"A. Impact of layer thickness and wake-up effectWhen measuring the polarization P vs the electric field E (P-E curves) on fresh Gd:HfO2 samples, a constricted hysteresis is obtained, corresponding to more than one dis-tinct current density peak in the J-E curves, as can be seen in Fig. 1 for 27 nm films annealed at 650�C for 20 s. After elec-tric field cycling, the current peaks merge into one distinct maximum, resulting in a broadening of the P-E hysteresis. This so called wake-up behavior has been reported for both perovskite11,12,33and doped HfO2 ferroelectrics.8This effect has to be taken into account especially for FRAM applica-tions, since remanent polarization Pr and coercive field Ec increase during field cycling. If not stated otherwise, Pr and Ec values given in the text or figures always refer to the posi-tive values, which are in most cases almost identical to the negative ones.The wake-up behavior previously reported for 10 nm Gd:HfO2 samples showed that more than 1000 field cycles were necessary to achieve a coalescence of switching current peaks.3,16In contrast, Fig. 1 shows that only about 5 cycles are sufficient to achieve a similar peak merging in 27 nm thick films. The root cause of this behavior in doped HfO2 is still not fully understood. One explanation is the occurrence of a field-induced phase transition during cycling, thatFIG. 1. Wake-up effect in 27 nm Gd:HfO2 with TiN electrodes cycled at 4.4 MV/cm.072006-3Hoffmann et al.J. Appl. Phys. 118, 072006 (2015)FIG. 2. Micro-spot XRD on single MFM capacitors before and after cycling.promotes a transformation from the paraelectric tetragonal/ cubic or monoclinic phases into the ferroelectric orthorhom-bic phase.20A different mechanism was proposed by Zhou et al., which involves the de-trapping of charged defects (like oxygen vacancies) from interfacial states near the electrode-ferroelectric junctions.10These defects suppress the nucleation of domains of the opposite polarity rather than pinning domain walls as seen in other bulk ferroelec-trics.25,34The origin of such defects in MFM stacks with TiN electrodes was assumed to be the formation of TiOxNy due to oxidation of TiN during HfO2 ALD and TE deposi-tion, resulting in a substantial aggregation of oxygen vacan-cies near the electrode interface.10,27The PMA especially favors further interface oxidation of TiN electrodes in MFM stacks.35 To further investigate the possibility of a field induced phase transition, micro-spot XRD was measured on single MFM capacitors before and after 1000 switching cycles.

The slight difference in peak intensities does not point to a possible phase transition, since the diffractograms had to be measured on different contact pads, whereas the peak positions were used to determine the lattice parameters a, b, and c for the orthorhombic phase before and after cycling. Assuming that the (200) peak at 34.3�belongs to the orthorhombic pattern, three peaks were available to calculate the lattice constants given in Table I.

Hoffmann_Miko_Uwe_doped_HfO2_JAP_2015.docx,results,"presented later (Figs. 4 and 8). The change in lattice con-stants through field cycling is quite small and suggests that a field induced phase transition is not the dominant mechanism causing the wake-up effect in these ferroelectric thin films. Therefore, the de-trapping effect discussed earlier, which depends on the electrode interfaces, appears to be more likely.Fig. 3(a) shows a dark field TEM of a 27 nm sample with TiN electrodes. Single grains are clearly visible on the left side with lateral dimensions of about 30 nm. This coin-cides with reports of 20–30 nm big grains in other HfO2 based ferroelectrics.8,37Thus, it seems typical for these ferro-electric HfO2 films that grain boundaries are mostly oriented perpendicular to the capacitor surface at least up to a film thickness of about 30 nm. Since dark field TEM is able to detect grains with the same orientation, it is likely that mainly single grain domains exist in Gd:HfO2. A recent pie-zoresponse force microscopy study20has also shown that fer-roelectric domains in Si:HfO2 typically contain about one to three grains. A closer look at the interface between the Gd:HfO2 and the TiN BE is given in the TEM in Fig. 3(b). The polycrystalline structure of the BE influences the growth and orientation of grains during the PMA. The irregularity of the TiN BE highlighted by the arrow on the right side in Fig. 3(b) for example coincides with the grain boundary of the Gd:HfO2 film directly above. The interface is also not atomically abrupt, presumably due to the formation of a TiOxNy layer between TiN and Gd:HfO2.10,27This reinforces the view that the crystalline structure of these ferroelectricReference 4———5.245.015.05FIG. 3.

GIXRD patterns for different Gd:HfO2 film thicknesses and refer-ence patterns for the different reported phases of HfO2.films can depend strongly on the quality of the electrode interfaces and the applied materials. All of the ferroelectric films investigated here were polycrystalline and showed no preferred texture.A more detailed insight into the crystal structure of Gd:HfO2 films with various thicknesses can be obtained from the GIXRD patterns in Fig. 4. Since all samples showed clear ferroelectric properties, the existence of a significant amount of the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic Pbc21 phase can be expected. However, it is difficult to deduce this from the GIXRD patterns alone, since almost all orthorhom-bic peaks are superimposed by the patterns of the other phases. While the 10 nm sample shows mostly a tetragonal/ cubic structure, an increase in film thickness yields a higher fraction of monoclinic grains, as can be clearly seen from the increasing peak intensities at 25�, 28�, 32�, 45�, and 56�. This is in accordance with other recent reports on the thick-ness dependence of the crystal structure of HfO2 based ferro-electrics.15,38Moreover, an increase of the monoclinic phase fraction was also observed for higher thermal budget PMAs.15,16,38Those trends are in good agreement, since the crystallization temperature decreases for thicker films.15 The trend of less tetragonal/cubic and more monoclinic phase fraction with increasing thickness is also consistent with the decreasing relative permittivity k of the films, as canbe seen in Fig. 5(a). The higher symmetry phases also have higher k-values (tetragonal k � 32–40,8,38cubic k � 40–50 (Refs. 40 and 41)) compared to the monoclinic (k � 17–20 (Refs. 38 and 41)) and the orthorhombic phase (k � 30 (Refs. 4 and 41)). Contrary to previous reports,18,38no drop in Pr occurred for thicker films, which was argued to originate from the lower k-value of the monoclinic phase as a separate layer that lowers the effective field seen by the ferroelectric.38 Since the k-value for 27 nm is still close to 30, it is reasonable to assume that the monoclinic phase fraction is too low to induce such effects here. It is also important that the doped HfO2 films are amorphous before PMA, since crystallization during TE deposition",1135
Hoffmann_Miko_Uwe_doped_HfO2_JAP_2015.docx,results,"in a strong reduction of Pr.15In this work, even a small increase in Pr can be seen in Fig. 5, which is likely attributed to a slightly higher field E that was applied to the thicker samples while measuring the P-E curves.19Nevertheless, the absence of a degradation of Pr even for 27 nm films suggests that Gd is especially suited to stabilize the ferroelectric phase for a wide range of layer thicknesses and, as reported before, annealing conditions.16 For Gd:HfO2, ferroelectricity is caused for a wider range of dopant concentration compared to Si:HfO2,8which mightexplaintheabovementionedthicknesscharacteristics.Similarly to Pr, an increase of Ec with the layer thickness is apparent from Fig. 5(a). A higher Ec was also reported for higher thermal budget PMA (Ref. 16) and likely depends on the grain sizes of the films and also the electrode interfaces as will be discussed Section III C. Fig. 5(b) shows the Pr vs thickness dependence of the samples investigated in this work, compared to previous reported thickness trends for HfO2 based ferroelectrics. It can be expected that Gd:HfO2 follows a similar trend of decreasing Pr when going to even thicker films beyond 30 nm. Bigger grains lead to less influ-ence of the surface energy that in general favors the higher symmetry phases such as the tetragonal phase reported in HfO2 thin films.42Therefore, the monoclinic phase fractions in the films will increase further and degrade the ferroelectric properties. However, the critical thickness at which this occurs for Gd:HfO2 may be even higher than for Y:HfO2, while also achieving a higher Pr. The ferroelectricity drops more drastically for Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 due to a deposition tempera-ture close to the crystallization temperature of the layer43and for Si:HfO2 since the thicker films crystallized already during TiN TE deposition.15Both of these process conditions favor the monoclinic phase.FIG. 5.

Phys. 118, 072006 (2015)The preliminary findings show some general trends that corroborate the current understanding of how phase transi-tions in doped HfO2 thin films can be influenced by basic process parameters. Combining these",662
Hoffmann_Miko_Uwe_doped_HfO2_JAP_2015.docx,results,", we propose a qualitative model describing the dependence of the film crys-tallinity on the thermal budget, dopant concentration, and film thickness as can be seen in Fig. 6. While a higher ther-mal budget, a lower dopant concentration or a higher film thickness leads to more monoclinic films, the opposite leads to more tetragonal/cubic films. The ferroelectric orthorhom-bic phase exists somewhere at the phase boundary between those paraelectric phases. Depending on the dopant used, the influence of these parameters can be different. Gd:HfO2, for example, shows no degradation of the ferroelectric properties over a wide range of thicknesses and annealing conditions.16 While the process window for Si:HfO2 appears to be much smaller in this regard.15Generally, dopants with a higher ionic radius seem to have a wider process window regarding stabilization of the ferroelectric phase.6,8B. Impact of electrode material and annealing conditionsThe interface between the electrodes and the ferroelec-tric is not only important for the crystallization of the films during the PMA, but arguably also for the wake-up behavior as discussed in Section III A. Therefore, different electrode configurations in combination with different PMAs were investigated. MFM stacks containing 10 nm Gd:HfO2 films with TE/BE configurations TiN/TaN and TaN/TaN interest-ingly showed very different ferroelectric properties com-pared to their TiN/TiN counterparts. Fig. 7 shows the corresponding Pr and k-values for different annealing conditions.The use of TaN as an electrode material introduces a strong temperature dependence regarding Pr and k. Pr increases from 13 lC/cm2for TiN/TaN with the 450�C PMA to more than 35 lC/cm2for TaN/TaN with the 800�C anneal. Compared to the TiN/TiN samples (see Fig. 5), a twice as high Pr can be achieved just by replacing TiN with TaN. So far, this is the second highest value reported for HfO2 based ferroelectrics next to La:HfO2.8However, it is interesting to note that the Pr for TiN/TaN at 450�C is lowerFIG. 6. Qualitative model of the phase transitions of HfO2 influenced by theFIG. 7.

Consistently with the previous",610
Hoffmann_Miko_Uwe_doped_HfO2_JAP_2015.docx,results,",16k decreases for higher thermal budget PMAs. The k-value of 43 for TaN/TaN annealed at 650�C is very high compared to previously reported values for HfO2 based fer-roelectrics and hints at a considerable amount of the cubic phase in this sample. To further elucidate this, Fig. 8 shows the GIXRD patterns of all samples with TaN electrode(s).From the k-values discussed before, one might expect an increasing monoclinic phase fraction for a higher thermal budget PMA as seen in the thickness dependence. However, in contrast to Fig. 4, there are now much fewer peaks with increased intensity corroborating this view. Again, there is a slight increase at 56�, but most other monoclinic peaks are superimposed by orthorhombic peaks, which should also increase with the annealing temperature as expected fromFIG. 8.

Comparing the 18 nm and 27 nm film patterns from Figs. 4 to 8 gives the impression that MFM stacks with TaN electrode(s) generally have a lower monoclinic phase fraction than TiN/TiN stacks. This is con-sistent with the extracted k-values for all samples with the 650�C, 20 s PMA. If the monoclinic phase fraction does not significantly increase with the thermal budget, the other pos-sibility left is a transformation of the tetragonal/cubic phases into the orthorhombic phase. This would account for the decreasing k-values as well as for the increase in Pr and leads to the",424
Hoffmann_Miko_Uwe_doped_HfO2_JAP_2015.docx,conclusion,", that mainly the orthorhombic phase frac-tion increases, while the tetragonal/cubic phase fractions decrease with higher thermal budget PMA. Especially, the three peaks between 80�and 90�have been used in previous studies to identify the orthorhombic phase.2An absence of three distinct peaks does not imply an absence of ferroelec-tricity, but the better they can be distinguished, the higher the orthorhombic phase fraction appears to be. This is also consistent with the model proposed in Fig. 6. By using TaN electrodes, the samples are closer to the boundary between the tetragonal/cubic and the ferroelectric phase, so that a higher thermal budget can still increase the orthorhombic phase fraction without increasing the monoclinic one.C. Fatigue and wake-up revisitedFor the targeted application of ferroelectric thin films in FRAM capacitors, not only the wake-up, but especially the fatigue behavior is of importance for reliability assessments. Fatigue describes in this case the continuous reduction of Prthrough a sufficient amount of electric field cycling. This effect has also been a problem in perovskite based ferroelec-trics, but could be overcome by adopting electrodes like Ir or IrO2 in the case of PZT.26In this regard, a direct comparison of the three different electrode configurations TiN/TiN, TiN/ TaN, and TaN/TaN is of interest. Figs. 9(a)–9(c) show the wake-up behavior of the different electrode configurations for the 650�C, 20 s PMA.The J-E curves show obvious differences between the electrode materials. For two identical electrodes, the J-E and P-E curves are quite symmetrical, whereas the mixed elec-trodes in Fig. 9(a) result in an asymmetric hysteresis. This stems from the difference in Ec for both TiN (�1.5 MV/cm) and TaN (�2 MV/cm) electrodes. The positive Ec of the TiN/TaN sample is closer to the TiN-value, and the negative one correspondingly is closer to the TaN-value. Since the work functions of TiN and TaN are quite similar,33,44they cannot account for this difference. Thus, the quality of the interfacial layer between electrode and ferroelectric could be one of the main influences on Ec beside the grain size.36The wake-up procedure for all three samples is considerably slower compared to the 27 nm TiN/TiN sample from Fig. 1. This seems plausible regarding the report that the wake-up effect also decreases in ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films for higher PMA temperatures.38The amount of the tetragonal phase fraction seems to play an important role, looking at the GIXRD data in Figs. 4 and 8. Gd:HfO2 films appear to show a more pronounced wake-up behavior when they exhibit a higher tetragonal phase fraction. This would also explain the faster wake-up for the 27 nm sample in Fig. 1, since theFIG. 9. Wake-up behavior of 10 nm samples with (a) TiN/TaN, (b) TiN/ TiN, and (c) TaN/TaN electrodes.

Hoffmann_Miko_Uwe_doped_HfO2_JAP_2015.docx,results,"presented in Fig. 2. A more reasonable argument could involve the increasing influence of the electrode inter-faces for thinner films, leading to a pronounced wake-up effect. Oxidation of the electrodes leads to oxygen vacancies in the Gd:HfO2 films. If these defects influence the field cy-cling behavior as proposed in Ref. 9, effects on thicker films will be obviously smaller, since the bulk of the ferroelectric is significantly bigger compared to the interface regions. Fig. 9(d) shows the evolution of the positive and negative Pr-values (Prþ and Pr�) with the number of applied field cycles. The TiN/TiN sample shows a typical wake-up behavior up to 104cycles, when fatigue sets in and Pr decreases again.For the TaN samples, no fatigue is visible before hard break-down occurs. Also in the TaN/TaN samples, the dielectric breakdown occurs earlier than in TiN/TaN samples, which is an indication for the amount of defects in the films.14A strong asymmetry of the TiN/TaN sample is also visible in the Prþ and Pr� evolution shown in Fig. 9(d).It is reasonable to assume that the formation of different interfacial layers between Gd:HfO2 and different electrodes is of importance in this behavior. The annealing temperature and time have a very pronounced effect on Pr and on the field cy-cling behavior for samples with a TaN electrode, which was not observed for TiN/Gd:HfO2/TiN stacks before.16Assuming TaN electrodes are more inclined to form an oxynitride45,46at the Gd:HfO2 interface compared to TiN,47,48more oxygen vacancies would be present in the ferroelectric samples with TaN electrodes. This would explain the earlier breakdown for TaN samples in Fig. 9(d), since oxygen vacancies are known to facilitate breakdown mechanisms in HfO2.14This can be substantiated by the data shown in Fig. 10. Not only is the breakdown behavior consistently the best for TiN/TiN and the worst for TaN/TaN samples but the trend of earlier breakdown for higher thermal budget PMA can also be explained in a similar fashion. A higher annealing temperature or time leads to a stronger oxidation of the electrodes, effectively scaveng-ing O from the Gd:HfO2 layer and thus creating more oxygen vacancies that lead to earlier breakdown of the films.14 Correlating an earlier breakdown behavior with the higher Pr values seen for higher thermal budget in Fig. 7, oxygen vacan-cies may also play an important role in stabilizing the ferro-electric orthorhombic phase in doped HfO2. Leakage currents of the different samples were comparable, indicating that the difference in oxygen vacancy density was too low to be discri-minated by the measurements so far.FIG. 11. ToF-SIMS",633

Still, there appears to be a difference in the interfaces of TiN and TaN electrodes. Subtracting the TaO2�-background-signal of Fig. 11(a) from Fig. 11(c), there still seems to be TaO2 left throughout the whole HfO2 layer. This would point to a larger interface oxidation of TaN compared to TiN electro-des, but measurement artifacts, like sputtering of Ta into the HfO2 film, cannot be ruled out completely. It is interesting to note, however, that the CN�-signal in the Gd:HfO2 is lower for TaN/TaN compared to the other samples. This might be due to the excellent diffusion barrier behavior of TaN as it is used in the fabrication of copper interconnects.21Regarding the effect of oxygen vacancies on the ferroelectric properties of the films, the ToF-SIMS and leakage current measure-ments were not sufficient to undoubtedly prove the impor-tance of these defects in doped HfO2 so far.Therefore, ab initio simulations on the influence of oxy-gen vacancies on the phase stability of HfO2 were carried out. Fig. 12 shows the change in the total energy difference between the various phases compared to the monoclinic phase as a function of oxygen vacancy concentration, aver-aged over all calculated vacancy positions for a given con-centration. The tetragonal and the cubic phase gain the most in terms of total energy change, closely followed by the fer-roelectric Pbc21 phase. In the observed range, the change inFIG. 12.

Therefore, the ferroelectric properties of Gd doped HfO2 MFM stacks with different thicknesses, electrode materials, and annealing conditions were investigated in this study. While thinner films showed more of a mixture of tetragonal/ cubic and orthorhombic phases, thicker films up to 27 nm exhibited increasing monoclinic phase fractions in addition to the orthorhombic phase in accordance with a reduction of permittivity values. Surprisingly, no degradation of Pr with increasing film thickness was observed, suggesting that Gd is particularly suited to stabilize the ferroelectric phase even in thicker HfO2 layers at the investigated doping concentration of 3.4 cat%. In accordance with previous",617

Additionally, lattice constants of the orthorhombic Pbc21 phase were calculated from micro-spot XRD patterns matching previously reported values. The structural origin of the wake-up behavior of different MFM stacks was investi-gated, concluding that a field induced phase transition as the main mechanism is unlikely. Moreover, the electrode inter-face formation and thus the density of oxygen vacancies appear to have an important influence on the wake-up effect.TaN electrodes were shown to considerably enhance the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase in HfO2 compared to TiN, yielding a Pr of up to 35 lC/cm2, one of the highest val-ues reported so far. In general, MFM stacks with TaN elec-trodes exhibited lower monoclinic and higher tetragonal/ cubic phase fractions compared to TiN electrodes, as con-firmedbyGIXRDandpermittivitymeasurements.Additionally, the TaN samples showed less signs of polariza-tion fatigue during field cycling, and also earlier breakdown. In contrast to samples with TiN electrodes, Pr and break-down field strength were strongly dependent on the anneal-ing conditions during PMA for samples with TaN electrodes. These effects were attributed to a higher amount of oxygen vacancies in the films, originating from an increased inter-face oxidation compared to TiN samples and for higher ther-mal budget annealing. Ab initio simulations revealed that the total energy of the orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic072006-9Hoffmann et al.J. Appl. Phys. 118, 072006 (2015)phases can be reduced compared to the monoclinic phase by incorporation of oxygen vacancies in the lattice.

Uwe_Miko_La_HfO2_FE_InorgChem_2018.docx,INTRODUCTION,"For material scientists, the new class of inorganic HfO2-based ferroelectrics are of special interest, because they are lead-free, simple binary oxides, and exhibit a nonperovskite structure with a remarkably low relative permittivity (∼20−30) compared to∼300 or greater permittivity of conventional ferroelectrics like Pb(Ti,Zr)O3.1Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in doped HfO2,2a variety of different dopants (e.g., Si,3Al,4Y,5Gd,6La,7 Sr8) have been examined to discover the dopant material with best properties for applications in semiconductor, piezo-, and pyroelectric devices. Dopants with an ionic radius smaller than Hf typically showed ferroelectric and anti-ferroelectric charac-teristics in a narrow dopant range. Larger dopants exhibited only ferroelectric behavior but have a wider process window.9 The polar orthorhombic phase (Pca21) was suggested as the origin of the ferroelectric properties.2,10Nonetheless, there is a substantial mismatch between the exciting material aspects of this new ferroelectric together with the proven application potential on one hand and the significant lack of basic studies on how to influence material properties and perturbing effects on the other hand. Lanthanum-doped HfO2 is the perfectexample to highlight this point.

The 100 and 110 diffraction peaks at 18 and 25° can be observed up to 13 cat% La-doped HfO2 film, but they cannot be detected when the La content increases beyond 15 cat%. These peaks can be observed for the monoclinic and the orthorhombic phase, but they are forbidden for the tetragonal and the cubic phase. Such changes can be attributed to the transition from the orthorhombic to the cubic phase. Shimizu et al.25reported that the 110 diffraction peak at 18°disappeared when the dominant crystalline phase of epitaxial Y-doped HfO2 film changes from the orthorhombic to the tetragonal phase with increasing Y content. Within the GIXRD pattern of the 20 cat% doped film, the split of diffraction peaks at 51° disappears, suggesting that the predominant crystalline phase is the cubic phase.

For a La content of 5 cat%, the aspect ratio is 1.03, which is believed to be associated with the dominant orthorhombic phase. With increasing La doping concentration from 5 to 13 cat%, the aspect ratio decreases reaching a value of 1.02 at the highest orthorhombic phase content of 10 cat%. At 13 cat% La doping, the aspect ratio becomes even smaller than 0.99, and with further increasing La content the aspect ratio saturates. The aspect ratio of 0.99 is smaller than the ideal one for the cubic phase (1.00). This observation can be attributed to in-plane tensile stress, which was reported for atomic layer deposited ferroelectric Si-doped HfO2 and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films.18,26The aspect ratio smaller than 1 in Si-, Al-, and Gd-doped HfO2 thin films in Park et al.’s previous study17might also originate from the effect of tensile stress. The stress in the La-doped HfO2 thin films will be discussed in more detail in Figure 4 and the related text. The change of the unit cell volume also shows an interesting dependence on the La content. The unit cell volume of the orthorhombic (or cubic phase) portions decreases with increasing La content up to the doping concentration of 14%. It increases with further increasing La content up to 33 cat%. As previously mentioned, the GIXRD patterns of 20 and 33 cat% La-doped films show only diffraction peaks from the cubic phase instead of the tetragonal phase, as it was considered for other doped HfO2 thin film in Park et al.’s previous study.17 Therefore, the cubic phase will be referred to as the dominant phase for highly La-doped HfO2 thin films in the following text. This result agrees on one hand with theoretical predictions that dopants larger than Hf generally stabilize the cubic phase instead of the tetragonal phase,27but on the other hand, it is different from what is seen in bulk materials that are not subject to size, strain, or interface effects. In bulk counterparts, it is expected that a La2Hf2O7 secondary phase is formed at these concentrations.28,29 In the present work, there was no evidence of this secondary La2Hf2O7 phase in XRD and moreover not in the TEM study, which is discussed in the later part of this section. The ionic radius of La3+(116 pm) is by 40% larger than that of Hf4+(83 pm);30therefore, the lattice parameters and the interplanar distances are expected to increase for higher La doping concentration. Thus, the unit cell volume is assumed to2756 DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b03149Inorganic ChemistryArticleFor the macroscopically effective values of Pr and Ec, the texture of the thin film, that is, a preferential orientation of the grains, plays an important role.

Moreover, when tilting the scattering vector away from the sample normal by increasing the angle Ψ of the goniometer, the intensity of the 002 peak decreases, while it increases for the 111 peak. This gives evidence of a comparably prominent 002 fiber-like (uniaxial) texture along the substrate-normal direction. Moreover, the peak positions in Figure 4a allow the analysis of the residual strain in the films via the sin2(Ψ) method.31,32The corresponding analysis of the 111 and 002 peaks is shown in Figure 4b. From the (extrapolated) dhkl values at sin2(0°) = 0 and sin2(90°) = 1, the interplanar distances for out-of- and in-plane directions can be obtained. Out-of-plane interplanar distances of d111 = 294 pm and d002 = 253 pm are found, while their in-plane counterparts are larger by 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively. The corresponding in-plane stress can be estimated based on some assumptions. First, we assume Young’s modulus of 284 GPa and Poisson ratio of 0.3, as reported in ref 33. For the calculation of in-plane stress, we further set the out-of-plane component of strain as zero to make a simplified calculation for in-plane stress. In reality, there is a finite out-of-plane strain, since the loading condition is plane stress. Under these assumptions, we determine ∼2 GPa of tensile stress for the in-plane directions. Though only an estimate for the order of magnitude of the stress effect, it reveals the large values of stresses that are apparent in the films. A more rigorous treatment of the stress state would account for the nonzero, out-of-plane strain, though it would also require a stress-free reference lattice constant as was shown by Nino et al.34With a stress-free reference state, the hydrostatic component of strain can also be extracted. Unfortunately, identifying a stress-free reference for orthorhombic HfO2 is not straightforward, since powders that are typically used as",488
Uwe_Miko_La_HfO2_FE_InorgChem_2018.docx,results,"correlate nicely to the measured remanent polarization values. Only in the La dopant range that showed orthorhombic properties in XRD a remanent polarization is detected. Polarization-electric field (P-E) measurements reveal a clear linear dielectric behavior for a low La content less than 4 cat% La. At 4−5 cat% La the hysteresis loop is opening, and the remanent polarization is steadily increasing to a maximum Pr value of 27.7 μC/cm2for 10 cat% La. Beyond 13 cat% La, the Pr value is decreasing again until ∼20 cat%, when almost no ferroelectric properties are visible anymore. In most cases, a pinched hysteresis is visible for pristine samples implying the presence of internal bias fields (Figure 6a).52This pinching of the hysteresis disappears during field cycling indicating a reduction of the internal bias (Figure 6b; see also Section 3.4). This effect was described before39,37as a nonuniform distribution of oxygen vacancies at the TiN/HfO2 interface or domain boundaries, which are trap sites that can be charged and likely impact polarization switching and domain pinning. Field cycling could lead to a more equal distribution of these charged O vacancies and thus cause a reduction or disappearance of the internal bias fields. Another explanation would be that vacancy positions and other trap sites are locally fixed and that only a redistribution of trapped electrons cause depinching of the hysteresis. Only for the La:HfO2 sample with 16 cat% La, a pinched P-E loop was measured, which remained during field cycling. Only a slight depinching is visible, which is discussed in more detail in Section 3.4. Accordingly, none of the samples showed a strong field-induced ferroelectric behavior as reported for Si- and Al-doped HfO2 as well as for a HfxZr1−xO2 mixed oxide. Only at 20 cat% La a small field-induced hysteresis might be present. Differences to smaller dopants could be related to a change in phase transition. For Si: and Al:HfO2 and mixed HfxZr1−xO2 a transition from the orthorhombic to the tetragonal phase occurs when enhancing the dopant content. For La as for other dopants larger than Hf, a transition to the cubic phase is suggested (see Section 3.2). It is believed that field-induced ferroelectric behavior can mainly occur in predominantly tetragonal samples.A clear linear relation between the o-phase fraction and the pristine Pr value is found similar to other dopants like Si, Al, or Gd (Figure 6d) indicating a content independent texture of the film.Extrapolation of the relation is implying a maximum remanent polarization value of ∼30 μC/cm2for a 100% orthorhombic phase fraction. This value is higher than expected for a random orientation of the grains. Theoretical calculations for pure HfO2 determined a maximum remanent polarization of 50−52 μC/cm240,41for the orthorhombic HfO2 phase leading to a Pr value of ∼26 μC/cm2for a random grain orientation.42 XRD",693

(b) Extracted charges of the depolarization current measurements using 200 and 320 °C as poling temperatures (see Supporting Information for details).content an intersection value change up to ±0.4 V is detected, which completely disappears for a La content of more than 10 cat% and increases again for 16 cat% La. This trend is similar for both polarity directions, indicating that only in the La content region between 10 and 13 cat% stable ferroelectric properties exist. This is consistent with a high orthorhombic phase portion in this concentration region. Furthermore, an average shift of the hysteresis along the electric field axis typically descript as imprint (change of the difference between the positive and negative intersection value) of 30 ± 3 mV after 1 × 104field cycles compared to the pristine case is calculated for all different La/Hf compositions indicating no clear composition dependent behavior (Figure 8a). Since a hysteresis biasing is typically related to charge trapping in the interfacial regions to the electrodes,43a stable shift of the hysteresis to a certain positive bias reveals a higher amount of negative charge at the interface to the top electrode, indicating a different interface property at the top and bottom electrodes. Since this shift is already visible at room temperature an even stronger behavior is expected for elevated temperatures. More detailed studies are needed to characterize this behavior. Furthermore, in Figure 8a the voltage shift for the last measurement point before breakdown is plotted as a function of the La content. Since the field cycles to breakdown increase for higher La content, also a stronger voltage shift is expected, assuming the shift is caused by charge trapping during field cycling.43,44 Indeed this is observed in Figure 8a, where the voltage shift2760 DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b03149Inorganic ChemistryArticleFigure 10.

The current peak at 275°C is separated by poling only at 200 °C, which does not allow charges with higher activation energy to move (see Figure SI 8b). The activation energies are determined by using the initial rise method46as 0.45−0.51 eV (see Figure SI 8c) and 1.23−1.46 eV (see Figure SI 8d) depending on the applied poling voltage.

Above 20 cat% La mainly cubic phase portions are detected (see Figure 3c), and applied electric fields are not able to transform the film into the polar phase. Pešić et al. explained the wake-up behavior by field-induced oxygen vacancy movement from the electrode interfaces to the HfO2 bulk causing a phase transformation of nonpolar monoclinic phase portions to the polar orthorhombic phase.37Since oxygen vacancy movement could not be confirmed with certainty in the former sections, a pure field-driven phase change without oxygen vacancy movement might be an alternative explanation. Similar processes might occur for cubic phase portions for a La content greater than 13 cat%. Since the field drop over the monoclinic domains (with lower dielectric constant) is expected to be higher compared to the one over the cubic domains, a different wake-up slope might be expected when a different ion vacancy movement or field-driven phase change is assumed in the effective field, resulting in a stronger wake-up for monoclinic phase portions containing samples in contrast to cubic counterparts.Compared to other dopants like Si and Al processed in a similar metal−insulator−metal capacitor structure and using the same TiN electrodes and annealing conditions, La shows a similar wake-up slope ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 μC/cm2per decade. However, overall samples with a La content of 13 cat% have the lowest wake-up slope as shown in Figure 11a. This behavior indicates less pinching in the pristine case, which suggests that the charge distribution in the highly La-doped sample is more uniform, and less domain pinning is present. Higher crystallization anneal temperatures for a 10 cat% La sample improved the wake-up properties due to the enhanced orthorhombic phase for annealing temperatures of 800−1000°C (Figure SI 2).All samples show a dielectric breakdown after a certain number of field cycles. This hard breakdown event occurs for a2762 DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b03149Inorganic ChemistryArticletal Section) on pristine samples that decreased during field cycling.52As a model, a redistribution of charges37from the TiN electrode interfaces toward the HfO2 bulk and within the interface and domain boundary regions is suggested. As discussed in the beginning of the Electrical Characterization section, these charges can pin domains, thus causing a pinched hysteresis loop.During field cycling, a redistribution of charges at trap sites (e.g., oxygen vacancies) within the HfO2 could lead to a phase transformation and more uniform distribution of pinning centers, which consequently",736

In all cases, a reduction of the internal bias field (defined as the difference in Ebias of both FORC maxima) with field cycling is verified (Figure 12a−c). The initial value decreases from ∼2.4 MV/cm for 7.5 cat% to 1.6 MV/cm for 16 cat% La. These Ebias values follow an exponential reduction with the number of cycles Ebias ≈ −m·log10(cycles), resulting in a vanishing of the internal bias field after 1 × 106field cycles for all samples except the 16 cat% case. The slope m improves from 0.16 to 0.38 MV/cm per decade with higher La content below 13 cat%, similar to the improvement in wake-up behavior with increasing La content, as discussed in the beginning of this section. Again, only the sample with 16 cat% La is not following the general trend. The internal bias field of 1.5 MV/cm is lower for the pristine sample with 16 cat% and changes much less with cycling (slope m ≈ 0.2 MV/cm per decade). The linear reduction of the internal bias field (Figure 12d) with increasing La content could be related to a reduced amount of trap sites with enhanced La concentration, which would not be expected for a higher amount of trivalent La in HfO2. A lower amount of trap sites would improve the wake-up behavior as indicated by the slope for field reduction. As mentioned before, only for samples with significant cubic portions the wake-up behavior is modified.

Since the well-known monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic phases have an inversion center, they cannot be expected to show ferroelec-tricity; the most plausible candidate for a ferroelectric phase is the orthorhombic phase. In actuality, the measurement of crystal structure in previous studies has pointed out the ex-istence of the orthorhombic phase.1However, a detailed study on the crystal structure of ferroelectric HfO2-based thin film is difficult due to random orientation of polycrys-talline films. Moreover, the multiple phase coexistence of-ten makes it more complex. Recent transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations have ensured the existence of an orthorhombic phase, and simultaneous convergent beam electron diffraction has revealed the space group of Pca21, which is a polar structure and is expected to exhibit ferroelectricity in the orthorhombic phase.10Although TEM observation has a powerful ability for structurala)E-mail: funakubo.h.aa@m.titech.ac.jpanalysis, usually it requires reducing thickness with compli-cated processes, i.e., destructive observation.Epitaxial film growth is one of the suitable approaches to elucidate a material’s crystal structure as well as the na-ture of its ferroelectricity. Epitaxial thin films are defined as films with well-defined orientations in both out-of-plane and in-plane directions with respect to those of the substrates. Studies on the basis of epitaxial ferroelectric film have al-ready achieved much, elucidating the nature of ferroelectric materials including nanoscale switching physics, domain structure, and also crystal structure.11–14However, ortho-rhombic HfO2-based epitaxial films have not been obtained, and it is still unclear whether or not growth is possible. Most orthorhombic HfO2-based ferroelectric films have been pre-pared by the crystallization of amorphous films with various deposition methods,1,15,16but epitaxial growth, especially for oxide films with good crystallinity, requires higher depo-sition temperatures than these methods. In addition, it is known that solid solutions of HfO2 and other oxides tend to decompose into cubic and monoclinic phases, as suggested by the equilibrium phase diagram.17 In the present study, the epitaxial YO1.5-substituted HfO2 films, i.e., xYO1.5-(1�x)HfO2 films, were grown on YSZ substrates by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. Because the ferroelectricity of YO1.5-substituted HfO2 sys-tems in the film form has previously been demonstrated with various deposition methods,5,15,16we employ YO1.5 as a dopant. Moreover, the monoclinic, tetragonal, and also orthorhombic phases have been found in powder sample of YO1.5 substituted HfO2.18Our detailed crystal structure anal-ysis shows the growth of an orthorhombic epitaxial film with0003-6951/2015/107(3)/032910/5/$30.00107, 032910-1V C 2015 AIP Publishing LLC032910-2Shimizu et al.Appl.

The substrate tempera-ture and atmosphere were maintained at 700�C and 1.33 PaO2 during the deposition.The h-2h XRD patterns were measured by a high-resolution diffractometer (SmartLab, Rigaku). In order to determine constituent phases, a wide-area reciprocal space mapping measurement (WRSM) was performed by XRD equipment (D8-discover, Bruker) with a large area 2-dimensional detector (VANTEC-500) under sample-rotation conditions. In addition, high-temperature XRD was observed with a temperature-controllable sample stage (DHS-1100, Anton Paar). Structure analysis was conducted using an aberration-corrected annular bright-field scanning transmis-sion electron microscopy (ABF-STEM) (JEM-ARM200F Cold FEG, JEOL) to visualize the crystalline structure in atomic resolution including oxygen atoms. The images wereobserved under the condition as follows: the accelerating voltage was 200 kV, the convergent semi-angle a 20 mrad,and the collection semi-angle b 11–22 mrad. For STEM observations, thin foils were fabricated using a conventional mechanical polishing and Ar ion milling methods (PIPS model 691 and PIPS II model 695, Gatan).

It is worth mentioning that the post-crystallization of the amorphous film, by which the ferroelec-tric orthorhombic films are obtained, is one way to obtain a solid solution. Another possibility to obtain orthorhombic phase is due to epitaxial strain. The theoretical calculation by Materlik et al. indicates that the epitaxial strain is possible to stabilize ferroelectric orthorhombic phase.21 In order to elucidate that the orthorhombic film in this study is ferroelectric orthrohombic phase, we performed ABF-STEM imaging.

However, further investigation is needed to clarify the ferroelectricity in epitaxial films.The structural phase transition provides strong evidence of ferroelectricity because most polar materials with switchable polarization show a phase transition from high-symmetry para-electric to low-symmetry ferroelectric phases with decreasing temperature. Fortunately, 110 diffraction can be observed in the orthorhombic phase, which is considered to be a ferroelec-tric phase, while such diffraction is not seen in the tetragonal phase, which is expected to be paraelectric. Therefore, 110 dif-fraction is a useful probe for detecting this phase transition.

In addition to the strong peak around the 2h angle of 50�, the weak 110 peak at around 24.5�can be observed in the pattern measured at room temperature. Note that the peaks at around 29�and 47�, which are marked by star symbols in the figure, came from the carbon dome of the mea-surement set-up.

FeFET characteristics are strongly affected by unstable Qt (unrelated to ferroelectric) which causes Vth instability just after programming, and stable Qt which compensates most of electric(E)-field generated by Ps. Stable Qt is coupled to Ps with constant ratio (~90%), and reduce MW to the value much lower than the coercive voltage (Vc) limitation. Unlike the conventional model, Ps increase and stabilization are still effective to improve MW and retention, respectively. During cycling, MW is degraded by ∆Ps reduction as well as the increase of the compensation ratio (∆Qt/∆Ps) which can be mitigated by suppressing charge injection/ejection via interfacialSiO2.",206
09265055.docx,Introduction,": HfO2 FeFET has attracted much attention as a promising emerging memory because of its high speed/low voltage operation and CMOS compatibility. Recently, a huge amount of Qt at the interface close to 1014 cm-2 in FeFET has been reported [1, 2]. Although it has been suggested that the charge trapping affects Vth instability after programing (prog.) [2, 3], retention [3, 4], and the limited endurance [3, 5], the accurate amount of ∆Ps as well as ∆Qt during memory operation and their impact on the MW and reliability have not been understood yet. In this study, we extract both ∆Ps and ∆Qt directly from FeFET under various operating conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, we re-examine the dominant factors of the memory characteristics and reconstruct the improvement guideline.",181
09265055.docx,discussion,"s: We measured poly-Si channel thin-film transistor with Si-doped ferroelectric (FE)-HfO2 of 10nm. Cross sectional TEMis shown in Fig. 1. The thickness of interfacial SiO2 is around 1.5nm. We newly developed a convenient analysis scheme that can extract both ∆Ps and ∆Qt during prog., retention and cycling from one-time current measurement of a single FeFET (no need for Hall measurement unlike [1]). Fig. 2 shows the concept of the analysis and the measurement sequence. Vth shift after erase (Vg<0) /prog. (Vg>0) operation is shown in Fig. 3. Vth just after prog. shifts to the positive direction which is opposite to the expected direction, then Vth decreases drastically in about 10sec. After 1000sec, Vth increases again. The change of Ps and Qt caused by prog. and the subsequent time evolution derived from (1)-(4) (Fig. 2a) are shown in Fig. 4a. Qt larger than Ps is generated temporarily, but a part of Qt disappears within 10sec (I). After that, the state is stable until 1000sec, then Ps and Qt start to decrease together (II). From these characteristics, the charges produced by prog. can be divided into the unstable component which disappears in 10sec and the stable component which does not change until 1000sec as shown in Fig. 4b. These components are also clearly separated in the erase operation (Fig. 4c). Unstable charge trapping:As shown in Fig. 4b, the unstable component is dominated by Qt. The positive Vth shift caused by prog. and the following Vth reduction with time are also observed in FETs with paraelectric-HfO2/SiO2 as shown in Fig. 5. So, the unstable Qt (electron trapping: e--trapping) originates in the defects unrelated to FE. In an FeFET, the E-field modulation due to the excessive e--trapping induces a small amount of the unstable Ps. Stable charge compensation of Ps at the interface: In the stable component, Qt is quite large and close to Ps as shown in Fig. 4b. The correlation of Qt with Ps extracted by changing the prog. condition (Fig. 6a) is shown in Fig. 6b. ∆Qt is almost 90% of ∆Ps regardless of the prog. condition. This proves that the stable Qt completely follows the Ps and inevitably compensates the most of 978-1-7281-6460-1/20/$31.00 ©2020 IEEEPs. As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the following feedback would occur: Ps increases the E-field across SiO2 and causes e--injection, and consequently charge compensation at the interface decreases the E-field across SiO2, then high E-field across HfO2 is maintained even at large Ps. Fig. 7 shows the dependence of MW on Ps. Although the large Ps (> 10uC/cm2) is realized, only 10% of Ps contributes to MW because of the charge compensation. As a result, MW is proportional to Ps for a wide range. So, Ps increase still directly contributes to MW enlargement. This is significantly different from the conventional FeFET model (ideal situation) where Vc is the indicator of MW for such a large Ps. Impact of each component on Reliability: Correlation of Qt and Ps is maintained even in the long-term retention (Fig. 8). Despite the E-field across SiO2 should accelerate e--injection via SiO2, Qt decreases with Ps reduction which is possibly caused by the depolarization field of FE-HfO2 as shown in Fig. 9. This means that the Vth shift in long-term domain is triggered by Ps change, not by charge injection. This is also different from the conventional model. To improve the retention, Ps stabilization is essential. Fig. 10 shows the cycling characteristics. MW starts to reduce after 1k cycles (Fig. 10a). One of the origins for MW reduction is ∆Ps decrease (Fig. 10b). ∆Qt also decreases with ∆Ps but the ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio increases with cycling then reaches almost unity (Fig. 10b). ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio increase is critical, because ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio of unity vanishes MW even if the decrease of ∆Ps can be suppressed. To verify the possibility that the increase of ∆Qt/∆Ps originates in the stabilization of e--trapping unrelated to FE, Ig-Vg during erase at each cycle are compared in Fig. 11a. The peaks belonging to the e--trapping unrelated to FE disappear within 100sec even after the cycling. So, the larger ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio after cycling is not caused by the stabilization of the e--trapping unrelated to FE. As shown in Fig. 11b, ∆Qt is also proportional to ∆Ps even after 100k cycles. From these",1098
09265055.docx,results,", it is suggested that the trap sites which can compensate Ps stably increase with cycling as shown in Fig. 11c. The excessive prog. stress which causes a larger amount of the unstable e--trapping (Fig. 12a) accelerates ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio increase, while the unipolar stress does not cause the degradation as shown in Fig. 12b. This means that the repetition of e--trapping/de-trapping via SiO2 caused by the unstable components induces the additional trap sites at the interface which can compensate Ps and indirectly affects ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio of the stable component. The charge trapping/de-trapping caused by the stable component itself presumably has more impact on ∆Qt/∆Ps ratio increase by cycling, because ∆Qt of the stable component is much larger than the unstable component as shown in Fig. 4b. Revised model and guideline: Dominant factors of the memory characteristics are summarized in Fig. 13a. Compared to the conventional model assuming the ideal situation and additional charge trapping, a huge amount of Qt completely coupled to Ps strongly dominate the whole memory operation in the revised model as shown in Fig. 13b. Based on this model, we developed the improvement guideline: Ps increase/stabilization, and suppression of charge injection/ejection via SiO2, all of which are supported by the",294
09265055.docx,Conclusion,"s: Behaviors of both Ps and Qt during FeFET memory operation were quantitatively revealed by the newly developed analysis. A huge amount of stable interface trap charges coupled to Ps significantly alters the operating model of FeFET memory. Ps increase and stabilization are still effective for MW and retention improvement, respectively. Suppression of charge injection and ejection via SiO2 is a key to higher endurance. 2020 Symposium on VLSI Technology Digest of Technical Papers - TF1.2Authorized licensed use limited to: Georgia Institute of Technology.

clima_DFT_IEDM_2018.docx,INTRODUCTION,"The Ferroelectric Field Effect Transistor (FEFET) is one of intensely developed emerging memory concept [1]. The built-in spontaneous polarization of the FE insulating layer (Fig. 1 left) shifts the threshold voltage (Vt) in a positive or negative direction (hysteretic window Fig. 1 right), as a function of the polarization direction, which defines the memory window. Some FE films show during initial cycling (wakeup/ poling stage) a pinched hysteresis window (characteristic of antiferroelectric AFE materials) that opens-up to a single Polarization-Electric field (P-E) loop (characteristic of FE switching) with increased remanent polarization (Fig. 2). The origin of the poling in FE-HfZrOx is not clear. Since the typical film thicknesses are of the size of a single grain and correspond to a column of ~ 10 switching HfO2 unit cells between electrodes [2, 3], it is reasonable to investigate the process of single phase transformations from the atomic model point of view, before diving into complex domain dynamics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the atomistic mechanisms that could be responsible for the wakeup/poling behavior in FE Hf1-xZrxO2. The polarization reversal process in FE/AFE materials is usually represented as a double/ triple-well potential energy curve (blue curves Fig. 3a-d and most of other figures presented here). Since the first derivative (dU/dP) is proportional to the electric field, the observed P-E loops will resemble the red loops in Fig. 3 (red area - the unstable region) [4]. The",355
clima_DFT_IEDM_2018.docx,experiment,"al evolution of the P-E loops is a strong indication that wakeup/poling should come from a AFE-FE phase transformation. For the first time, we show how the evolution of the polarization reversal kinetic barriers with the applied strain, phase transformations kinetic barriers (m P21/c �o Pca21, o Pbca �o Pca21) and/or the (de)stabilization of the tetragonal atomic arrangement (P42nmc) with strain can explain the poling (AFE�FE) behavior. We discover four different phase transformations that can reproduce the AFE pinched P-E loop. Also, we show that defects such as VO can significantly II.TEST STRUCTURES AND METHODOLOGYThin films down to 4nm thickness have been deposited and characterized in 100x100�m metal-insulator-metal (MIM) configuration between 10nm TiN electrodes for short-loop assessment of ferroelectric properties. First-Principles simulations were carried out using Density Functional Theory in the QuantumEspresso package [5]. We combined ultrasoft pseudo-potentials with planewaves and PBE functional to compute the Nudged-Elastic Band kinetic barriers on 13 images with statically applied strain (mechanical from electrode interfaces or from piezoelectric response of the material) on the unit cell. III.HFXZR1-XO2FILM MORPHOLOGYHfxZr1-xO2 film morphology is rather rich in crystallographic phases. Lowest-energy structures for HfO2 are listed in Fig. 4a, labeled by their symmetry/energy ordering [6]. o-I/o-III/t-I phases do not show a low-energy transformation to a non-centrosymmetric system and most importantly, their diffraction pattern is distinctive and missing in the",428
clima_DFT_IEDM_2018.docx,experiment,"al measurements. Therefore, we will refer to the o-II (Pbca)/o-IV (FE Pca21) as o phase (their XRD patterns are difficult to distinguish), t-II (AFE P42nmc) as t and cubic/monoclinic as c/m. Strained systems can have several different atomic positions (c/t/FE) for the same cell shape (c/t/o). Thus, when discussing phase transformations, we will refer to cell shape changes under strain, but within each case, a FE↑ �FE↓ polarization reversal proceeds along A-path (Pbcm) or B-path (Fm3m or P42nmc centrosymmetric atomic arrangement, Fig. 4b) By means of a XRD intensity fitting procedure (Fig. 5), we can estimate the approximate crystalline phase ratio in our films (Fig. 6). The amount of c phase is insignificant, only a hint of o phase, more m and predominantly t phase is found in the film (Fig. 6). IV.POLARIZATION REVERSAL PATHSPolarization pathways have been under scrutiny in recent years [7, 8]. Maeda et.al. identified six ferroelectric switching pathways in o-IV (Pca21) FE HfO2 [8], two of them have high energy barriers, the other four pass through three types of centrosymmetric structures: A-path (Pbcm) and B-path (tetragonal P42nmc and cubic Fm3m shown in Fig. 4b) during the switching of polarization. For the relaxed o-HfO2 structure, the B-path (P42nmc mechanism) is lowest in energy (Fig. 7), but is strongly influenced by the strain in the system: under in-plane compressive strain stabilizes the centrosymmetric 978-1-7281-1987-8/18/$31.00 ©2018 IEEE16.5.1IEDM18-380tetragonal structure (Fig. 13b). The A-path mechanism is the least influenced by the strain (not shown). V. VO DEFECTSDefects in materials break the local symmetry, hence can dramatically change the energy landscape for the polarization reversal. Here we investigated the effect of ~ 2% oxygen vacancy on the kinetic barriers for polarization reversal following A/B-path (Fig. 8). The B-path (only P42nmc mechanismsFig. 8a-c) is energetically favored when VO is positively charged, with a 50-70% lower barrier. The A-path also shows reduced kinetic barriers with VO and charge injection (Fig. 8d-f), but the barriers are higher if compared to B-path. VI.PHASE TRANSFORMATION UNDER STRAINHf/Zr-O bonds in HfZrOx are very sensitive to the strain applied to the system, be that external (substrates/ interfaces) or internal (Hf:Zr ratio or other dopants). High-resolution TEM show several domains of different phases (c/o/t/m) in the same crystalline grain [2]. Here we computed the kinetic barriers for some of these phase transformations and polarization reversal barriers (where applicable) in the absence of external fields. All the described phase transformations are possible mechanisms for wakeup/poling. A.Monoclinic-orthorhombic (mP21/c� o Pca21) As",781
clima_DFT_IEDM_2018.docx,experiment,"ally observed, the m-o transformation can proceed with a gliding mechanism, given the right strain tensor (Fig. 9). This process requires less than 230meV/f.u., which is of the same order of magnitude with FE polarization reversal barrier (Fig. 10). The m-o transformation creates polarized phase, the potential energy curve resembles the triple-well AFE curve (nonpolar m between FE↑ and FE↓). B.Orthorhombic-Orthorhombic (o-II Pbca � o-IV Pca21 ) The atomic configuration in the o-I structure was found to be incompatible with polarization of any type (FE or AFE). o-II, on the other hand, consists of two o-IV FE cells with the polarization anti-aligned (AFE phase). FE alignment of the two sub-cells must cross the same energy barrier as the normal FE switching, however, in this case the A-path mechanism is C.Tetragonal-Cubic A compressive strain along the C axis in the t phase destabilizes the centrosymmetric arrangement, leading to FE atomic arrangement (Fig. 12) [10]. In other words, a tensile strain on the tetragonal long axis leads to the stabilization of a non-polar system, but upon the strain relaxation, the FE atomic arrangement becomes more stable. The potential energy curve, corresponding to the",311
clima_DFT_IEDM_2018.docx,experiment,"ally fitted strain of the t phase shows two metastable local minima (Fig. 12brown arrows/ configurations) that are non-polar. Hence a strain relaxation process in the tetragonal P42nmc system or polarization of the nonpolar distorted t/c configuration can also account for the poling effect. D.Tetragonal-Orthorhombic Applying a uniaxial elongation of the tetragonal in-plane cell parameter, we can observe a strong destabilization of the P42nmc centrosymmetric atomic arrangement (Fig. 13a blue arrow) during polarization reversal along the B-path. It indicates that t phase under tensile in-plane strain would polarize (t-o transition). The Fm3m mechanism of the same strain shows reduction of the NEB barrier (Fig. 13b), whereas the A-path mechanism is not impacted (not shown). Since the deposited film show ~75% tetragonal (AFE) phase (Fig. 6), we conclude that this is the predominant mechanism for P-E loop wakeup. The change in Hf/Zr ratio has a linear impact on the cell size (Fig. 13c), therefore an increase in Zr content in HfO2 leads to an internal strain: in our fixed-cell polarization reversal NEB simulations, the Zr content affects the barrier in the same way as the compressive strain does (Fig. 13d,a).

For pristine state, the memory window by±4 V sweeping for non-irradiated devices is 1.48 V which does not degrade with 300-krad and 10-Mrad radiation dose even though the remnant polarization (Pr) decreases due to radiation-induced oxygen vacancies (Vo) and lattice distortion in the ferroelectric material HfZrOx (HZO). With the radiation dose level, the devices still hold the current ratio between “1” and “0” state of 2.2 × 103by extrapo-lating to 10 years at 25◦C, which is comparable to that of non-irradiated devices. The most adverse effect of radiation is the deteriorated endurance caused by the increased number of Vo during cycling test (+5.5 V, −5 V/10 μs) as evidenced by memory window of 0.52 V at 106cycles for devices with 300-krad radiation dose. Furthermore, robust HZO and SiOx interacial layer against radiation is required to suppress the bond break so that the reliability can be improved.devices for modern electronic systems, has been extensively investigated for radiation tolerance. For TID effect, thresh-old voltage variation, leakage current increase and retention degradation for high dose condition have been reported for cell devices of flash memory while peripheral circuitry is more vulnerable to TID effect since devices in the circuitry including high-voltage charge pump are with thick oxide thickness which is prone to trap charges.Ferroelectricfieldeffecttransistor(FeFET)memory,another promising non-volatile memory technology that can be the successor of flash memory, has aroused intense research interests for years since it enjoys fast switching and ultra-low power operation.

Nevertheless radiation effect has been explored for FeFET for years, most studies focus on conventional perovskite-type ferroelectric materials such as Bi3.15Nd0.85Ti3O12 (BNT) [1] and SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) [2] which cannot be integrated with VLSI technology and there-fore poses a limitation for further applications [3]. With the advent of VLSI-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric material, it ushers in a new era of FeFET memory.Although plentiful attempts have been made to improve the reliability performance of HfO2-based FeFET memory, the impact of TID on memory characteristics were rarely dis-cussed. Highly stable metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) capac-itors based on HfYOx under γ -ray radiation was first reported by Huang et al. [4] and demonstrated high immunity from radiation in terms of little changes of basic ferroelectric para-meters which is much improved as compared to conventional ferroelectric materials. Recently, Xiao et al. reported that HfZrOx (HZO) MFM capacitors on flexible mica substrate shows robust ferroelectricity against γ -ray radiation with 1 Mrad dosage [5]. Wang et al. [6] further investigated proton radiation effects on HfYOx MFM capacitors which it is highly resistive to proton radiation. However, almost none of previous studies refer to the actual HfO2-based FeFET memory which are formed on Si substrate rather than metal. The major structure difference between HfO2-based FeFET memory and MFM capacitor is the interface between ferroelectric material and the underlying substrate.

It is the inferior interfacial quality that makes reliability issues, especially for endurance, a main concern for HfO2-based FeFET memory [7]. Therefore it is worth advancing the radiation study by transforming the platform from MFM capacitors to FeFET memory to bet-ter understand how radiation affects memory characteristics.

After initial clean of the Si wafer, HfZrOx of 12 nm was deposited as the FE material by nano-laminate thermal ALD with HfO2:ZrO2 = 1:1 cycle ratio at 250◦C. Next, TiN was deposited to form the gate electrode. Then source/drain implantation by phosphorous was performed after required patterning. Finally the FeFET memory devices were complete by rapid thermal annealing at 600◦C for 30 sec to concurrently activate the source/drain dopants and crystalize the HZO into orthorhombic phase for ferroelectricity.

All types of devices show counterclockwise hysteresis which implies that ferroelectric induced dipole switching rather than charge trapping dominates the hysteresis. From the transfer charac-teristics, 3 phenomena are observed after irradiation including (1) increased ID at off state, (2) higher ID at on state, and (3) almost unchanged subthreshold slope. For phenomenon (1), it may arise from irradiation-induced charge accumulation in the field oxide near the active region that makes leakageFig. 2.

For phenomenon (2), it may be caused by radiation-induced trapped holes in the oxide that forms higher electron concentration at the extended S/D region, reducing series channel resistance as shown in Fig. 1(b) [8]. For phenomenon (3), it is consistent with the extracted interface trap density (Dit) for devices without irra-diation, with 300 krad and 10 Mrad irradiation, which are 2.2×Dit value is extracted from the C-V curves and the improved 1011, 1.2 × 1011and 0.9 × 1011eV−1cm−2respectively. The Dit after irradiation is due to the passivation of the Si surface dangling bonds and a decreased number of recombination centers at the HZO/Si interface [9]. In addition, the memory window (MW) for non-irradiated devices is 1.48 V which does not degrade with irradiation which is contrary to that reported for irradiated SBT [2]. In fact, the MW degradation is highly dependent on the extent of charge trapping effect. Typically thicker oxide is more vulnerable to charge trapping and thus SBT of 300 nm shows much worse charge trapping effect than this work where HZO of 12 nm is used.Besides the MW test, reliability issues which are the impor-tant concerns for practical applications are discussed. For endurance test, a course of continuous +5.5/−5 V pulse with pulse width of 10 μs was applied to the gate up to 106cycles. The cycling condition exceeds the minimum requirement for dipole switching and the relatively long pulse width is adopted to make the test more stringent. Fig. 2(a) shows the dependence of IG-VG characteristics on cycling numbers for device with different radiation doses. For non-irradiated device, the pristine curve reveals a current peak which corre-sponds to dipole switching and again confirms the ferroelec-tricity of the HZO film. As the cycling number increases, the peak position shifts with amplitude increase, suggesting that wake-up effect occurs which is expected to be mitigated by employing interfacial plasma treatment [10]. Similar trend is also observed for irradiated devices. However, it can be found that the switching current peak at the pristine state is reduced for irradiated devices and the current reduction becomes more pronounced as the radiation dose increases. By using Positive-Up-Negative-Down (PUND) method to eliminate the leakage component, the intrinsic Pr can be achieved and the",726

An obvious Pr increase with cycling number is shown for devices with different radiation doses and it reaches a relatively stable state at 105cycles that is known as wake-up effect. Even though all the domain walls are depinned at the stable state, irradiated devices still exhibit smaller Pr than that of non-irradiated devices. It is generally perceived that electron-hole pairs are generated along with chemical bond break in the oxide film during ionizing radiation and some of the broken bonds would give rise to defects such1372 IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS, VOL. 40, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2019Fig. 3.

(b) Evolution of ID-VG with cycling number for FeFETs with 300 krad radiation dose.as oxygen vacancies (Vo) which then serve as trap sites for carriers. It is the radiation-induced Vo that lead to substantial Pr reduction for devices with radiation [11]. Another possible reason for the degraded Pr after radiation may be the structure change. As the x-ray diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 3, the peak at 30.5◦is used to discern ferroelectric orthorhombic (o) phase in HfO2 system. As the radiation doses increases to 10 Mrad, the peak of o-phase shifts 0.19◦toward higher 2θ value, suggesting that high energy radiation could induce lattice distortion and degrade the ferroelectricity. Note that the MW of FeFET memory is determined by coercive field (EC) and the thickness of the ferroelectric film rather than Pr [12], and therefore irradiated devices with degraded Pr still display comparable MW.Fig. 4(a) shows the dependence ofVTH (VTH difference between both states) on cycling number for devices with various radiation doses. Non-irradiated devices reveal quite stable MW up to 106cycles. On the other hand, devices with 300 krad radiation show significant MW closure with cycling and the MW degrades to 0.52 V at the cycling number of 106. The evolution of ID-VGS with cycling number for devices with 300 krad radiation are shown in Fig. 4(b). The asymmetric VTH shift (different behavior for forward and reverse sweeping) with cycling number can be illustrated by the band diagram for both gate pulse polarities. For the band diagram for +5.5 V pulse shown in Fig. 5(a), electrons are injected from p-type substrate. However, the number of electrons (minority carriers) available for injection is not high enough in p-type substrate and thus the electron trapping effect in HZO is insignificant (VTH unchanged), even though radiation induces a certain amount of defects in the HZO. On the other hand, for the band diagram for -5 V pulse shown in Fig. 5(b), holes (majority carriers) are injected from p-type substrate and then get trapped in HZO. The amount of trapped holes increases for irradiated devices since more defects (traps) are generated during irradiation. At the same time, back tunneling of electrons in HZO also occurs. Both electrons and holes movement make the negative shift (VTH decrease). Note that the interfacial layer (IL) between HZO and Si substrateFig. 5. Energy band diagram for (a) positive and (b) negative gate bias.Fig. 6. Room-temperature retention performance in terms of ID mea-sured at VD = 0.08 V and VG = 0 V for FeFETs with various radiation doses.is caused by the reaction during thermal treatment which is physically confirmed as SiOx film of 1.1 nm. To mitigate the cycling-induced VTH degradation for irradiated devices, enhancing the bonding strength of interfacial layer and HZO is a prerequisite which may be achieved by incorporating N atoms [10] or high-pressure hydrogen annealing process [13]. Fig. 6 shows the retention performance for devices with different radiation doses. The retention was measured at 25◦C by reading drain current at VG = 0 V for both high and low VTH states. The",936
Chen_et_al-2019-IEEE_Electron_Device_Letters_Ionizing Radiation Effect on Memory Characteristics for HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Field Effect Transistors.docx,results,"indicate that both high (low VTH) and low current (high VTH) states keep stable with retention time up to 104sec for all types of devices. The 10-year extrapolated current ratio of 2.2 × 103and 1.2 × 103are obtained for devices with 300 krad and 10 Mrad respectively. Typically retention degrades by depolarization field (Edep) for fast decay component and gate leakage for long-term component. Since the EC for HZO is so high that the adverse effect of Edep is not significant [14]. Leakage caused by electrons injection from both gate electrode and substrate due to the attraction by dipole polarization plays a more critical role in determining retention characteristics. Because irradiated devices possess a lower Pr, a smaller amount of electrons are injected and thus charge trapping is less pronounced, leading to relatively stable retention performance.IV.",183

Miko_NaMLab_DRC_2019.docx,Introduction,"Ferroelectricity is very attractive for nonvolatile memories since it allows non-volatility paired with a field driven switching mechanism enabling a very low-power write operation. Non-volatile memories based on ferroelectric lead-zirconium-titanate (PZT) (see fig. 1a) are available on the market for more than a quarter of a century now [1]. Yet they are limited to niche applications due to the compatibility issues of the ferroelectric material with CMOS processes and the associated limited scalability [2]. The discovery of ferroelectricity in doped hafnium oxide has revived the activities towards a variety of scalable ferroelectric nonvolatile memory devices [3].Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Under certain processing conditions a non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase can be stabilized in hafnium oxide thin films [4]. In such a crystal structure, the oxygen ions can switch between two stable positions. The schematic of a unit cell of an orthorhombic hafnium oxide is shown in fig. 1b in comparison to the unit cell of a perovskite like PZT (fig. 1a) were the cation on the B lattice site of the ABO3 structure is assumed to be responsible for ferroelectric switching. Advancements in Ferroelectric Memory Cell Concepts There are three different ways to read out the ferroelectric polarization and construct a memory cell (fig.2). First the charge switched during the polarization switching in a capacitor can be directly detected which leads to the classical ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM, see fig. 2a) [5]. Second, the ferroelectric can be integrated into the gate stack of a MOS transistor leading to a ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET, see fig. 2b) [5]. Finally, in very thin ferroelectric layers that allow tunneling, the magnitude of the tunneling current depends on the polarization direction leading to a ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ, see fig. 2c) [6]. In the capacitor based FeRAM, the material properties of the ferroelectric are directly reflected. The coercive field of hafnium oxide based ferroelectrics is in the region of 1-2MV/cm leading to a high electrical field stress during endurance cycling and degradation of the ferroelectric. In particular oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in the optimization since they seem to support the stabilization of the orthorhombic phase [7] while at the same time they are detrimental for the endurance [8].FeFET devices have been successfully integrated into 28nm [9] and 22nm [10] technologies in the last years. The unavoidable interface oxide between the channel and the ferroelectric and the sensitivity of the MOSFET to any trapped charge makes cycling degradation even more severe [11]. Increasing the thickness of the ferroelectric layer helps to reduce the stress on the tunneling oxide during cycling [12]. A self-heating technique can be utilized to enhance cycling by annealing the cycling damage during device operation [13]. Furthermore, with an additional metal electrode the area ratio between the MOS capacitor and the ferroelectric capacitor can be optimized [11]. A basic limitation of the classical FeRAM cell shown in fig. 2a is the necessary capacitor area for stable sensing. 3D capacitors are necessary when scaling below 90nm [14]. When connecting the capacitor to the gate of a MOSFET, the amplification of the MOSFET can be utilized to drastically reduce the necessary capacitor area. However, a second transistor is required to reset the potential on the internal node (see fig. 3a). Such a cell was recently fabricated using a 28nm technology were the gate capacitor of a FeFET was used as a storage capacitor.[15] (fig. 3b). Fig. 4 shows the measurement",825

MRSAdvances_DraftFinal_VM_TEL2018.docx,ABSTRACT,"The recent discovery of ferroelectric behavior in doped hafnia-based dielectrics, attributed to a non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase, has potential for use in attractive applications such as negative differential capacitance field-effect-transistors (NCFET) and ferroelectric random access memory devices (FeRAM). Alloying with similar oxides like ZrO2, doping with specific elements such as Si, novel processing methods, encapsulation and annealing schemes are also some of the techniques that are being explored to target structural modifications and stabilization of the non-centrosymmetric phase. In this study, we utilized synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction in the grazing incidence in plane geometry (GIIXRD) to determine the crystalline phases in hafnia-zirconia (HZO) compositional alloys deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Here we compare and contrast the structural phases and ferroelectric properties of mechanically confined HZO films in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) and metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures. Both MIM and MIS structures reveals a host of reflections due to non-monoclinic phases in the d-spacing region between 1.75Å to 4Å. The non-monoclinic phases are believed to consist of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. Compared to the MIS structures a suppression of the monoclinic phase in MIM structures with 50% zirconia or less was observed. The correlation of the electrical properties with the structural analysis obtained by GIIXRD highlights the importance of understanding the effects of the underlying substrate (metal vs. Si) for different target applications.Email: vmukundan@sunypoly.edu",383
MRSAdvances_DraftFinal_VM_TEL2018.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide was discovered in 2011 in thin films doped with SiO2 and aided by TiN encapsulation [1,2]. Since then, hafnia with different doping elements and alloying with similar oxides have been under investigation for applications in ferroelectric RAM and negative differential capacitance FETs [3,4]. Further, electric field controlled partial polarization switching in ferroelectric FETs made from hafnia zirconia (HZO) films makes these an interesting candidate for synaptic memory devices for application in neuromorphic computing [4, 5]. At the core of these new-generation technologies is an ALD grown HZO nanoscale film which exhibits ferroelectricity when stabilized in a non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic structure [6]. Hafnia based ferroelectric materials are advantageous over perovskites due to their CMOS compatibility, higher bandgap and scalability. Understanding the details of effect of structural phases on the electrical properties of these materials is extremely important for device engineering for different applications. Ferroelectricity in hafnia can be observed in ultra-thin films, even in the range of 2 to 10nm [1, 7]. In the bulk form, the most stable phase of hafnia is monoclinic structure (P21/c; m-phase) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. At higher temperature (1700°C and 2600°C), hafnia transforms into tetragonal phase (P42/nmc; t-phase) and cubic phase (Fm3m; c-phase) [8]. With hydrostatic compressive pressure, m-phase can be transformed to centro-symmetric orthorhombic phase (o-phase) such as Pbca and Pnma [9]. Böscke et al.[1] attributed the ferroelectricity to the formation of a polar orthorhombic phase. Sang et al. [10] used detailed transmission electron microscopy to examine the symmetry of HfO2 and confirmed Pca21 leads to ferroelectricity in Gd doped hafnia thin films. While there are many factors that help in stabilizing different structural phases, we are particularly interested in investigating alloying and underlying substrate effects. Alloying hafnia with zirconia enables high polarization values for a wide range of composition ratios not seen with various dopants [11]. Here we study the substrate effect on structural and electrical behavior of hafnia-zirconia ultra-thin films. From the ferroelectric device perspective, it is important to optimize the process and improve the endurance and remnant polarization of both metal-insulator-metal (MIM) and metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitor stacks. In our study, we focused on TiN as a metal electrode in MIM and MIS and silicon as the semiconductor in MIS. Further, the electrical and structural properties can be altered by processing conditions [6,12] electrical cycling [13], annealing temperature [6] and types of electrodes [14]. We recently reported ferroelectric behavior in ALD grown HZO films of thickness in the range 7-10nm in MIS stacks with a post-metal anneal [15]. In this previous study, HZO films showed a wide range of electrical properties depending on the ratio of Hf:Zr, transitioning from a linear dielectric for 30% zirconia to a ferroelectric for 80% zirconia.",753
MRSAdvances_DraftFinal_VM_TEL2018.docx,EXPERIMENT,"AL DETAILSThe dielectric films of 7nm thick Hf1-xZrxO2 (x = 0-1) were deposited using a thermal ALD process in a 300mm TEL TriasTM cleanroom tool. The zirconia content was modulated by carefully controlling the cycle ratio of the Hf and Zr precursors. H2O was used as the oxidizer. ALD TiN was used as the electrode material. Both blanket and patterned samples of MIM capacitors were fabricated. Electrical measurements were performed on MIM capacitors while blanket MIM films were prepared for physical analysis. All samples in this study were subject to post metallization (after the top TiN electrode) anneal in N2 ambient at 450°C for 5 minutes. Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction was done at G2 beamline at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) making use of the high synchrotron photon flux. The x-ray beam was in the range of 10.8 -11.3 keV and was incident at 0.5°. The angle of the Soller slits was 0.1° deg. A series of Ω-2ν scans were acquired at different values of tilt of the detectors. The data is collected as grazing incidence reciprocal space maps (GI-RSM) and are converted to grazing incidence d-space maps (GI-DSM) using python codes [15]. Collected GIIXRD spectra were compared to standard reference patterns for monoclinic, tetragonal and orthorhombic structures of HfO2 and ZrO2 from the Standard Joint Committee for Powder Diffraction Spectra (JCPDS) [16-22]. Due to the high stabilization temperature of the cubic phase (~2600°C) [23], the presence of the tetragonal phase is considered to be more likely than cubic phase from the thermodynamic standpoint. There are three different isomorphs of orthorhombic structures that are considered in this study [1, 10, 16, 18, 19]. The TiN layer is observed to exhibit the cubic phase [22]. The MIM sample stacks were patterned to 100x100µm2 for the electrical characterization. The device pads were created via a single lithography step followed by a reactive ion-etch process to remove the top electrode and HZO layer in the field. The electrical characterization was performed via a pulsed based current-voltage (I-V) measurement with a post processing analysis to obtain the polarization properties. To study the ferroelectric response of the samples, polarization measurements involving pulsed switching measurements were performed. A semiconductor analyzer with a waveform generator and fast measurement unit was deployed to apply pulses in the microsecond regime and measure the corresponding current response. The voltage was applied and measured at the TiN top contact and the ground contact served as the measurement point for the current. The ground contact was made to the silicon wafer which is in direct contact to the TiN bottom electrode of the sample stack. The polarization was extracted from the current response in the positive-up negative-down (PUND) measurement scheme as illustrated in Figure 1. The polarization current can be extracted via subtraction of the second from the first pulse and integration over the pulse timing yields the polarization charge. With this relation, the polarization-voltage (P-V) relationship can be plotted. From those plots, the remnant polarization can be extracted at the intersection of the positive and negative polarization (Pr+ and Pr-) with the y -axis. FIGURE 1: Current-Voltage (I-V) example curve. The measurement scheme known as PUND was deployed to extract the polarization. The first 2 pulses are preset pulses to set the polarization to defined level. The following two yield the Pr- component while the second two yield the Pr+ component of the sample stack polarization.",835
MRSAdvances_DraftFinal_VM_TEL2018.docx,DISCUSSION,"In this study, we have performed GIIXRD measurements for ultra-thin HZO films of 5 different compositions. For studying the substrate effect, we have compared and summarized the GIIXRD data for both MIM and MIS in Figure 2. Pure hafnia exhibits both monoclinic and non-monoclinic features. This is witnessed by three peaks between 2.75A and 3.25A. Pure zirconia displays a pure tetragonal structure. For the samples with 50% zirconia or less we see a marked difference in the aforementioned three peaks indicating differences in relative monoclinic phase amount (figure 2(A-C). There are clear differences in the peak ratio of the main monoclinic peaks (2.86Å and 3.14Å) with the main non-monoclinic peak (2.96Å). We compare the intensity ratios of the peaks for roughly calculating the monoclinic phase and non-monoclinic phase content. The percent values of monoclinic vs. non-monoclinic are tabulated here in Fig 2(F). From these values an increase in the non-monoclinic phase % for MIM vs MIS for 50% zirconia or less is shown. For pure zirconia and 80% zirconia stacks, we do not see any difference in the structural phases between MIM and MIS stack as seen in figure 2(D) and 2(E). This data indicates the substrate plays an increasing role in phase stabilization as the relative amount of hafnia in the mixed films is increased.FIGURE 2: Summary of the GIIXD comparison data of MIM and MIS samples of the same compositions.

Polarization-voltage behavior in MIM structures was also observed to vary significantly between the sample stacks with different compositions. Starting with pure HfO2, the remnant polarization extracted from the PUND measurement is ~0.04 µC/cm2 with a 3 V peak voltage. This is a significant deviation from the expected non-ferroelectric behavior of un-doped HfO2. A significant increase in polarization can be observed in Hf0.7Zr0.3O2 and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 with a wide opening of the hysteresis curve (Figure 3(E) and 3(D)) and an extracted remnant polarization of 0.7 µC/cm2 with a 2 V peak voltage and 14 µC/cm2 with a 3 V peak voltage, respectively.

While Hf0.2Zr0.8O2 seems to have some small ferroelectric component, the pure ZrO2 film is fully anti-ferroelectric in its P-V behavior.It has been well-established that the ferroelectric behavior in hafnia-based dielectrics is attributed to the non-centrosymmetric polar orthorhombic structure, Pca21 [1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12-15]. While there are two other orthorhombic phases monitored in these materials, they are not polar and do not lead to ferroelectricity. Huan et al [24] also reported calculated values of polarization for hafnia with this orthorhombic structure, further establishing the existence of this particular orthorhombic phase for ferroelectric behavior. However, the theoretical polarization values have not been realized due to the presence of other structural phases. Further, it has been clearly established by theory and",230
MRSAdvances_DraftFinal_VM_TEL2018.docx,experiment,"s that there is a phase transition from monoclinic to orthorhombic phase to tetragonal phase in both hafnia and zirconia. We also see a strong ferroelectric behavior in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 and Hf0.7Zr0.3O2. Muller et al [25] reported similar polarization values for the HZO with 50% zirconia in 7-9nm HZO samples. From figure 3 it is clearly shown that ferroelectricity emerges at 30% zirconia and becomes stronger at 50% zirconia while anti-ferroelectricity appears for higher zirconia content in these stacks. We are also reporting the difference in the polarization behavior of MIM here and that of MIS. The important difference is noted for 80% zirconia stacks. From figure 3(C), MIM stack shows an anti-ferroelectric behavior while the corresponding MIS stack shows ferroelectricity as earlier reported [15]. It is believed that this behavior has a strong structural correlation. Similar MIM behavior was reported by Muller et al. and a composition and temperature dependent ferroelectric phase transition was reported in hafnia-zirconia solid solution [26]. Theoretical calculations by Reyes-Lillo et al [27] have shown the tetragonal phase shows anti-ferroelectric behavior in zirconia as it is energetically preferred. The difference in electrical behavior of the 80% zirconia HZO layer in MIS vs MIM can clearly be attributed to the different substrate and differences in applied stress from the bottom TiN electrode vs. semiconductor substrate may play a role in this difference in phase stabilization. Further investigation of HZO layer of similar compositions deposited with other semiconductor substrates such as Ge and different bottom electrodes would be useful to help understand the effect of substrates and bottom electrode on the structure and electrical properties of these materials.",417
MRSAdvances_DraftFinal_VM_TEL2018.docx,CONCLUSION,"S/SUMMARYWe investigated the structural and electrical properties of hafnia-zirconia ALD deposited layers by synchrotron based grazing incidence in-place x-ray diffraction and PUND measurements. These dielectric materials with 5 different compositions with 7nm thickness with two types of stacking (MIM and MIS) were explored. Compared to the MIS structures a suppression of the monoclinic phase in MIM structures with 50% zirconia or less was observed. In MIM stacks, pure hafnia exhibited ferroelectric behavior while pure zirconia exhibited anti-ferroelectric behavior. Similar behavior was seen in films with higher hafnia and zirconia content as well. In the case of 80% zirconia layers, MIM stacks showed anti-ferroelectric behavior and the corresponding MIS stacks showed ferroelectric behavior. Ferroelectric behavior was witnessed for 50% zirconia ultra-thin films as MIM stacks as well. Future research focusing on substrates and bottom electrode layer is required to delineate their exact effect and tailor these dielectrics for different applications.

Toriumi_shibayama_FE_ZrO2_EDTM_2018.docx,results,are showing a considerable difference between ZrO2 and HfO2 in terms of the stability against thermal annealing process. It is inferred that this is likely to be originated from the activation energy difference in the structural phase transitions from tetragonal to orthorhombic and subsequent orthorhombic to monoclinic phase transitions. (,76
Toriumi_shibayama_FE_ZrO2_EDTM_2018.docx,Introduction,"It was recently reported that HfO2 ferroelectric (FE) properties was achieved by forming the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic structure, Pca21 [1, 2]. In addition, it was found that HfO2 had a universal kinetic pathway for the phase transition; cubic (c)/ tetragonal (t)  orthorhombic (o)  monoclinic (m) [3]. This phase transition can be controlled by a deformation factor in the structural phase transition. On the other hand, Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 has often been studied as a ferroelectric film because of its broad concentration sensitivity [4]. Moreover, it has been recently reported that non-doped ZrO2 also exhibits FE properties in some conditions, in addition to the fact that it usually indicates anti-ferroelectric (AFE) properties [5-8]. A recent theoretical calculation discusses that AFE hysteresis in ZrO2 is caused by the electric field induced phase transition from tetragonal to non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase (Pca21) [5].",254
Toriumi_shibayama_FE_ZrO2_EDTM_2018.docx,Experiment,"ally, it was reported that FE ZrO2 was formed by a stress from the substrate [6, 7]. TiN/MgO(001) or Pt substrates were used for inducing the stress. Another paper reported ~190-nm-thick FE ZrO2, which was formed by the chemical solution deposition method, by focusing on the piezo-electric application [8]. ZrO2 has similar physical properties with HfO2 in terms of ionic radii, electron negativity, and crystalline phases. To elucidate those Zr-related issues, it is needed to understand structural properties in conjunction with FE properties of ZrO2 by p+-Ge(001) substrate was used as the backside metal because it was reported that p+-Ge backside metal gave a good interface properties compared to other metals [9]. After conventional chemical cleaning of p+-Ge(001) substrate, ~30-nm-thick non-doped ZrO2 were deposited by rf-sputtering at several deposition temperatures (Tdepo). Subsequently, the post-deposition annealing (PDA) at 400–600°C for 30 s in N2 ambient was carried out. Finally, Au was deposited as a top gate. Doped ZrO2 was deposited by rf-co-sputtering, also at room temperature (RT). The crystalline structure was characterized by the grazing angle out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. Both FE and AFE properties were characterized by polarization-electrical field (P-E) measurements at 100 kHz.",350
Toriumi_shibayama_FE_ZrO2_EDTM_2018.docx,discussion,"~Stability of tetragonal phase ZrO2~ First, we focus on the effects of annealing and doping on phase transition from c/t to m phase for ZrO2 films deposited at RT, because they are key parameters in FE HfO2 formation. Figure 1 shows PDA temperature dependence of (a) out-of-plane XRD patterns and (b) P-E curves. The crystalline structures of ZrO2 films annealed at 400–600°C are all highly symmetric phases with no monoclinic phase. Here, highly symmetric (h) phase denotes the phase including cubic, tetragonal and orthorhombic ones, because they are not distinguishable from each other. Fig. 1 (b) shows that AFE hysteresis is more clearly observed by increasing the PDA temperature from 400 to 600°C. Considering AFE property of ZrO2 film is achieved in the tetragonal, the",209

Furthermore, although high temperature XRD measurements were carried out, no monoclinic phase was observed up to 600°C (not shown). This fact indicates that the tetragonal phase in ZrO2 is thermally quite stable comparing with HfO2, as expected thermodynamically. Next the doping effect in ZrO2 is discussed. Since we already demonstrated that Nb5+ doping 116 978-1-5386-3712-8/18/$31.00 ©2018 IEEE 2018 IEEE Electron Devices Technology and Manufacturing Conference Proceedings of Technical Papersstrongly induced the monoclinic phase in HfO2 [3], temperature. Nb was also introduced into ZrO2. Figure 2 shows (a) out-of-plane XRD patterns and (b) P-E curves, of Nb-doped ZrO2. Interestingly, m phase is observed, though very slightly and AFE-hysteresis is broadened, in only 2.26 at.% Nb doped ZrO2. A large amount of Nb doping (9.96 at.%) suppresses the crystallization ZrO2. This tendency is substantially different from Figure 3 shows the out-of-plane XRD pattern of ZrO2 films deposited at 300, 400, and 500°C, respectively. Both",326

This fact indicates that the activation energy of ZrO2 from t to m phase (Etm) is much larger than that of HfO2. ~Ferroelectric orthorhombic nucleation ~ The sputtering deposition at a low temperature generally leads to a non-equilibrium phase, which is the tetragonal phase in the case of ZrO2.

In previous studies, upper TiN capping layers were reported to strongly affect the evolution of polymorphism of doped HfO2 thin films.5,9 Mueller et al. suggested that the TiN capping layer prevents the shear strain which induces the phase transformation from the t- to m-phase during cooling.9It was also suggested that the upper TiN capping layer prevents the surface diffusion, and the subsequent grain growth and accompanying transform-ation to the m-phase can be suppressed.27Toriumi et al. exam-ined the effect of the Si upper capping layer on the kinetics of the phase transition from a metastable tetragonal or cubic phase to the monoclinic phase.58They reported that the Si upper capping layer significantly increased the activationThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017View Article Online Nanoscale Paperenergy for a monoclinic phase formation, so the Si capping layer could kinetically suppress the monoclinic phase for-mation.58Based on the aforementioned reports, it is believed that the TiN capping layer is also expected to affect the kinetic energy barrier for the monoclinic phase formation.

According to the thermodynamic data at 773 K the phase dis-tribution under each condition can be calculated. Accordingly, the films are expected to be composed of mostly m- and t-phases at 773 K. During cooling down, relatively large t-phase grains can (partially) transform to the o- or m-phase, whereas sufficiently small grains still exist in t-phase even at 300 K. The critical grain radius range for such phase transitions can be calculated based on the surface energy model. However, the TiN capping can suppress the transformation from the t-phase to the m-phase. Therefore, the fraction of grains that are sup-posed to be in the m-phase are now assumed to be in the o-phase.

For this purpose, first the grain size must be determined. Fortunately this can be accomplished using the detailed XRD pattern.From Fig. 4f, the degrees of crystallization of the 9.2 nm-thick Hf0.57Zr0.43O2 and Hf0.30Zr0.70O2 films were 11 and 23%, and the values for 19.2 nm-thick films were 84 and 88%, respectively. Therefore, the 9.2 nm-thick films were considered to be partially crystalline films, and their GIXRD patterns were used to analyse the crystallization process. For the as-deposited 9.2 nm-thick Hf0.57Zr0.43O2, Hf0.30Zr0.70O2, and ZrO2 films, weak and broad o111/t101 peaks can be observed in Fig. 4c–e. The broadening of the diffraction peaks can be related to the small size of the crystallites, and the Scherrer equation can be used to estimate the crystallite size.61To pre-cisely estimate the peak broadening effect from small crystal-lites, the broadening from other factors needs to be excluded. For this purpose, the broadening of a diffraction peak of single crystalline MgO and Si substrates was measured, and the broadening of the substrate peak (the full width at halfNanoscale, 2017, 9, 9973–9986 | 9981View Article Online Paper Nanoscalemaximum, FWHM, is 0.07°) turned out to be less than 5%, compared to that of the o111/t101 diffraction peak of HZO (x = 0.43, 0.70, and 1.00) films with a FWHM in the range of 1.8 to 2.4°. Thus, the broadening from other effects than the size can be ignored. By applying the Scherrer equation, the crystallitepresent in the as-deposited film retain their crystalline struc-ture after the PMA and, furthermore, play the role of a hetero-geneous nucleation site for the subsequent crystallization of the remaining amorphous material during the PMA.

This might be due to the large bulk freeenergy difference between the o- and t-phases that has to beovercome solely by the interface energy effect.

By examining the quantity A fromthe second order term of the free energy, the exactFerroelectric thin films are intensively studied because of their promising applications in memories devices.1)In thin films, a surface modified layer may develop at the surface and has a crucial influence on phase transitions in ferro-electric films. Many studies have found that the physical properties of ferroelectric thin films are quite different from that of bulk materials and significantly depend on the surface conditions of films.2,3)With an increasing trend towards greater miniaturization, surface and interface become an increasingly important factor in functioning of devices. Thus, from the applications point of view, understanding of the intrinsic effects of surface is crucial as they control the characteristics of the films, e.g. polarization reversal and dielectric properties.Since the Landau–Devonshire (LD) theory gives a very good account for much of the data on bulk ferroelectrics, it is natural that extensions to films should be sought. One approach has been to apply the Landau–Ginzburg (LG) free energy to account for the intrinsic surface effect by theexpressions for determining the critical thickness of a ferroelectric thin film has been discussed as a function of temperature, film thickness and other physical parameters for symmetric and asymmetric surface conditions.In this article, we extend the previous study11)by deriving the effective LD-type free energy up to fourth order terms.

Meanwhile, performance under harsh conditions (such as hightemperature and high total ionized dose (TID) radiation) is highly demandeddue to the growing applications for nonvolatile memory. Here, we integrate highly scalable ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films on potential flexible mica substrates using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to form flexible MFMcapacitors and investigate the ferroelectric properties, the retention behaviors, and endurance characteristics of the TaN/HZO/TaN/mica flexible MFMcapacitors under various tensile and compressive bending radii. In addition, these characteristics of the HZO-based MFM flexible capacitors are explored in a wide temperature range from 25 up to 125 °C. The ferroelectricity of the film can be retained under a bending radius down to 7.5 mm after 1000 bending cycles, and the retention properties can be reserved under a bake time of 104s at 125 °C, with an extrapolated retention time-to-failure longer than 10 years. Furthermore, the flexible devices display robust ferroelectric performance against radiation of60Co γ-rays with a total dose of 1 Mrad (Si).

fukuyama.docx,Introduction,"11.1 Background of this study Recently, LSI used various products such as personal computer, cellular phone and mobile devices etc. It is required more and more high speed and low power consumption. These products and requirements are realized by the progresses of silicon LSI technology that are high density, high integration and so on. The performance of LSI technology depends on the characteristics of metal-insulator-semiconductor field effect transistor (MISFET), MIS capacitor and metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor. As the minimizing physical size of the devices, more and more possible to integrate transistors and capacitors and integration of various functions were attained and developed. As possible to attain various functions, it is expected that the importance for RF and DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) devices will increase in the future, more and more. So, not only transistors but also MIM capacitors are important devices. But SiO2-based transistor used LSI devices has serious problem such as increasing of the power consumption by increasing leakage current of devices caused tunneling current for thin film. In capacitors, the needed capacitance do not keep for more and more integration. More and more integrated, improved increasing leakage current is important factor for LSI devices and products. High-k material is one of the improved this problem – High-k materials have a high relative dielectric constant. So, film thickness will be possible to thick to reduce direct tunneling current. Famous devices to use MIM capacitor is DRAM. High capacitance density with good electrical and physical characteristics MIM capacitor is importance for the future MIM application. Since MIM capacitor have high capacitance density, cell area of DRAM capacitor will be reduced and easily integration more and more. Recently, many mobile devices used DRAM capacitor and increase DRAM capacitor amount and using 2devices more and more. RF device is also important device and will increase to use more and more for the future. So, MIM capacitors that used to DRAM and RF are very important devices and need to develop devices for our useful and happy life.

For that purpose, the thicknesses of gate and capacitor insulator have been thinner. Up to the present, SiO2, SiON and Si3N4 have been used gate insulator and capacitor. Because SiO2, SiON and Si3N4 have a good property such as very low fixed charge density and high thermal stability on Si substrate, especially. According to International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductor (ITRS), in the future, the gate dielectric oxide will become a few atoms in thickness because of this continuous shrinking for MIS transistor and a higher capacitance density and lower leakage current will be required for capacitor [1]. However, if the dielectric oxide is too thin, then the gate tunneling leakage current exponentially increase and this effect brings about serious problems to operate the devices. In the case of thick insulator, that works as barrier for tunneling carriers. However, in the case of thin insulator less than about 1 nm, the carriers directly pass through the insulator owing to quantum effect. Consequently, the leakage current increase exponentially. This phenomenon will cause increasing of power consumption and degradation of LSI reliability. As one of the solutions for overcoming the limits of SiO2 dielectric as described in before, high-k materials have been attached much attention. High-k material has high relative dielectric constant. The capacitance Ci is expressed as following. C=ε εS (Eq.1-1) i 0 it 4Here, ε0 and εi are vacuum dielectric constant (8.855x10-14 F/cm) and relative dielectric constant (ex. SiO2 is 3.9), S is electrode area, t is thickness of film. As a method of maintaining enough capacitance value with shrinking of gate area, the physical thickness of insulator has been thinned conventionally. However, the phenomenon of direct tunneling leakage current effect by the limit of thinning physical thickness will be serious problem. Therefore, any other new schemes have been required to maintain capacitance density with the shrinking device. As one of the breakthrough ways, there is the way using high-k material instead of conventional SiO2, SiON and Si3N4. This way make possible to increase insulator thickness with maintaining capacitance density. The band diagrams of high-k material case and SiO2 are shown in Figure 1-2. The arrows represent flow of carrier. As this figure, direct tunneling leakage current can be suppressed by increasing insulator thickness owing to using high-k material. electronEcelectronEcEcSiO2EvEcHigh-kEvEvEvFig.1-2 Band diagrams of high-k material and SiO2 5 ITRS requires the replacement of SiO2 gate dielectric and MIM capacitor films with high-k materials immediately. The requirement for high-k materials are high relative dielectric constant, low leakage current density, chemical thermodynamic stability on Si, heat stability, small interface state density and fixed charge, high mobility and high reliability. Recently, in order to overcome the limits of SiO2, SiON and Si3N4, several promising materials have been investigated by a large number of researchers. Under these restricted conditions, metal oxides like Al2O3, ZrO2, HfO2 and rare earth oxides have been studied eagerly for the next generation gate dielectric materials because they have high relative dielectric constants and wide bandgap [29-31].

fukuyama.docx,Conclusion,"of this study Pt/La2O3/Pt MIM capacitor was deposited by e-beam evaporation. Deposition temperature is room temperature. Heating at 250oC in deposition process, electrical characteristics were not obtained. Annealing gases are N2, O2 and forming gas. Annealing temperature and time are 300oC and 500oC at 10 minutes. As same thickness of as deposition condition, La2O3 film thickness was changed different thickness for annealing gas and temperature. Three annealing conditions used, only PDA, only PMA and PDA and PMA. With only PDA, high capacitance density was obtained higher than with only PMA condition. It is thought that thickness of with only PDA condition is thinner than only PMA condition. With PDA and PMA, capacitance density is as same as or less than PDA. With PDA and PMA is the best annealing condition to obtain good characteristics such as low leakage current, high capacitance density and small linear VCC β. With PDA and PMA condition, leakage current is one order lower than with only PDA or PMA condition. It is thought that interface between Pt electrode and La2O3 film is more stability than with only PDA or PMA condition. This is also thought from linear VCC value β. The β value with only PDA or PMA conditions are very large and with PDA and PMA condition is very small. Small β value means to obtain near the same capacitance density in the same positive and negative bias voltages were applied. But it is expected that characteristics of only PMA condition is obtained same characteristics with PDA and PMA condition. However, characteristics between with only PMA and with PDA and PMA were different. Since La2O3 film became densification with annealing, I considered that only PMA condition not only made stability but also formed defect in La2O3 film or Pt-La2O3 interface at the same time. In the",424
fukuyama.docx,results,", PDA and PMA needed to obtain stability interface and good characteristics 74for Pt/La2O3/Pt MIM capacitor. However, Pt is known as stability metal in general, so difficult to form interfacial layer with many annealing condition. In other metal such as formed interfacial layer with annealing, with PDA and PMA may be not the best annealing condition. Annealing temperature is increased from 300oC to 500oC, trap site increased from conduction mechanism characteristics. But in Pt/La2O3/Pt MIM capacitor, it is enough stability with 500oC heating process if interface between La2O3 and metal (or Si) is stability. To improve substrate surface roughness, good characteristics were obtained. So, substrate roughness is important factor to obtain good characteristics of MIM capacitor. For Pt/La2O3/Pt MIM capacitor, process conditions were depended on electrical characteristics strongly. Flat substrate surface and with PDA and PMA need to obtain good stability and electrical characteristics. At low annealing temperature condition is more stability than at high annealing temperature. However, at high annealing temperature condition is obtained high capacitance density and low leakage current under low bias voltage region. Annealing temperature condition is decided to target characteristics such as needed high capacitance density, low leakage current etc. 754.2 Future Issues In this study, we obtained high capacitance density, low leakage current and small linear VCC β. On the other hand, quadratic VCC α value is as same as other high-k material. Many high-k materials have positive α value. But there is negative a value material such as SiO2. And to laminate positive α and negative α materials, small α is obtained [14]. Thus, to laminate SiO2 and La2O3, advantage of high relative dielectric constant is lost. Therefore, in the future, we need to research high relative dielectric constant and negative α value material. Substrate roughness effect is important factor to obtain good characteristics. Good surface substrate and high work function value metals also need to the future MIM capacitors. 76",482

For �1 � �1c, the polarization at the interface of the layer 2 is only slightly enhanced with increasing interfacial coupling strength.. Upon increasing the coupling strength [see the bottom figure of Fig.. 2(a)], the polarizations at the interface of the structure are suppressed and a P6-type kink (domain wall) is found to appear in layer 1..

Effects_of_High-Pressure_Annealing_on_the_Low-Frequency_Noise_Characteristics_in_Ferroelectric_FET.docx,Abstract,"— In this work, the low-frequency noise (LFN) characteristics of hafnium-zirconium oxide (HZO) ferro-electric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) with and without high-pressure forming gas annealing (HPA) treatment are investigated. The origin of 1/f noise in the FeFET without HPA is changed from carrier number fluctuation to Hooge’s mobility fluctuation after wake-up due to the remote phonon scattering from the polarized HZO. Also, Hooge’s parameter is increased by the program/erase (P/E) cycling-induced stress. On the contrary, only the correlated mobility fluc-tuation is increased after the wake-up in the FeFET with HPA. Furthermore, the LFN of the FeFET with HPA shows robustness to P/E cycling-inducedstress after the wake-up, showing superb endurance performance.Index Terms— Endurance, ferroelectric FET (FeFET), high-pressure annealing (HPA), low-frequency noise (LFN), wake-up.I.",248

Recently, it has been reported that high-pressure forming gas annealing (HPA) improves both the wake-up effect and endurance without sacrificing the mem-ory window of FeFETs [10]. Despite the importance of understanding the mechanism and physics of the wake-up effect, cycling endurance, and effect of HPA, those were only observed and explained by indirect methods, such as polarization-electric field and current-voltage curves [10].Various methods have been used to evaluate the reliability of FeFETs, including charge pumping technique [5], [6]. However, previous studies to characterize the reliability of FeFETs adopted the charge pumping technique that extracts the trap density at the channel-gate oxide interface (fast trap), making it impossible to investigate traps inside the gate oxide [6]. On the contrary, low-frequency noise (LFN) analysis reflects the dynamic trapping/detrapping process inside the gate oxide [11]–[15]. An applied frequency range in LFN measurement can monitor oxide trap density along the gate stacks. This allows to extract a depth profile of trap density and quantify its magnitude as well, making it possible to monitor the impact of HPA and program/erase (P/E) cycling-induced stress (wake-up and endurance) on ferroelectric mate-rials. As such, in this letter, we systematically investigate and compare the LFN characteristics of hafnium-zirconium oxide (HZO) FeFET depending on the device status and whether HPA is done or not.II.",845

Note that the HPA is conducted for 1 hour at 450◦C under forming gas (Ar 96 % and H2 4 %).Fig. 1(a) shows the transfer characteristics (ID-VGS) of the FeFETs with and without HPA. The FeFET with HPA shows the steeper subthreshold swing and larger drain current than those of the FeFET without HPA, which indicates the reduced effects of defect states. Also, the HPA causes a transition of HZO from tetragonal-phase to orthorhombic phase [16], increasing remanent polarization and thus memory window. In addition, after the HPA, wake-up-free behavior and the robustness against P/E cycling-induced memory windowFig. 2(b) and (c) show the SID/I2 Dand (gm/ID)2 versus ID of the pristine and after wake-up FeFETs without HPA, respectively. The SID/I2 Dis sampled at 10 Hz. In the pristine device, the SID/I2 Dand (gm/ID)2 show the same tendency with respect to change of ID, indicating that the 1/ f noise stems from the CNF referring to (1). However, after wake-up, the origin of 1/ f noise is changed to HMF (slope of−1 in Fig. 2(c)). After wake-up, the HZO is polarized, and thereby the mobility of the inversion channel is strongly affected by the remote phonon scattering induced by the HZO. It has been reported that soft bonds in highly polarizable materials are related to a low-energy optical phonon, and they induce additional carrier mobility scattering [19]. Therefore, the magnitude of 1/ f noise significantly increases after thedegradation are obtained (Fig. 1(b)). wake-up.For LFN measurement, the low noise current amplifier (SR570) and signal analyzer (35670A) are used.

The FeFETs show 1/ fγ (γ =−∂lnSI D/∂ln f ) noise behavior, which can be explained either by the carrier number fluctuation (CNF) [17] or Hooge’s mobility fluctuation (HMF) model [18]. The CNF model is represented as [17]:SI D= (gm2SV f b(1))I2 Dwhere gm is transconductance and SVfb is flat-band voltage noise. SVfb can be expressed asSV f b =q2kBT NT λ (2)where NT is volume trap density, λ is tunneling attenuation coefficient, Cox is gate oxide capacitance per unit area, and f is frequency. On the other hand, the HMF model is given as [18]:In Fig. 2(a), there is another important point: the difference of γ between the pristine and wake-up FeFETs. The γ contains information about the spatial distribution of traps in the SiO2 (dielectric: DE) and HZO (ferroelectric: FE). The frequency-domain of the power spectral density can be converted to the vertical distance from Si/SiO2 interface (z) by the following equation [20]:z = λ ln�2π f τ0�(4) 1where τ0 is the time for tunneling into a trap state at the interface (z = 0). Fig. 2(d) shows the spatial distribution of NT as a function of z in two independent samples. The NT is obtained at an ID of ∼200 nA.charges trapped in deep-level states near the interface between The dip observed at z ≈ 1.45 nm is caused by the immobileFE and DE, which do not contribute to the CNF [21]. Note that(FE/DE) interface, considering an inversion layer thickness z ≈ 1.45 nm is the location corresponding to the HZO/SiO2in Si is ∼5 Å and the DE thickness is ∼8–10 Å. It is also observed that the pristine HZO film, which is not fully polarized, does not cause serious scattering in Fig. 2(a). This can be verified by the γ value smaller than 1 (0.65), indicating that the NT decreases in the HZO region (z > 1.45 nm). An increase in γ (∼0.91) after the wake-up demonstrates that scattering sources in the HZO are activated. Also, the dip disappears after the wake-up (Fig. 2(a)). It seems that the increased remote phonon scattering makes the dip invisible.SI D I2 D=αHμef f 2kT(3)Note that there is no difference in 1/ f noise behavior betweenthe program (W0) and erase states (W1) after the wake-up inFig. 2(a), meaning that the effect of defects on LFN are notwhere αH is Hooge’s parameter.different in both W1 and W0 states.Authorized licensed use limited to: Georgia Institute of Technology.

For the FeFETs with HPA, there is no wake-up effect as aforementioned (Fig. 1(b)). The data from the FeFET with HPA after wake-up indicates that the data was obtained after applying the same bias stress for measuring the FeFET without HPA after wake-up. At an IDof 20 nA, the Dshows no difference before and after wake-up, whereas SID/I2 the γ and the magnitude of the 1/ f noise slightly increase after the wake-up at ID = ∼2 μA.

However, the SID/I2 same magnitude in the low ID region, while the SID/I2 Dafter the wake-up becomes larger than that of the pristine device in the high ID region. This can be explained as follows. The correlated mobility fluctuation (CMF) after the wake-up and the scattering related to CMF increase proportionally to the ID/gm, so it has a greater impact in the high ID region [22]. The",1282

Logic_Compatible_High-Performance_Ferroelectric_Transistor_Memory.docx,Abstract,"— Silicon channel ferroelectric field-effect tran-sistors (FeFETs) with low-k interfacial layer (IL) between ferroelectric and silicon channel suffers from high write voltage, limited write endurance and long read-after-write latency. This is due to early IL breakdown and mobile charge injection at the ferroelectric-IL interface. Here, we demon-strate low voltage, high speed memory operation with high write endurance using an IL-free back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible FeFET. We fabricated IL-free FeFETs with 28nm channellength (Lg) and 126nmwidth undera thermal budget <4000C by integrating 5nm Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) gate stack with amorphous Indium Tungsten Oxide (IWO) semicon-ductor channel. We report a voltage memory window of 1.6V with a read current window ILVT/IHVT of 105, write voltage of ±1.6V with 20ns pulses, instantaneousread-after-write latency <300ns and a record high write endurance exceeding 1011cycles.

Fig. 2(e) shows a full transient measurement performed to demonstrate the absence of read latency. Note that here we used a continuous VDS applied throughout the measurement and a fixed current compliance of 10μA. This in turn increases the noise floor and limits the minimum current that can be measured as opposed to Fig. 2(d). We performed multiple transient measurements, 20ns pulses. We demonstrate instantaneous read-after-write showing high speed and low voltage operation with ±1.6V and operation with a measured read latency <300ns (limited by the setup), which is orders of magnitude improvement over conventional Si FeFET.Next, we investigate the write endurance of the IL-free FeFET. Fig. 4(a) shows the bipolar pulse scheme with write pulses of ± 1.8V, 20ns with 100ns delay between the pulses. This is followed by periodic reading of the memory state using one-spot read-out scheme. Fig. 4(b) shows the dual-sweep DC Id-Vg of the FeFET pre- and post-1011cycling. We see an increase in the sub-threshold slope (SS) of the device post 1011endurance cycling. This can be associated with the generation of interface traps density (Nit) at the interface between HZO and IWO upon repeated switching ofFig. 4.

Similar effectshave been reported previously for Si FeFETs [7], [11]. How-ever, in contrast to rapid degradation and permanent failureexhibited by Si FeFETs after 104− 106cycles [3]–[7] due to catastrophic breakdown of the IL, we see a graceful degra-dation. Note the presence of anti-clockwise hysteresis postendurance cycling, denoting robust ferroelectricity in the 5nmHZO with no sudden breakdown. Figs. 4(c) and (d) show themeasured ILVT and IHVT and current window ILV T /IHV T as afunction of endurance cycles, respectively. The measurementswere performed across four different devices. Even after 1011bipolar pulses, ILV T /IHV T ∼ 50 is still maintained. We also characterize the retention of the FeFET at 250C and 850C,showing no significant degradation as shown in Fig. 5.III.",1032

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,Abstract,"In 2007 it was found that Si:HfO2 thin films can show ferroelectric behavior if processed under the right conditions. Since then, the discovery has given hope to finally enable the commercialization of memory concepts based on the ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET). By combining the advantages of both read-only-memories (ROM) and random-access-memories (RAM), the FeFET might severely influence the semiconductor memory landscape of the future. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the viability of ferroelectric Si:HfO2 and its derived FeFET application for non-volatile data storage. At the beginning, the ferroelectric effect is explained briefly such that the applications that make use of it can be understood. Afterwards, the latest findings on ferroelectric HfO2 are reviewed and their potential impact on future applications is discussed. The research efforts are furthermore motivated by benchmarking the Si:HfO2-based FeFET concept with respect to state-of-the-art and emerging non-volatile memories (NVM).",230

Besides others, the stability of the ferroelectric switching effect could be demonstrated in a temperature range of almost 400 K. Moreover, nanosecond switching speed and endurance in the range of 106 - 1010 cycles could be proven. Retention and imprint characteristics have furthermore been analyzed and are shown to be stable for 1000 hours bake time at 125 ºC. Derived from the ferroelectric effect in HfO2, a 28 nm FeFET memory cell is introduced as the central application of this thesis. Based on numerical simulations, the memory concept is explained and possible routes towards an optimized FeFET cell are discussed.

By using Si:HfO2 it was possible to realize the world's first 28 nm FeFET devices possessing i.a. 104 cycling endurance and an extrapolated 10 year data retention at room temperature. Moreover, fast transient characterization methodologies were applied in order to prove nanosecond write and read speeds of FeFET-based memory cells. The next step towards a FeFET memory is represented by connecting several memory cells into matrix-type configurations. A cell concept study illustrates the different ways in which FeFET cells can be combined together to give high density memory arrays. For the proposed architectures, operational schemes are theoretically discussed and analyzed by both electrical characterization of FeFET multi-structures and numerical simulations. A new operational scheme called the positive-source-drain-erase-scheme (PSDES) is presented which enables a true random program / erase operation of FeFET-AND-arrays.

This was",89
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,experiment,"ally confirmed in 1920, when the ferroelectric effect was discovered by Valasek during his work on Rochelle salt [202]. Valasek observed an electric P-E hysteresis which was similar to what was already known from the M-H hysteresis in ferromagnetism. In the electric domain, P represents the electric polarization and E the electric field whereas in the magnetic domain, M is the magnetization and H the magnetic field. Hence, the macroscopic definition of a ferroelectric is given in terms of the description of a P-E hysteresis: If a material is of ferroelectric nature, it possesses a permanent polarization which can be reversed by the application of an external electric field [66]. With respect to Maxwell's equations, the polarization P contributes to the electric displacement field which is defined as: (1-1) where D represents the electric displacement field, 0 the vacuum permittivity and E the electric field. For traditional insulators / dielectrics, the contribution of P is in general linearly dependent on the electric field. However, ferroelectrics possess an additional spontaneous polarization PS which is history dependent and responsible for the hysteretic nature of the P-E characteristic as predicted by Schroedinger and verified by Valasek. Hence, the polarization has to be expressed in terms of the sum of field dependent dielectric and ferroelectric contribution and the electric displacement field can be reformulated: 1",320

Hence, as can be seen from equation (1-3), the relative permittivity r can be introduced and enables the separation of the dielectric and ferroelectric contributions to the electric displacement field. The traditional microscopic / crystallographic understanding of the second summand of equation (1-3) is that certain atoms within the crystal unit cell can reside in two stable positions. This leads to a certain degree of polarity / spontaneous polarization inside the unit cell which implies that the crystallographic space group of the ferroelectric has to be non-centrosymmetric [193]. aPs +Ec-Spontaneous PolarizationbPr +Electric FieldidealrealPr-Ec +Ps-Fig. 1-1: Macroscopic and microscopic description of a ferroelectic.

By applying an electric field to PZT, the central Zr / Ti ion can shift into one of two energetically stable positions inside the unit cell. This in turn also shifts the center of charge and",477
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"in a permanent polarization of the material. In a macroscopic PS-E characteristic, the two stable positions are represented by either a positive or a negative spontaneous polarization value PS. In an ideal case, the PS + and the PS- state can be reached by applying the so called coercive field Ec + and Ec- respectively. This would correspond to an ideal rectangular shape of the ferroelectric hysteresis which can however barely be achieved in reality. For example, in ferroelectric ceramics which are inherently of polycrystalline nature, the crystal grains are oriented in a random manner. This in turn leads to different electric field projections with respect to the polar axis of the ferroelectric and hence rather to a distribution of Ec values than to one distinct coercive field [32]. As illustrated in Fig. 1-1 (a), this leads to a deviation from an ideal rectangular towards an s-type shape of the hysteresis. Depending on the width of the coercive field distribution, a difference between PS and the polarization at zero E-field emerges which is expressed in terms of the remanent polarization Pr. From a microscopic point of view, this reduction of the polarization can e.g. be caused by polarization relaxation of nonpolar axis oriented grains [122]. 2",266

This is achieved by applying the so called Berry phase approach and for more information on that topic, the interested reader is referred to [76, 137].

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,INTRODUCTION,"1.1.2Traditional and Modern Ferroelectrics As mentioned in the previous sections, the concept of ferroelectricity was first confirmed by Valasek based on his work with Rochelle salt. However, due to the water solubility of Rochelle salt, the material was not very suitable for applications. The advent of ferroelectrics actually began with the research on high dielectric constant materials. In the course of these studies, ferroelectricity was discovered for barium titanate (BaTiO3 or BTO) which is a polycrystalline ceramic [49, 203, 212]. The main applications that are served by BTO are high dielectric constant capacitors. By use of certain additives, Tc can be shifted from 120 ºC to the desired thermal operating range such that the diverging susceptibility at the phase transition can be utilized. This enables the manufacturing of capacitors possessing dielectric constants up to 104 or even 105 [49]. In the 1950s, two material systems, i.e. lead titante (PbTiO3 or PTO) and lead zirconate (PbZrO3 or PZO), and their solid solution lead zirconate titanate (Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 or PZT) were studied in detail [30]. Whereas PZO is known to show antiferroelectric properties [150], PTO was discovered as a ferroelectric [165]. Most importantly however was that at the so called morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) for Pb(Zr0.55Ti0.45)O3, the most pronounced piezoelectric properties appear [58]. The definition of a MPB includes that the symmetry of the crystal unit cell changes, which in the case of PZT means that the tetragonal crystal structure changes to rhombohedral. Furthermore, due to the fact that the MPB is rather temperature independent, very stable material properties can be maintained over a wide temperature range. This led to the wide adoption of PZT in many applications like transducers, actuators, sensors and of course ferroelectric memories. At this point, it shall already be highlighted that also for HfO2, the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric properties are only visible at the phase boundary between the higher symmetry tetragonal / cubic phase and the lower symmetry monoclinic phase. The difference with respect to PZT is that all of the phases outside the phase transition region show centrosymmetry. In chapter 2 it will be shown that for HfO2, also the composition greatly influences the ferroelectric properties and that there might also be a MPB of high temperature stability. After several decades, PZT became the first ferroelectric that was used in actual semiconductor memories [16] which resulted in the first 4Kbit FRAM in 1993 [136]. However, PZT long suffered from poor fatigue properties [181], i.e. after a certain amount of ferroelectric switching cycles, the material degraded. Hence, research into other ferroelectrics aiming at memory applications had a strong focus on improving these properties. Already during the advent of ceramic ferroelectrics it was found that layered perovskites such as strontium bismuth tantalate (SrBi2Ta2O9 or SBT) also can possess ferroelectric properties [168]. The advantage of this material is that the perovskite strontium tantalate layers are alternatingly interrupted by bismuth oxide layers. This reduces the amount oxygen vacancies which are indirectly responsible for the fatigue mechanism [129]. Hence, in 1995 it could be shown that FRAMs based on SBT are in principle fatigue-free [130]. Nowadays ferroelectric memories based on SBT are used in i.a. commuter fare cards and e-cash systems [176]. At the end of the twentieth century and within the last decade, research on ferroelectrics progressed significantly. This was driven by the ongoing improvements of deposition techniques which nowadays allow to grow single crystalline ferroelectric thin films and superlattices in the range of a few nanometers [34].

Moreover, physical characterization techniques like piezo-force-microscopy (PFM) or high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) combined with electron holography are now available for the in depth analysis of phenomena occurring on the atomic scale [69, 91]. All these advances have finally led to the birth of a new material class called multiferroics [135] which combine both ferroelectric and magnetic effects. These tailor-made material systems might enable new device approaches in the future and are especially promising with respect to memory applications [134, 156]. 1.2Ferroelectric Applications in Industry and Research With the advent of ferroelectric ceramics, many applications followed: Actuators, sensors, transducers, pyroelectric detectors, bypass capacitors, microwave applications and ferroelectric memories are only an excerpt [158, 179]. Due to the fact that this thesis deals with ferroelectric HfO2 in the context of memory applications, the development and state-of-the-art of FRAM and FeFET devices are treated in more detail in the next subsections. Beyond that, emerging semiconductor applications, that may, by the judgment of the author, benefit significantly from the discovery of ferroelectric HfO2, will be discussed as well. 1.2.1Ferroelectric Random Access Memory The concept of a memory utilizing a ferroelectric was first proposed by Buck in 1952 [18]. He proposed to use capacitor structures that possess a ferroelectric, back in that time for example BTO, as an insulator whereas the binary information would be encoded in the ferroelectric polarization state. The differentiation between these two states can be made by analyzing the transient current responses to a voltage pulse depending on the polarization state in which the capacitor resides (Fig. 1-3). abCurrentcPolarizationDatenreihen3FerroelectricPorPDatenreihen2 Datenreihen3VoltageDatenreihen2 PTime or VoltageFig. 1-3: Reading of binary states in a ferroelectric capacitor. (a) A voltage pulse is applied to a ferroelectric capacitor which resides either in a positive (up) or in a negative (down) polarization state. (b) Corresponding transient ferroelectric displacement current as a response to the voltage pulse. (c) The integrated current response leads to the well-known P-E hysteresis. A voltage pulse of positive amplitude is assumed. Hence, assuming a positive voltage pulse applied to a ferroelectric capacitor (Fig. 1-3 (a)), the polarization will switch if the ferroelectric resides in a negative polarization state. The result will be a large ferroelectric displacement current (Fig. 1-3 (b)) that can be observed with measurement setups like the Sawyer-Tower circuit [1]. If the ferroelectric already resides in a positive polarization state, almost no current will flow since no polarization is switched. However, it has to be mentioned that in reality, dielectric displacement currents, leakage currents and relaxation currents are superimposed on the ferroelectric displacement current. Nevertheless, the discrimination between a ""0"" and a ""1"" 6",730
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,INTRODUCTION,"is based on the ferroelectric displacement current. Hence, at this point this explanation shall suffice to understand the basic operational principle of the FRAM. In order to build a memory, Buck proposed a standard n x n matrix architecture which is nowadays best known as a ""cross-bar array"". That is, several capacitors have their top electrodes connected together in one row and their bottom electrodes are furthermore series connected in a column. By that it can be realized that the combination of top electrode row and bottom electrode column is unique to each capacitor (Fig. 1-4 (a)). a bFig. 1-4: Dudley A. Buck's ferroelectric memory from 1952 [18]. (a) Proposed matrix architecture with operational scheme to avoid disturb. V/2 signals are applied to selected rows and columns respectively. Neighboring signal lines are raised or lowered to V/6 such that unselected cells are not exposed to disturb voltages VDISTURB higher than V/3. (b) Requirements for the ferroelectric Q-V hysteresis such that the proposed scheme of (a) works as a disturb-free write / read operation. Buck also realized that in order to write or read binary information from such a cross-bar array, the applied voltage pulses would also disturb the states of the cells which are not supposed to be read or written (Fig. 1-4 (b)). Hence, he proposed an array operation which is nowadays known as the ""VDD/3 scheme"" [199]. He used additional voltages on unselected rows and columns in order to avoid the unwanted polarization switching of cells neighboring the selected capacitor. Unfortunately, Buck's capacitor-only cross-bar architecture never made inroads into real product applications. Due to the fact that ferroelectric ceramics show P-E hystereses that are more similar to Fig. 1-3 (c) than to Fig. 1-4 (b), disturb is inevitable. However, new deposition techniques that enable the epitactic growth of single crystalline ferroelectric thin films might revive Buck's vision of a capacitor-only FRAM. The idea of a ferroelectric memory did however not vanish and in the 1990s, Ramtron was able to introduce first products [136]. By adding an access transistor in series to each ferroelectric capacitor, the disturb problem could be solved. Hence, a 1T-1C (one transistor, one capacitor) cell represents the fundamental memory unit for state-of-the-art FRAM products (Fig. 1-5). aBLBLbPLPLcBLWLWLPLWLA-AWLPLFig. 1-5: State-of-the-art 1T-1C FRAM architecture.

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Besides the row and column signal lines that already exist for a cross-bar architecture, another signal line, the so called wordline, is added in order to control the series connected transistor (Fig. 1-5 (a)). For a read operation, the selected wordline is raised to the internal supply voltage VDD, the plateline is pulsed and the bitlines, which had previously been precharged to ground, are left floating. Depending on the polarization state of the ferroelectric, either a switching or a non-switching current response is the result (see Fig. 1-3). As mentioned previously, in a simplified manner, the different current responses act as the indicator for determining the binary state. However, to be precise, in a real circuit configuration the sensing of the binary states is based on the voltage divider between ferroelectric capacitance CFE and the bitline capacitance CBL. That is, if the ferroelectric capacitor switches, its effective capacitance is larger than for the non-switching case. Hence, the voltage on the bitline is higher for the switching case than for the non-switching case. By comparing these voltages to a reference voltage, the actual sensing of the polarization state takes place. This also illustrates one of the major disadvantages of the FRAM concept, i.e. that the read operation is inherently destructive. However, the re-write operation is automatically achieved due to the bi-stable nature of the sense amplifiers: In case the FRAM capacitor switches during read out, the bitline is raised to the switching voltage by the sense amplifier. By grounding the plateline afterwards, the re-write is achieved. Moreover, a write operation is performed by raising the selected wordline to VDD while keeping the plateline on ground and actively pulsing the bitlines of the cells to be programmed. The bitlines of the cells which are not supposed to be programmed are kept at ground thereby maintaining the polarization state of the ferroelectric capacitor. Due to the destructive read-out (DRO) of the FRAM, the requirements for endurance and fatigue of the ferroelectric material become more stringent: For any type of memory, proper read operations have to be provided over the complete lifespan of the memory device. Hence, assuming a read cycle time of 100 ns, a lifespan of 10 years and continuous read operation, more than 1015 write cycles have to be endured in total. Nevertheless, due to continuous improvements of the capacitor stack, this benchmark can nowadays be achieved [26]. Besides the progress on the material side, many more advances have been made in terms of the FRAM memory cell, sensing concepts and memory architecture. For a thorough summary of these innovations, the interested reader is referred to [140, 162]. At the end of this subsection, the main disadvantage of current FRAM concepts shall be highlighted: As shown in Fig. 1-5 (c), the ferroelectric capacitor in state-of-the-art FRAM products is still of planar type. This in turn means that with ongoing scaling of the technology, the area and therefore the capacitance of the memory cell is continuously shrinking. Consequently, the ratio of ferroelectric capacitance (independent of the switching or non-switching case) to bitline capacitance decreases. This means that at a certain technology node, the read margin will simply be too low to discriminate between ""0"" and ""1"". This is the main reason why FRAM products are currently stuck at the 130 nm technology node [142]. In order to resolve this problem and similar to what had already been done for DRAM decades ago, the ferroelectric capacitor area would have to be increased using trench or stacked capacitors. However, for perovskites like PZT that are used for FRAM capacitors, a conformal deposition into high-aspect ratio 3D capacitors could not be demonstrated yet [83]. Ferroelectric HfO2 however might resolve this road block (see subsection 1.4). 8",835

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,INTRODUCTION,"The last FeFET architecture of MFMIS-type tries to solve the retention problem by inserting a floating gate in between the buffer layer and the ferroelectric. This would provide sufficient charge compensation for the ferroelectric polarization due to the fact that an actual bottom electrode is present. Hence, the MFMIS is a true series connection of an MFM and a MOS capacitor. Unfortunately, besides the more complicated manufacturing procedure due to the bottom electrode, potential leakage currents from e.g. the bulk into the floating gate might render the MFMIS non-functional. If charge injection by excessive leakage current happens, electrons will accumulate on the floating gate and the ferroelectric control over the channel is lost. The target cell structure of this thesis is of MFIS-type since the integration requires only small adjustments to a standard high-k metal-gate (HKMG) process flow (see also section 3.3).

In order to store binary states in an MFIS cell, the polarization of the ferroelectric is controlled by the electric field across the gate stack. The easiest way to write a binary state to a FeFET cell is by applying a voltage pulse to the gate terminal while keeping source, drain and bulk on ground. If the pulse is of positive polarity and high enough to overcome the coercive field of the ferroelectric, the polarization will flip into the ""down"" state. Within this thesis, applying a positive pulse to the gate is called programming and consequently the cell resides in the programmed state afterwards. The polarization of the ferroelectric is then compensated by electrons from the source, drain and bulk regions. This effectively shifts the threshold voltage VT of the transistor to lower values. The application of a negative voltage pulse to the gate induces exactly the opposite behavior: The polarization flips into the ""up"" state which causes holes to accumulate at the gate stack to bulk interface. This is called the erased state which shifts the threshold voltage of the MFIS-FeFET to higher values. Similar to floating gate (FG) devices which shift the threshold voltage by charge storage in the floating gate, the binary states of a FeFET are also encoded in the value of VT. However, the shifts in VT that are caused by the program and erase operations are exactly inverted when comparing FG devices to FeFETs. For FG devices, a positive gate pulse injects electrons into the floating gate and therefore shifts the VT to higher values. The negative gate pulse releases the electrons from the FG and shifts the VT again back to lower values. The inverted behavior of FeFET devices as compared to FG devices is sometimes also illustrated in terms of a hysteretic drain current versus gate voltage (Id-Vg) sweep. For FG 10",400
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,INTRODUCTION,"devices, such a sweep will show clockwise behavior due to charge injection at high positive voltages. For a FeFET device, the behavior is counterclockwise due to the fact that the polarization flips into the down state when the gate voltage overcomes EC (see Fig. 1-7 middle). Thus, at first sight, the operation of a ferroelectric field effect transistor is very similar to floating gate or charge trap devices, even though based on fundamentally different physics. Accordingly, the advantages of FG architectures can in principle be inherited by the FeFET concept: Small cell size footprint due to 1T architectures, unlimited read endurance due to non-destructive read-out (NDRO) and, as compared to e.g. the FRAM approach, good scalability due to different encoding of the binary state. The last point mentioned refers to the fact that the FeFET is, to a first approximation, independent of the amount of switched charge. By utilizing the transistor architecture, the read-out operation can exploit the transconductance of a MOSFET which significantly improves the read margin. Moreover, the FeFET approach offers multiple additional benefits that make it an attractive alternative to Flash-based devices even after more than 40 years of FG device development. Especially the advantages of FeFETs based on ferroelectric HfO2 will be highlighted in subsection 1.4. 1.2.3Future CMOS Applications Based on Ferroelectrics Even though a FeFET memory is one of the most obvious applications for a ferroelectric material, there are various research fields that might also make use of novel ferroelectrics in the future. The following considerations will be limited to CMOS applications that, from the viewpoint of the author, represent the most innovative approaches which utilize the properties of ferroelectrics. First of all, besides utilizing a FeFET as an NVM cell, various industry and research groups have also proposed to make use of the ferroelectric non-volatility for logic applications: Non-volatile CMOS circuits [145], dynamically programmable gate arrays [97] or a ferroelectric flip-flop [205], SRAM [104, 188] and DRAM [50] cells are only some of these proposals. This might lead to significant improvements in the field of reconfigurable computing [47, 127] or to non-volatile processor architectures altogether [206, 213]. Besides these innovative concepts, even more radical approaches are looking for novel computer architectures beyond the classical von Neumann model. By utilization of the memristive behavior of ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ) [23] or of the FeFET itself [124, 198], neural networks based on the ferroelectric effect might become viable in the future. In 2013, Panasonic successfully demonstrated a 3T-FeMEM (three-terminal ferroelectric memristor) neural network including 9 neurons and 144 synapses [71]. Finally, the ferroelectric transistor might also be useful to optimize a standard transistor device by use of the so-called negative capacitance effect [146, 147]. That is, the imperfect switching properties of a transistor, which are represented by the so called subthreshold-slope, can be improved by use of a ferroelectric inside the gate stack. Hence, the active as well as passive power consumption of standard logic devices could be reduced similar to other approaches aiming at steep subthreshold-slope devices [56]. A detailed description of this so called negative capacitance field effect transistor (NCFET) can be found in [144, 148]. In the next section, the recent progress regarding the research of ferroelectricity in HfO2 will be presented. Especially due to the unparalleled CMOS compatibility as well as the scalability of HfO2, many of the above mentioned research directions might benefit from the discovery. 11",825
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,INTRODUCTION,"1.3Discovery of Ferroelectricity in HfO2 At the time the semiconductor industry introduced HfO2 as MOSFET high-k dielectric, the material was also evaluated as a potential dielectric for DRAM capacitors. Hafnium oxide is known to possess several polymorphs and crystallizes into the monoclinic P21/c phase at ambient conditions, into a tetragonal P42/nmc phase at 2000 K and finally into a cubic Fm3m phase at 2900 K. Due to the fact that the theoretical dielectric constant changes from 16 to 70 and 29 for the mentioned polymorphs [222], especially a stabilization of the tetragonal phase is highly desirable for DRAM applications. The higher permittivity values increase the capacitance which provides then more charge for read-out of the DRAM. This effectively enables further scaling of the memory cell. Moreover it was found that the high temperature polymorphs can be stabilized at room temperature if different dopant atoms like Si, Al, Gd or Y [87, 195] are used as substituting species for Hf. In 2007 and during the course of the study on Si:HfO2, i.e. utilizing silicon as a substituting species, a deviation from the standard dielectric behavior of HfO2 was discovered [12]. This anomaly occurred for approximately 5 mol% silicon incorporation which stabilized HfO2 right at the phase boundary in between monoclinic and tetragonal. Based on various",347

[77] and was later also theoretically confirmed by Lowther et al. [92]. Moreover, the direct incorporation of ferroelectric HfO2 into a high-k metal-gate (HKMG) transistor stack yielded functional FeFET devices with counter-clockwise hysteresis behavior [13]. Based on the Si:HfO2 system it was possible to demonstrate the world's first 28 nm ferroelectric field effect transistor [113] which is explicitly analyzed in chapter 4. Several other dopant elements and material compositions were subsequently identified to cause ferroelectricity in HfO2 as well. Right after the discovery of ferroelectricity in the Si:HfO2 system, the same behavior was also reported for the solid solution of HfO2 and ZrO2 [109]. The most pronounced ferroelectric properties in this system appeared for Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 which was quite different as compared to the 5 mol% silicon incorporation in the Si:HfO2 system. Nevertheless, it represented a reasonable result due to the fact that the HfxZr1-xO2 system crosses the mentioned phase boundary for a mixing ratio of approximately 1:1 [108]. As anticipated from previous studies on high-k phase stabilization, it was confirmed that 3 - 10 mol% of Y [110], Al [116], Gd [115] or Sr [151] incorporation can also induce ferroelectric properties for HfO2. Together with antiferroelectricity / the field driven ferroelectric phase transition for pure ZrO2 [112, 139], the picture of a ferroelectric phase transition in HfO2 was strengthened. 12",388

Ramtron (Cypress), Texas Instruments and Fujitsu are using PZT as ferroelectric material whereas Panasonic and ROHM (Lapis Semiconductor) use SBT.

With respect to the remanent polarization a ferroelectric can provide, it is known that SBT possesses a much smaller PS value than PZT. For an FRAM, a lower remanent polarization is not desirable because the switched charge required for sensing becomes less. However, analyzing the sensing of an FRAM more closely reveals that the non-switched charge obviously affects the sensing margin in a similar fashion. That is, the switched charge should be as large as possible (large PS) and the non-switched charge should be as small as possible (low dielectric constant of the ferroelectric). Since the dielectric constant of SBT is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than for PZT, the drawback of a smaller remanent polarization is diminished.",197
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,Experiment,"s on ferroelectric HfO2 have shown that the remanent polarization can be tuned in a wide range from almost zero up to 40 C/cm2. Furthermore, the dielectric constant is, compared to SBT or PZT, very small (30) which is also favorable for a 1T-1C concept. Moreover, as will be shown in more detail in chapter 3, the comparatively small dielectric constant of ferroelectric HfO2 is even more beneficial for FeFET-type applications. Again with respect to an FRAM application, ferroelectric HfO2 however has one major disadvantage: The coercive field required for reversing the polarization is around one order of magnitude larger than for SBT or PZT. Even though film thicknesses of 5 nm were demonstrated (which corresponds to a coercive voltage of Vc = 0.5 V), a smaller coercive field is always advantageous for FRAM applications. On the other hand, with respect to FeFET applications, this property of HfO2 is exactly what enabled the realization of the world's first 28 nm FeFET (see chapter 3). Finally, the strategically most relevant advantage of ferroelectric HfO2 is given by its proven CMOS compatibility at state-of-the-art technology nodes. Whereas Pb and Bi always pose the threat of contamination and deterioration of logic device performance, HfO2 is well accepted in any HKMG process flow. Besides the mentioned material properties, this might, by judgment of the author, represent the most significant advantage of ferroelectric HfO2 that could foster increased research and industrial efforts in the future. 14",357

Depending on memory architecture and type, write speeds are further subdivided on a program / erase and on per bit / page / sector / block basis. Especially for NAND and NOR Flash, this causes the speed ranges to be quite wide. The first two columns of Tab. 1-2 list state-of-the-art NAND and NOR Flash characteristics as they are present in stand-alone memory products. The two technologies are both based on charge storage in a floating gate or trap layer which shifts the threshold voltage of a transistor and thereby encodes the binary state. On the one hand, NAND and NOR differ in terms of the way cells are connected together in an array (an illustration can be found in chapter 5). This is the reason why the cell size of NOR is more than double the cell size of NAND. On the other hand, the two concepts differ with respect to their programming mechanism: For NAND-Flash, charges are injected into the storage layer by means of Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling whereas for NOR-Flash they are injected by channel-hot-electron injection (CHE). Both mechanisms differ in terms of their injection efficiency and therefore in terms of their write speed and write energy. In the last years, scaling of NAND-based floating gate devices advanced to the 16 nm node. Together with its small cell size of 4F2 (F stands for the minimum feature size and reflects the smallest geometry that can be manufactured on a certain technology node) and the ability to store multiple bits in one memory cell (multi-level-cell, MLC), NAND Flash still offers the highest storage capacity of all solid-state memories. However, increasing the bit density of NAND Flash becomes more and more difficult due to scaling issues like cell-to-cell interference and the ever decreasing number of charge carriers representing binary states [99]. Nevertheless, large companies have already succeeded in integrating NAND Flash into 3D architectures which might represent a path to continue on Moore's Law also in the future. 15",1138
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,INTRODUCTION,"One of the major problems that come with NAND Flash is its very high operational voltage required for programming and erasing a memory cell. This represents an issue that is inherent to the concept of encoding binary states based on charge carriers injected into a storage layer: Due to the fact that the charges stored on e.g. a floating gate must not leak out within a ten year data retention period, the tunnel oxide thickness has to have a thickness of around 8 nm. Accordingly, this requires high voltages in the range of 15 - 25 V in order to reach electric fields of 12 MV/cm that are required for injecting charges into the floating gate. Moreover, the peripheral charge pumps required for generating such high voltages are only efficient to a certain degree. Due to these high voltages and the low programming efficiency of periphery, the energy required for storing the information is relatively high.

Besides the additional scaling issues that come with CHE injection, the different programming mechanism nevertheless offers a faster programming speed at slightly reduced amplitudes. However, since CHE injection is based on current flow through the transistor channel, its power consumption and therefore the energy/bit is the highest of all concepts shown in Tab. 1-2. Due to the fact that the binary data encoding is the same as for NAND Flash, i.e. a VT-shift due to charges injected into the gate stack, the write endurance of NOR Flash is quite similar. Even though some concepts like nanocrystal Flash have managed to slightly improve cycling stability [215], also NOR Flash endurance is fundamentally limited by the degradation of the tunneling barrier. The emerging memory technologies are represented by Spin-Torque Magnetic-RAM (ST-RAM), Phase-Change-Memory (PCM) and Resistive-RAM (RRAM). In this context, the term ""emerging"" means that these memory technologies are still predominantly in the R&D stage. These concepts have been developed for the last two decades and are gradually reaching sample (ST-RAM) or product stage (PCM, RRAM). Due to the fact that Ferroelectric-RAM (FRAM) reached product stage already in the 1990s, it is not considered an emerging memory anymore. The ST-RAM is an 1T-1R (one-transistor, one-resistor) concept utilizing a transistor as an access device and a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) as resistor. In the resistor part, two magnetic thin film layers are separated by a thin tunneling barrier. The ST-RAM then encodes the binary data in a low and a high electrical resistance state (LRS and HRS respectively) which is experienced by a tunneling current through the barrier. The low resistance state is achieved in case the magnetic polarizations of the two thin films are parallel whereas the high resistance state evolves for anti-parallel orientation. The first ST-RAM samples are currently being manufactured on a 90 nm technology node whereas 30 nm single cell demonstrations already exist [78]. However, the cell size of the ST-RAM technology is currently still determined by the size of the access transistor which has to be very wide in order to provide enough current to write the cell [217]. Moreover, for highly scaled MTJs, a statistically stable magnetic polarization still needs to be proven. Furthermore, even though ST-RAM requires only very low voltages and can switch in the nanosecond regime, a high write current is required for changing the magnetization 16",545

The in principle infinite write endurance of ST-RAM also needs to be demonstrated on array level and is currently limited to approximately 105 cycles. The PCM concept is also based on an 1T-1R architecture whereas the resistor consists of a chalcogenide material. The difference between the resistance values originates from two distinguishable crystallographic states of the chalcogenide, i.e. amorphous or crystalline. In order to switch between these states, the Joule heat generated by the current flow through the resistor is utilized to crystallize or quench the chalcogenide. A longer SET pulse ( 150 ns) of reduced amplitude causes crystallization of the chalcogenide and induces the LRS. A short but higher RESET pulse ( 50 ns) causes amorphization of the chalcogenide which in turn leads to the HRS [19]. Similar to ST-RAM, the write operation of PCM is based on current flow which effectively impedes write operations below the picojoule range. Moreover, endurance has been demonstrated up to 109 cycles and is specified with 106 in first products manufactured by Micron [100]. Another class of memories that has recently transitioned from research to product stage is called Resistive RAM. Even though ST-RAM and PCM are also resisitive memories, the term RRAM is mainly used for systems achieving a reversible resistance change by redox-related chemical effects [209]. For example, the first product to include RRAM is based on a TaOx thin film. Different meta-stable phases of the transition metal oxide (TMO) can be stabilized or destabilized by the movement of oxygen ions which effectively",376

Moreover, the fact that RRAMs are envisioned to be arranged in 3D cross-bar architectures might enable effective cell sizes of less than 1 F2. In the future, due to their 3D integration potential together with proven MLC capability, RRAMs are considered to be the most viable candidate to replace NAND Flash memories. Nevertheless, even though for RRAM write speeds are in the nanosecond regime and programming voltages are relatively low, due to the current driven write mechanism also these memories are not an ultimate low-power solution. In the 1990s, capacitor based ferroelectric memories (FRAM) actually were the first emerging NVM that could combine the fast operation of RAM with the non-volatility of a ROM. However, due to the planar architecture of the capacitor, FRAM was not able to scale into Gbit generations. As compared to the ST-RAM, PCM and RRAM, it is essential to highlight that FRAM-memories are based on a completely different operational principle: Since both write and read are based on the electrical field effect to surmount the coercive field of the ferroelectric, only the ferroelectric as well as the dielectric displacement current contribute to energy consumption. Hence, ferroelectric memories are by far the most energy efficient NVMs in the market. Furthermore, the decade long material and electrode development finally resulted in products that practically possess infinite write endurance. The discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO2 promises to provide the general advantages of ferroelectrics without the drawbacks that were faced by scaling classical FRAMs. Due to the fact that film thicknesses can be reduced to approximately 5 nm, high-density ferroelectric applications might become viable by use of the FeFET concept. At the beginning of this thesis it was known that Si:HfO2 FeFETs can at least be scaled to channel lengths of 80 nm. Further scaling to a 28 nm technology node was analyzed during the course of this thesis. Moreover, the 1T architecture of the FeFET might either adopt architectures similar to NAND (4 F2) or NOR (10 F2). This will mainly depend on the various ferroelectric disturb scenarios that are different for each architecture. An analysis can be found in chapter 5. Another task of this thesis was also to provide information about important memory characteristics like thermal stability, retention and endurance of the 17",512
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,INTRODUCTION,"ferroelectric and the FeFET in order to give a proper estimate on the potential of the HfO2 FeFET. Due to the fact that the sensing of the FeFET does not depend on the amount of switched charge of the ferroelectric, its minimum area is only defined by lithography limits. Accordingly, the energy required to alter the cell state on a cutting edge technology node can easily be estimated (excluding system overhead like charge pump efficiency): ( )(1-9) In the above calculation, a worst case programming voltage of 5 V was assumed. Moreover a switched charge of 20 C/cm2 appears to be a reasonable assumption for ferroelectric HfO2 and the minimum area is derived from the lithography limits of a 28 nm technology node. Hence, it becomes clear that a 28 nm FeFET would reduce the per bit energy consumption to below one femtojoule. Compared to state-of-the-art as well as emerging memory solutions, the FeFET would by far represent the most energy efficient NVM solution. Besides the excellent CMOS compatibility of the HfO2 ferroelectric, the energy efficiency of the concept was one of the major drivers for this thesis. In the next chapter, the discovered ferroelectric properties of HfO2 are tested with respect to the stringent requirements that are imposed by memory applications. Based on these characteristics, a sound judgment can be given regarding the suitability of ferroelectric HfO2 as a memory material. In the subsequent chapters, these findings are then transferred to the target device application, i.e. the ferroelectric field effect transistor. 18 MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF FERROELECTRIC HFO22Material Properties of Ferroelectric HfO2The target material composition that is analyzed throughout this thesis is represented by silicon doped hafnium oxide (Si:HfO2). Even though additional dopant species like aluminum or gadolinium were also characterized in detail [115, 116], due to its proven CMOS compatibility, only the Si:HfO2 was utilized for FeFET fabrication later on. In this chapter, the hysteretic properties of Si:HfO2 metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) capacitors are analyzed first. Large signal polarization versus electrical field (P-E) represent the most suitable electrical characterization methodology to visualize the phenomenon of ferroelectric hysteresis. Especially with respect to memory applications, these characteristics are analyzed in terms of the temperature stability of polarization switching. This is an important measure for determining the potential application space of a novel memory technology. Moreover, depending on processing conditions and thermal annealing treatments, conditioning effects were discovered to be present in the Si:HfO2 system. Due to the field cycling based conditioning sequence, a homogenization of the ferroelectric properties could be observed. The fact that ferroelectric polarization reversal can be achieved at the speed of sound [183], i.e. for nanometer-sized thin films in the range of picoseconds, ferroelectric memories can in principle reach processor speeds. This makes these types of memories attractive as true RAM replacement [159]. Hence, the switching speed limitations of the Si:HfO2 films were characterized by modified Positive-Up Negative-Down (PUND) measurements. This leads to the proposal of a nucleation-limited-switching (NLS) mechanism in Si:HfO2. Besides a fast switching mechanism, the Si:HfO2 system has to fulfill several other important memory benchmarks in order to be useful as an NVM storage material. One important parameter is represented by the number of polarization reversals the ferroelectric material can endure. The phenomenon leading to polarization loss during the course of bipolar voltage cycling is called ferroelectric fatigue and is analyzed for different annealing conditions of ferroelectric capacitors. Moreover, the actually most important characteristic of a non-volatile memory is represented by its ability to retain binary data for at least 10 years when power supply is removed. In order to analyze this specific property for Si:HfO2, so called retention tests were performed in order to investigate proper non-volatile data storage. The last of the memory characteristics that was investigated is an effect that is rather unique to ferroelectrics. Under certain circumstances, the ferroelectric coercive fields drift over time leading to one polarization state that is preferred whereas the other one is unfavored. These so called imprint characteristics are presented as a function of both annealing temperature and storage time at 125 ºC. 2.1Polarization Hysteresis in Si:HfO2The most prevalent visualization of ferroelectric material characteristics is given in terms of the polarization hysteresis. In order to acquire these characteristics, a triangular voltage signal is applied to an MFM capacitor and the current response is recorded. From the current response, the large signal polarization and capacitance hysteresis can be derived [40]. For a dielectric insulator material, the current response to a triangular voltage signal is obviously a constant current which changes sign when the triangular signal changes its slope from rising to falling. However, for a ferroelectric, the response is quite different (Fig. 2-1). 19 MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF FERROELECTRIC HFO2abcC1V/It31VVVC1-VC-VC +VC1 +22P3VC2-VC2 +Fig. 2-1: Theoretical and actual ferroelectric P-V and C-V characteristic.

Numbers indicate domain orientations at characteristic points in the (anti-) ferroelectric hysteresis. (c) Large signal capacitance-voltage characteristic as derived from the polarization characteristic. Coercive voltages VC are indicated. At the point in time when the triangular voltage signal reaches the coercive voltage of the ferroelectric, a large current peak can be observed (Fig. 2-1 (a)). For an ideal ferroelectric, that current pulse would be described by a Dirac delta function since this represents an operation of ideally instantaneous switching. However, due to random grain orientation and the existence of defects and pinning centers, a distribution of coercive voltages is present in actual ferroelectric materials [8]. For an antiferroelectric material, these considerations hold as well whereas actually four and not two current peaks occur in the transient response. The two peaks that occur on the falling edges of the excitation signal can be assigned to back-switching from a parallel into an anti-parallel domain state [79]. The fundamental origin of antiferroelectricity is however quite complex and most recent studies indicate that flexoelectricity (spontaneous polarization induced by a strain gradient) plays an important role for the understanding of antiferroelectric materials [180]. Integrating the recorded current response with respect to voltage / time and dividing it by the area of the capacitor yields the electric displacement field D (Fig. 2-1 (b)). By neglecting the contribution of vacuum to the electric displacement field it is possible to replace D with P. This is a reasonable assumption because the growth of the electric displacement field due to the contribution of vacuum amounts to only  0.1 C/cm2 per 1 MV/cm applied electrical field. Hence, for a dielectric, the polarization response is simply a straight line whereas for a ferroelectric, the well-known hysteresis with polarization remanence manifests. For an antiferroelectric, two hysteresis occur, one in the first and the other one in the third quadrant of the P-V characteristic. Here it becomes visible that the parallel alignment of domains requires higher fields as compared to a ferroelectric material composition. This is sometimes also described in terms of a field driven ferroelectric phase transition [186], i.e. the energy required for the ferroelectric phase to appear has to be provided by the electrical field that is applied. Calculating the derivative of the P-V characteristic with respect to voltage",540
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"in the large signal capacitance voltage characteristic (Fig. 2-1 (c)). However, the difference to a standard C-V characterization has to be highlighted: For a traditional capacitance-voltage measurement of e.g. metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors, a dedicated capacitance-voltage-unit (CVU) is utilized [74]. It enables the superposition of a DC voltage ramp together with an AC small-signal excitation. Hence, a traditional C-V measurement is a small-signal characterization. At each DC-bias point, the current response due to the AC signal is recorded and the impedance of the device under test (DUT) is derived. This gives 20 MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF FERROELECTRIC HFO2a more appropriate measure on the intrinsic capacitance as a function of the applied voltage. Before presenting Si:HfO2 P-V characteristics, a short comment on P-V versus P-E characteristics shall be added: From the viewpoint of materials science it would actually be more appropriate to speak in terms of P-E characteristics, i.e. in terms of the coercive fields instead of the coercive voltages. The coercive field is more of an intrinsic material property which is better suited to compare between different materials. Nevertheless, it also varies according to an Ec(d)  d -2/3 relationship [73]. With respect to an application driven investigation it is sometimes more useful to speak in terms of voltages that have to be applied in order to write the desired binary state. In the end, an important benchmark for judging a memory concept is always the voltage that is required to program and erase the NVM cell. 2.1.1Composition and Annealing Dependence The principle of inducing ferroelectric properties in hafnium oxide is based on the stabilization of the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic Pbc21 phase. Various measures exist which make the ferroelectric phase favorable: Incorporation of different dopant species [14, 110, 115, 116], post metallization annealing or variation of the thin film thickness itself [218] are only some of these methods. Since this thesis focusses on the Si:HfO2 system, in this subsection the P-V characteristics are first of all analyzed as a function of silicon content incorporated into the HfO2 host lattice. Later, the dependence of the hysteretic properties on the annealing temperature will be presented in addition. In order to analyze the P-V characteristics, MFM capacitors were used that had been fabricated on standard 300 mm silicon substrates. First, a 10 nm TiN bottom electrode was deposited at 450 ºC in an ALD batch furnace using TiCl4 and NH3 as precursor gases. A single wafer ALD process was subsequently used to deposit the 10 nm Si:HfO2 functional layer at 266 ºC. Tetrakisethylmethylaminohafnium (TEMAH), tetrakisdi-methylaminosilane (4DMAS) as well as ozone were used as precursor gases. Various samples with different silicon molar concentrations ranging from 4.9 mol% to 7.8 mol% could be realized by varying the precursor gases pulse ratios (TEMAH:4DMAS) from 12:1 to 6:1. After the Si:HfO2 layer was deposited, a 10 nm TiN top electrode was processed again in the ALD batch furnace. Then, the Si:HfO2 compositions were either left as-deposited (thermal budget of TiN process: 450 ºC / 7 h) or split and annealed at 650 ºC / 20 s, 800 ºC / 20 s or 1000 ºC / 10 s. Platinum dots were evaporated through a shadow mask and served as a hard mask for etching the TiN top electrode. This led to the formation of capacitor geometries (A = 104m2) that could properly be contacted and tested on a standard single needle probe station. P-V measurements were performed on an aixACCT TF Analyzer 3000 and the frequency of the triangular voltage signal was set to 1 kHz.",942

The polarization versus electric field characteristics are shown for four different silicon dopant concentrations. For 7.8 mol%, ferroelectric relaxation is highlighted by the comparison of the extrapolated spontaneous polarization against the remanent polarization. The 6.6 mol% composition is superimposed by the 7.8 mol% composition (dashed hysteresis) in order to further illustrate relaxation effects. Transient current responses to the triangular voltage signal are shown as inset. The ratio of relaxed remanent and transient remanent polarization is shown on the right. For a large amount of silicon incorporated into the HfO2 lattice, antiferroelectric or relaxor-type [31, 149] tendencies can be discovered. That is, for an antiferroelectric there is actually no remanence since domains will flip back into the antiparallel state when the absolute magnitude of the applied voltage falls below VC2 (see Fig. 2-1). However, since the ferroelectric phenomena in polycrystalline hafnia occur at the phase boundary between monoclinic and tetragonal / cubic, statistical effects should be considered as well. Hence, there could be different regions of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric tendency whose superposition leads to a hysteresis as seen for the 7.8 mol% composition. Though, since switching into the presumably parallel domain configuration occurs at around the same voltage as compared to the other compositions, ferroelectric relaxation represents the most likely cause. For silicon contents of 6.6 mol% and 5.8 mol%, the Pr / PS ratio improves significantly due to a higher polarization remanence. Furthermore, the coercive field grows by approximately 0.1 MV/cm for 6.6 mol% to 5.8 mol%. For the lowest analyzed silicon content of 4.9 mol%, the remanent polarization started to decrease significantly whereas the hysteresis shape remained almost ideal. Due to the fact that the monoclinic phase becomes energetically more favorable for lower silicon contents, the reduced remanent polarization might be attributed to a reduced ferroelectric phase fraction similar to",630

Moreover, the standard polarization measurement is performed in such a way that it also enables the extraction of polarization relaxation, which is a well-known effect occurring in ferroelectrics. On a microscopic scale, ferroelectric relaxation can be correlated to grain orientations that are off-axis oriented with respect to the polarization axis of the unit cell [122]. Hence, especially for highly scaled ferroelectric devices, the extraction of macroscopic polarization relaxation on MFM capacitors might give important insights into effects taking place on the microscopic scale. In order to study the ferroelectric relaxation behavior, the pulse train that is utilized for P-E measurements consists of actually four triangular voltage pulses (Fig. 2-3). time1s1s1sFig. 2-3: Measurement sequence applied for P-E characterization.

For both second and fourth pulse, after a delay time of one second, the current response to the triangular voltage signal is recorded. The polarization can then be derived as described e.g. in Fig. 2-1. More importantly, the final hysteresis that is recorded represents the sum of the second halves of the polarization responses to pulse two and four. Hence, a true transient polarization response is derived. The first halves of the recorded pulses however contain additional information, i.e. the amount of relaxed polarization: Due to the fact that there is a delay time of one second in between each triangular voltage pulse, unstable ferroelectric domains will relax before another excitation signal is applied. This can be extracted from the polarization data and represents the so called relaxed remanent polarization Pr,rel. This parameter can be compared to the transient remanent polarization Pr that is recorded based on the sum of the second halves of pulse two and four. For the different Si:HfO2 compositions, the ratio of Pr,rel/Pr was calculated and is shown in Fig. 2-2 on the right. The",312

The polarization versus electric field characteristics are shown for different silicon molar concentrations and post-metallization-annealing (PMA) conditions.

Due to the paraelectric nature of the 6.6 mol% composition at 450 ºC and 650 ºC, for these samples, no reasonable Pr,rel/Pr extraction could be performed. 23 MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF FERROELECTRIC HFO2As it is known from previous research on Si:HfO2, a larger amount of dopant species incorporated into the HfO2 host lattice shifts the crystallization temperature to higher values [195]. This can also be observed for the 6.6 mol% composition which stays paraelectric up to 650 ºC. At 800 ºC, a proper ferroelectric hysteresis develops whereas a certain amount of polarization relaxes when the sweeping voltages approaches 0 V. Hence, the Pr/PS ratio is degraded. Furthermore, this is again confirmed by the Pr,rel/Pr ratio which shows that for the 6.6 mol% composition annealed at 800 ºC the polarization degrades by about 30% within the one second delay time. This improves even further when the annealing temperature is raised to 1000 ºC. Comparing these",676

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,introduction,"of this section, for ferroelectric thin films in the range of nanometers, the switching can theoretically be achieved within picoseconds [183]. Moreover, for an ideal ferroelectric, the switching event is a perfect threshold process at Ec and hence, no retention loss should be observed below the coercive field. Of course in reality, both ferroelectric switching speed and data retention deviate from the theoretical predictions. The degree of deviation obviously influences the feasibility of a memory concept and therefore will be addressed specifically in the following sections. This section will address the first part of the voltage-time dilemma, i.e. how fast Si:HfO2 can actually be switched between Pr + and Pr-. In the succeeding section, the second part of the voltage-time dilemma, that is data retention, will be analyzed. The most common procedure to quantify switching kinetics in ferroelectrics is represented by an electrical positive-up negative-down (PUND) test [40]. The PUND test very closely resembles the actual operation of an FRAM memory, i.e. the pulsing of the plateline and the read-out of the corresponding switching current (which is in reality translated to a change in the CBL / CS ratio). Another alternative to judge the switching kinetic of a ferroelectric would be by a frequency dependent P-E (f) measurement. However, due to the fact that for very fast measurements the actual ferroelectric switching current has to be recorded in the MHz regime, the indirect PUND approach represents the method of choice. The original PUND method utilizes a pulse train of two consecutive positive pulses (P and U) followed by two consecutive negative pulses (N and D). Each pulse leads to a different current response whose integral can be assigned to the various branches of a ferroelectric hysteresis (Fig. 2-7). 27 MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF FERROELECTRIC HFO2aPW1P23U45N67D8Resetb2-4P618EV / I5Amp-timeFig. 2-7: PUND pulse sequence and corresponding hysteresis graph. (a) The pulse width and amplitude of the first pulse are varied and the following pulses are used for read-out. The last pulse again sets a reference state. Color coding and numbers correlate the current responses to the branches of the hysteresis in (b). The grey area highlights the reduced PUND sequence that was used in the thesis. Before the four pulses of the PUND sequence are applied, the negative polarization state has to be written first. The first pulse of negative polarity can be parameterized in terms of its amplitude and pulse width in order to extract the switching kinetics of the thin film. Afterwards, the actual PUND sequence is carried out (Fig. 2-7 (a)). The pulse widths and absolute amplitudes of the four pulses should be identical and high enough / long enough in order to ensure that the ferroelectric is brought into complete saturation. Depending on the magnitude of the P pulse current response it is possible to calculate the amount of polarization that has been switched by the parameterized first pulse. Therefore, the U pulse current response is subtracted from the P pulse current response. This effectively eliminates contributions from dielectric displacement and leakage currents such that the pure ferroelectric switching current is extracted. This assumption is of course only valid if leakage currents are independent of the polarization state [121]. Integration of the P-U current response with respect to time and division by the MFM capacitor areas",898

The amount of switched polarization as a function of the, in terms of pulse amplitude and pulse width, parameterized first pulse is the actual measure for the switching dynamic of a ferroelectric. The succeeding N and D pulse again reverse the polarization and act as a reference for how much polarization should have been switched by the parameterized first pulse. The last pulse resets the device into a saturated positive polarization state such that the next parameterized pulse sequence can be applied. In order to analyze the switching kinetics of the positive polarization state, all voltage polarities simply have to be inverted. Within this thesis, a reduced PUND measurement, utilizing only a parameterized and two consecutive pulses of same voltage polarity, was applied. This reduced the amount of sampled data points and by increasing the parameterized pulse width to and above the P and U pulse widths, the N-D reference was included in the measurement",195

The polarization that is switched (PSW) by the first pulse (highlighted in red) depends on both the width and amplitude of the pulse. Logarithmic fits of the PSW are shown as dashed lines. The switched polarization is normalized to PSW achieved for 0.1 s pulse width and maximum amplitude. Different write amplitudes were used for positive and negative voltage polarities due to an asymmetry of the polarization response. The resulting PSW versus pulse width graphs could be fitted logarithmically whereas this behavior was not in accordance with the standard Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi (KAI) model [5, 82, 126]. In the past, such characteristics had been observed for e.g. 135 nm Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 (PZT) thin films and were explained by a nucleation-limited-switching (NLS) model [171, 182]. Due to the small film thickness, NLS models assume that domain coalescence can be neglected and that nucleation statistics dominate the switching kinetics [62]. Since the Si:HfO2 films are at least an order of magnitude thinner than standard ferroelectric thin films, it is a reasonable assumption to apply the NLS model. In summary, Fig. 2-8 reflects that for pulse widths down to 10 s, around 80 % of the available polarization could be switched. Increasing the excitation voltages to  3V (not shown in the graph because of independence of pulse width) led to a normalized PSW that was close to unity even for a pulse width of 10 s. Hence, by logarithmic extrapolation, switching dynamics in the range of nanoseconds would be expected. This indicates that the first part of the voltage-time dilemma can properly be solved by ferroelectric Si:HfO2. The second part, i.e. if the polarization states can be maintained for a longer period of time, will be analyzed in the next section. 29 MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF FERROELECTRIC HFO22.3Specific Characteristics with Focus on Non-Volatile Memories Besides the second part of the voltage-time dilemma, this section will focus on material characteristics of Si:HfO2 that are specifically important from an NVM application perspective. First, the amount of write cycles that the material can endure will be analyzed. This corresponds to how often the polarization of the ferroelectric can be changed from a positive to a negative polarization state which in turn is identical to the number of hysteresis cycles that the material can withstand. In the end, the result of this characterization represents an essential benchmark for judging the ability to replace RAM cells with Si:HfO2-based ferroelectric memory cells. As an example, DRAMs are specified to endure continuous write operations ( 40 ns / write operation / bit) over a period of ten years. This corresponds to approximately 1016 write operations in total. For an actual NVM, the benchmark is much more relaxed and is in the range of 103 (MLC Flash) to 106 (SLC Flash) write operations. Hence, depending on the amount of write cycles the Si:HfO2 can endure, the potential memory architectures that might be addressed can be derived. The second part of the voltage-time dilemma, i.e. the retention of the polarization state, is addressed afterwards. From an NVM perspective, retention tests are fundamental to the concept of non-volatile data storage. In general, a non-volatile memory has to ensure that data is retained for a period of 10 years. In order to prove such characteristics, tests were carried out under temperature acceleration. Moreover, the retention measurements were derived from an actual FRAM reliability test and include opposite-state and new-same-state characteristics of the Si:HfO2 thin film. From the retention tests, the ferroelectric imprint characteristic of Si:HfO2 were extracted as well.

Due to these effects, at the beginning of the FRAM era, write endurance was limited to 104 - 107 cycles. These limitations were later overcome by the",140

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"from the fact that the capacitor was left in the positive polarization state at the end of a previous measurement sequence (pulse 14).. However, since polarization relaxation might have occurred during the retention time, the amount of relaxed polarization will be switched again as a response to pulse 11.. A quantification of the amount of relaxed polarization can be given by considering the current response to pulse 12.. This pulse succeeds after one second and should, if polarization relaxation occurred during the storage period, show a current response that is smaller in magnitude.. Moreover, it is likely that ferroelectric relaxation in the 12 pulse response is even reduced with respect to a virgin sample.. This 32 MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF FERROELECTRIC HFO2 originates from the fact that the positive polarization state will be favored after a certain period of storage time (called ""imprint"", see next section).. The third pulse of the first sequence switches to the negative polarization state whereas the current response to the negative voltage pulse will decrease over time.. This is again due to the favored positive polarization direction.. Hence, the opposite state cannot be switched properly anymore and the current response decreases.. This can then also be observed in the current response of the last pulse of that sequence which in turn also decreases since the negative polarization state was not brought into full saturation.. The same effects need to be considered for the pulse sequence applied to the second MFM capacitor.. The major difference is that a negative polarization state is set by the last pulse and henceforth maintained during storage.. Moreover, the additional pulse allows for the calculation of all parameters that are relevant for an FRAM read operation: First of all, the same-state (SS) retention parameter subtracts the current responses to pulse 21 and 11 in order to quantify a worst case read out margin for the positive polarization state.. The response to 21 will be affected by negative imprint which reduces the ferroelectric switching response.. The response to pulse 11 can be affected by ferroelectric relaxation which effectively increases the non-switching response.. Together, this reduces the overall read margin of the positive polarization state.. The new-same-state (NSS) retention parameter subtracts the response of pulse 23 from the one of 12.. The current response to pulse 23 will again be reduced due to negative polarization imprint.. The response to pulse 12 might be increased due to a reduced ferroelectric relaxation after positive polarization imprint has happened.. Hence, the NSS parameter represents the worst case read scenario after the polarization state of interest, in this case the positive one, has been read out once..",531

Furthermore, the difference between VC2 and VC1 (see Fig. 2-1), i.e. the width of the polarization hysteresis, decreased with increasing silicon concentration. For films of 30 nm and 50 nm thickness, the width of the antiferroelectric-like hysteresis increased. Moreover, the electric fields required for transitioning into the ferroelectric phase also rose with increasing film thickness. One remarkable property was revealed for samples 36 MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF FERROELECTRIC HFO2of 30 nm film thickness and 5.6 mol% silicon concentration: An almost ideally rectangular ferroelectric hysteresis was observed with a remanent polarization of approximately 2 C/cm2. Moreover, due to the well-shaped P-E hysteresis, almost no polarization relaxation was observed, i.e. the Pr to PS ratio was close to one. The origin of the reduced remanent polarization was in the past ascribed to a lower ferroelectric phase fraction due to the earlier onset of crystallization for thicker films [218]. Moreover, an off-polarization-axis texture of the film was also proposed in the past to be responsible for a reduction of the remanent polarization [55]. However, if this would be the case, also a higher coercive voltage would be expected due to the fact that only a fraction of the applied field projects onto the polarization axis. Since the coercive fields for the 5.6 mol% sample of 30 nm film thickness are still in the range of 1 MV/cm, the reduced ferroelectric phase fraction is assumed to be the cause for the reduction in P. With respect to the target application discussed in this thesis, i.e. the ferroelectric field effect transistor, low polarization and a high Pr to PS ratio are both in favor of the device. Hence, the observed hysteresis for 5.6 mol% silicon concentration and 30 nm film thickness will again be used to illustrate these effects for the FeFET in the next chapter. Nevertheless, the potential effect of a reduced ferroelectric phase fraction on device statistics has always to be kept in mind. 2.5Reference Capacitors for Integrated Device Lot The",487
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"that so far were presented in this chapter were based on Si:HfO2 thin films created by atomic layer deposition (ALD). More specifically it was mentioned, that metal-organic TEMAH and 4DMAS precursor gases were used for ALD processing. These precursor chemistries are specifically well suited for deposition of thin films into high aspect ratio geometries due to their extraordinary conformality. For planar device geometries it is however more common to use inorganic metal-halide precursor chemistries due to a larger process window and better particle performance. Hence, for the integrated FeFET device lots, the precursor gases were changed to HfCl4 and SiCl4 whereas the ozone oxidant was replaced by water. In order to verify that these ALD chemistries lead to the same ferroelectric behavior, MFM reference capacitors were processed before the actual device lot was later manufactured. The capacitors serve as a material reference in order to allow for a better interpretation of the FeFET performance (see chapter 4). In order to create the capacitors, a 10 nm TiN bottom electrode was first processed at 450 ºC/3 h using pulsed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and the precursor gases TiCl4 and NH3. Afterwards, the 10 nm Si:HfO2 layer was ALD processed whereas the pulse ratios were varied from 12:1 over 14:1 to 20:1. This ensured that a wide molar concentration range from 5.7 mol% over 4.5 mol% to 3.5 mol% could be covered. This was required since the MFM process window for inducing the ferroelectric properties was expected to change slightly with the integration into a CMOS device flow. The MFM capacitors were subsequently finalized by deposition of another TiN top electrode which was finally structured by a platinum hard mask. In the following, the",392

In order to predict device properties of FeFETs that are based on ferroelectric HfO2, a FeFET simulation model represents a viable tool. In the past, several compact models for first describing a ferroelectric hysteresis were established [41, 63, 93, 102, 155, 174, 175, 199-201]. These helped in creating FeFET simulation models which provided the link to the integrated circuit (IC) design. These compact models were later also implemented into commercial TCAD (Technology Computer Aided Design) software which provides the opportunity to create an even deeper physical device understanding. Within this chapter, the concept of the ferroelectric field effect transistor is explained in detail and supported by TCAD simulations performed with Sentaurus Device (Synopsis) [177]. First, the modeling of the ferroelectric hysteresis is briefly explained. Afterwards, the model is applied for simulating a 28 nm FeFET device geometry as it was manufactured during the course of this thesis. In combination with",365

The chapter concludes with the integration scheme of Si:HfO2 FeFETs in a standard HKMG process flow. Deviations from the standard flow are highlighted and a judgment regarding the capability FeFETs to serve as embedded memories is given. 3.1Compact Model of Ferroelectric Hysteresis In order to model the M-H characteristics for ferromagnetic materials, already in 1935, F. Preisach developed a mathematical approach to describe the hysteretic behavior [131]. The model assumes that the material which possesses hysteretic behavior can be described in terms of a summation of elementary hysteresis loops that have individual coercive fields and are weighed with respect to each other. By choosing the distribution of the coercive voltages respectively the weight of the elementary hysteresis loops appropriately, the macroscopic hysteresis observed in",227

Moreover, in order to avoid the numerically inefficient solution of the Preisach model, it was shown that a simplified mathematical approach based on a hyperbolic tangent function can be used [63]. This type of empirical description of hysteresis phenomena is known to be applicable also for ferroelectrics and is implemented within Sentaurus Device as follows [177]: ( ) ( () ( )) (3-1) The above formula gives an expression for the polarization P as a function of the electric field E. The history dependence of the hysteresis is expressed in the  sign whereas plus corresponds to decreasing and minus to increasing electric fields. Moreover, sub-loop states are encoded in the parameters c and Poff, which result from the most recent turning points of the hysteresis (a turning point is defined as the simulation step at which the electric field changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa). 39 THE SI:HFO2 FEFET: FROM TCAD MODEL TO INTEGRATED 28 NM DEVICEBesides the polarization P and the electric field E, there are several material specific constants that serve as input for the ferroelectric model: PS represents the spontaneous polarization, Ec the coercive field and Pr the remanent polarization.

Therefore, the hysteresis model was considered valid also with respect to Si:HfO2 and the parameterization was consequently used for the simulation of FeFET devices. 40 THE SI:HFO2 FEFET: FROM TCAD MODEL TO INTEGRATED 28 NM DEVICE3.2Application of the Ferroelectric Model for TCAD Simulation of FeFETs In order to perform TCAD device simulations for FeFET transistors, not only a valid hysteresis model, but also an appropriate FeFET device geometry is required. Therefore, TCAD environments in general provide two simulation categories: Process simulation and device simulation. The first category provides the possibility to model and simulate manufacturing processes like dopant implantation and thermal treatments. The result of a process simulation can for example be a transistor model that is subsequently used for device simulations (Fig. 3-2 (a) and (c)). In a device simulation, voltage or current boundary conditions are applied to the terminals of the device. Subsequently, numerical solutions of e.g. the drift-diffusion and continuity equations are calculated on a discrete mesh of the geometry (Fig. 3-2 (b)). Therefore, the Preisach-based description of the polarization hysteresis is part of the physical models that are used within the device simulation. The transistor geometry that was required for FeFET device simulations had been derived from a process simulation of a 28 nm HKMG logic transistor. It was furthermore adjusted with respect to implant variations and HfO2 film thickness as they occurred for actual FeFET test chips (see section 3.3). The TCAD geometry closely reflected the actual FeFET device geometry as confirmed by TEM micrographs of actual FeFETs (Fig. 3-2 (d)). a78bcCutlined5G623 4SBD130 nmFig. 3-2: 2D TCAD FeFET geometry and corresponding TEM micrograph.

In order to generate a theoretical understanding of the FeFET memory behavior, the general effect of ferroelectric polarization on the drain current characteristics of a FET is summarized. The first thorough theoretical treatment of the FeFET was given by Miller and McWhorter who also proposed a numerical procedure to account for the history dependence of the FeFET [102]. Afterwards, an illustrative approach based on charge conservation respectively Maxwell's first equation applied to the FeFET gate stack was given by Ullmann [199]. The most important findings of these studies are used to explain the concept of the ferroelectric field effect transistor. 41 THE SI:HFO2 FEFET: FROM TCAD MODEL TO INTEGRATED 28 NM DEVICEFirst of all, as mentioned in the",836
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,introduction,", the FeFET encodes its binary states in terms of a shifted threshold voltage. The threshold voltage of any MOSFET can be extracted from the drain current versus gate voltage (Id-Vg) characteristics. From the summation of drift and diffusion current in a semiconductor [178], the drain current along the channel direction x can be expressed as follows [102]: ⏞(3-2) where q represents the elementary charge, n the electron mobility, n the electron density, E the electric field and Dn the electron diffusion coefficient which equals ((kT/q)n). In order to understand the memory characteristics of the FeFET it is sufficient to operate the transistor in the linear regime, i.e. the contribution of the diffusion current to the total drain current can be neglected. Consequently, for a given electric field from drain to source, the current through an n-channel FET is determined by the minority carrier concentration n. Hence, this again shows that the memory characteristics of a FeFET, i.e. the parallel shift of the Id-Vg characteristics, are caused by controlling the minority carrier concentration. It shall be highlighted at this point that caution should be exercised when correlating the spontaneous polarization with this change in minority carrier concentration. As it will be shown in the course of this chapter, even though PS is required for a functional FeFET, the magnitude of the spontaneous polarization is however only of minor importance to the memory characteristics. What differentiates the FeFET from a standard MOSFET is that the silicon surface potential S is not only a function of the currently applied gate voltage but also depends on the history of the gate voltage. Due to the fact that the minority carrier concentration n is controlled by S [46], the ferroelectric history in turn controls the drain current. The interrelation of surface potential, ferroelectric polarization and gate voltage can be understood when applying Maxwell's first equation to the FeFET gate stack: SourceGateVGBVFE ( )( ( ) (3-3) (3-4) FerroelectricInsulatorVIF) (3-5) BulkSFig. 3-3: Equivalent circuit and physical description of an MFIS gate stack. The ferroelectric thin film is described as a parallel connection of dielectric and ferroelectric capacitors whereas the silicon bulk can be represented by a voltage controlled capacitance. It shall be mentioned that for simplicity, the flatband voltage is considered to be zero (no fixed charges or workfunction differences are considered). Equation (3-5) gives a relation between the applied gate to bulk voltage VGB, the polarization P (as a function of the electric field across the ferroelectric EFE) and the surface potential S. The surface charge density S is itself a function of the surface potential and can be derived by integration of Poisson's equation along the space charge region. The resulting expression 42 THE SI:HFO2 FEFET: FROM TCAD MODEL TO INTEGRATED 28 NM DEVICEthat links the surface charge density and the surface potential can be stated as follows [199]: ( )√ √ ( ( )) (3-6) where the signum function indicates that for a positive surface potential, the surface charge density of an NFET is negative. Moreover, NA represents the acceptor concentration in the silicon bulk, T the temperature voltage kT/q with k being Boltzmann's constant and F being the Fermi potential. Hence, by combining equation (3-6) and (3-5), the surface potential becomes a function of the applied gate voltage and ferroelectric polarization. However, the link from the surface potential / surface charge density to the electron density is still missing. For any FET device and to a first approximation, only the free charge carriers of the inversion layer can contribute to the current flow. Though, the surface charge density S includes both the contribution of the inversion layer as well as the contribution from the ionized acceptors. Since the ionized acceptors do not take part in current transport from drain to source, their contribution to S needs to be subtracted in order to derive n. For calculation of the surface charge density due to the ionized acceptors, it is possible to apply the so called charge-sheet approximation [178]. For this approximation it is assumed that the surface potential S completely drops across the depletion region. Using this assumption, it is possible to determine the width of the space charge region w and hence, conclude on the surface charge contribution of ionized acceptors: ⏞ √ √ (3-7) Equation (3-7) then finally gives the relation between electron density n and surface charge density / surface potential. Together with equation (3-5), the drain current can be calculated by integration of equation (3-2) from drain to source. In order to solve the mentioned set of equations and to account for the history dependence of the ferroelectric, numerical solutions as suggested e.g. in [102] can be applied. For the demonstration of FeFET device behavior, a TCAD environment as mentioned before could be used which inherently solves e.g. the drift-diffusion equation in a numerical manner. Combined with the compact model that was able to properly account for ferroelectric hysteresis (see section 3.1), FeFET device characteristics could be simulated in a comfortable fashion. 3.2.2Memory Window and Polarization Hysteresis The occurrence of the memory window (MW) represents the fundamental FeFET property enabling the storage of binary data. As described theoretically in the previous section, the memory window will be determined by the effect of polarization hysteresis on the surface potential. In order to illustrate this, the",1361

A quasistationary bipolar gate voltage sweep of decreasing amplitude was chosen in 43 THE SI:HFO2 FEFET: FROM TCAD MODEL TO INTEGRATED 28 NM DEVICEorder to maintain comparability to the MFM simulation. The triangular voltage signal was specified to decrease from a 10 V amplitude down to 0 V in increments of -1 V. During the gate voltage sweep, the drain voltage was kept at 0.1 V such that the FeFET was operated in the linear regime. a10Prg stateb10-3MW2P at VG=0V [µC/cm2]ErsPrg PrgP at VG=0V [µC/cm2] 2 6-1 1010 8-1 06 4 2 VT,Std-10 1010 30-3-68 6 0-3-6 4 0 VT [V] VT [V] 2 1 2 6 3VT [V]-10 -5 0 5 10 Sweep Range [V] 10 8 6 4 Sweep Range [V] 2 06 3 0-3-6P at VG=0V [µC/cm2]12VG [V]0P [µC/cm2]6 0-610-5 ID [A] 10-7-10Ers state10-901-12Time [a.u.]-1VG [V]VG [V]Sweep Range [V]Fig. 3-4: Quasistationary simulation",618

For the applied voltage sequence (Fig.. 3-4 (a)), a proper shift of the Id-Vg characteristics could be observed (Fig.. 3-4 (b)).. The maximum sweep range of  10 V led to a VT separation / memory window of approximately 1.8 V which decreased only slightly when the sweep range is incrementally reduced to  7 V (Fig.. 3-4 (d)).. For lower sweep ranges the memory window decreased more significantly, mainly triggered by a loss of the high-VT erased state.. This behavior was caused due to the fact that the transistor model possesses a gate stack specification in favor of the positive polarization, i.e.. the flatband voltage is negative.. Moreover, for the sweep section of 3 V to -2 V this led to the irreversibility of the polarization to negative values.. This finally resulted in a positive polarization at the end of the sweep sequence.. By analyzing the polarization characteristics more closely it becomes clear that the saturated polarization is only reached for rather high gate voltages, i.e.. at approximately 7 V (Fig.. 3-4 (c)).. This is a reasonable result since it corresponds to the point of maximum memory window.. That is, the memory window cannot grow beyond the point at which the saturated polarization is reached..

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,", the gate bias at which the EFE changes sign approximately also corresponds to the point at which P starts to decrease (see Fig. 3-6 (a)). However, for a higher Pr/PS ratio and larger coercive fields this will not be the case, i.e. there will be a region of zero polarization loss after the point at which EFE changes sign. These characteristics become even more important when so called ""disturb"" signals appear in a FeFET array that additionally increase depolarization (see section 5.3.1). By comparing the EFE-VG characteristics of the FeFET to a non-ferroelectric transistor, again the EFE reduction due to the continuity in D is revealed. Vice versa, the increase in EIF due to the ferroelectric polarization is shown in Fig. 3-6 (c). Moreover, for the EIF-VG hysteresis, the orientation is counterclockwise and at zero gate bias, EIF is of inverse polarity as compared to EFE. In total it can be stated that the interfacial field stress is more than ten times the electric field across the ferroelectric. Hence, for saturated memory operation above five volts, EIF will exceed 20 MV/cm which is known to lead to a hard dielectric breakdown [24]. Another common approach to visualize both the memory characteristics and depolarization fields is to plot the gate stack band diagram at different gate voltages (Fig. 3-7). 46 THE SI:HFO2 FEFET: FROM TCAD MODEL TO INTEGRATED 28 NM DEVICE15GHfO2Si615-10-15-5 0 10541042E/q [V]5 0-520SiON0-2-2-4-10Cutline [a.u.]-4-6-15-6-8Cutline [a.u.]Cutline [a.u.]Cutline [a.u.]Fig. 3-7: FeFET band diagram during erase, program and retention periods.

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,experiment,"al findings, certain phenomena were discovered that are detrimental to memory operation. For the given device geometry, implant conditions and interfacial layer properties, depolarization to  4.4 C/cm2 was observed even for fully saturated memory operation. Moreover, for a FeFET, the rather high spontaneous polarization value of 9.5 C/cm2 led to the retarded onset of MW saturation and also to severe interfacial field stress. In order to reduce the observed detrimental effects, one approach is to tailor the Si:HfO2 ferroelectric properties such that the spontaneous polarization is reduced. This had already been observed for thicker Si:HfO2 films [218], in particular for the 30 nm Si:HfO2 layers presented in section 2.4. The difference as compared to 10 nm films was explained in terms of an earlier onset of crystallization due to the increased film thickness. In turn, it was indicated that the ferroelectric phase fraction for 30 nm films will be lower and hence, the spontaneous polarization was reduced. Moreover, almost no polarization relaxation was observed. Therefore, modeling the PS and Pr value with 2.005 C/cm2 and 2 C/cm2 led to a good agreement of",267

Moreover, for 30 nm films both the coercive field as well as the dielectric constant were reduced to 0.9 MV/cm and 25 respectively. By increasing the HfO2 thickness in the TCAD model and utilization of the mentioned material parameters, the voltage sequence shown in Fig. 3-4 (a) was again simulated for the modified FeFET.

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"from the lower spontaneous polarization, the lower dielectric permittivity as well as from the higher Pr/PS ratio of the 30 nm ferroelectric. Accordingly, the electric fields across ferroelectric and interface layer are almost identical to the ones occurring for a non-ferroelectric FET (Fig. 3-8 (d) and (e)). Hence, better reliability of the interface layer as well as better retention due to reduced Edep (see also Fig. 3-8 (f)) can be anticipated for FeFETs utilizing tailored Si:HfO2 films. Anyhow, from an application perspective, a deeper understanding of the altered ferroelectric properties with increasing film thickness is required. The mentioned reduction of the ferroelectric phase fraction, which potentially causes the lower PS, might be detrimental with respect to statistical effects. In order to create a more general understanding on how to optimize FeFETs, an illustrative approach based on Maxwell's first equation can be utilized [199]. That is, the continuity of the electric displacement field can be expressed in terms of operating points on the charge versus gate voltage (Q-VG) characteristics for ferroelectric and semiconductor insulator region. Therefore, the operating points are defined as the intersection of the ferroelectric hysteresis and the section-wise defined insulator-semiconductor load line (Fig. 3-9). 48 THE SI:HFO2 FEFET: FROM TCAD MODEL TO INTEGRATED 28 NM DEVICEQVFEVIS1IS load lineVG2VGFig. 3-9: Graphical derivation of the FeFET operating points. The corresponding triangular gate voltage signal is given as inset. Operating points are defined by the intersection of ferroelectric Q-VFE hysteresis and insulator-semiconductor (IS) load line (kinked line). The depolarization is visualized at zero gate bias by the position of the operating point on the high capacitance slope of the ferroelectric. (1) and (2) illustrate the difference between analytically derived and actually remaining depolarization field Edep when depolarization has already occurred. By utilizing both the ferroelectric Q-V hysteresis and the insulator-semiconductor load line, several phenomena occurring in FeFET devices can be understood in an illustrative manner. For example, the occurrence of the depolarization field is visualized by the non-zero ferroelectric and insulator-semiconductor voltage for operating points at zero gate bias. Moreover, the difference between the analytically derived depolarization field (see equation (3-10)) and Edep at zero gate bias (e.g. Fig. 3-6) is highlighted by numerals (1) and (2) in Fig. 3-9. Furthermore, the loadline in inversion and accumulation solely reflects the interfacial capacitance which is common to all MOSFETs. Hence, just from a geometric point of view it can be concluded that a larger slope, i.e. a higher IF, can reduce Edep. Consequently, the graphical representation of the charge neutrality in the gate stack represents a feasible approach to create an understanding of the optimization potential for FeFETs. This is now exemplified in terms of changing the ferroelectric material parameters and a comparison is drawn with respect to the",754

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,experiment,"s, the coercive field can also be varied in a relatively wide range mainly depending on the type of dopant that is used [114]. This justifies the analysis of Ec as an additional material parameter. Simulations show that the largest memory window for the given parameter set is achieved by coercive fields in the range of 1.2 - 1.5 MV/cm. However, also polarization saturation monotonically decreases, that is, for higher coercive fields, the 5 V sweep range is not sufficient. Due to the reduced Pmax and subloop operation, the interfacial field stress is of course reduced but potentially at the cost of retention loss. In a last step, the dielectric constant of the interface layer and its effect on the FOPs was analyzed. In general, by increasing the dielectric constant of the interface layer, the voltage divider of the stack changes in favor of the ferroelectric which effectively reduces the required operational voltages. This is also reflected in the growth of MW in Fig. 3-11 which saturates around 1.7 V and is limited by the width of the ferroelectric hysteresis. Furthermore, the polarization saturates at PS and the interfacial field stress is continuously reduced. More interestingly, the ratio of P0 to Pmax first decreases due to the increase in Pmax but then stays constant independent of the dielectric constant of the interface layer. Hence, the main driving force for depolarization is not the interface layer but rather the low 51 THE SI:HFO2 FEFET: FROM TCAD MODEL TO INTEGRATED 28 NM DEVICEcapacitance of the depletion region in the bulk. Accordingly, by increasing the bulk doping level it is possible to reduce the depolarization and therefore improve retention [41]. This has to be considered as a viable approach for FeFET optimization if additional lithography masks can be used for a dedicated FeFET well implant (see also section 3.3 for additional integration related topics). Up to this point,",429
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,experiment,"s and single parameter variations were presented that illustrate how the FeFET can be optimized. It was e.g. found that a smaller spontaneous polarization can be advantageous with respect to Edep / EIF,max and that IF is actually not the quantity that will affect retention the most. However, due to the rather complex non-linear behavior of the ferroelectric, together with a certain amount of FOPs, the actual interrelation between all parameters is non-obvious. Besides the FOPs, the variation of material parameters, i.e. the input parameters of the simulation, leading to a change in the FOPs also has to be judged with respect to their actual feasibility. As an example, the permittivity of the interface layer might be increased with a higher amount of nitrogen in the layer which however causes a higher density of traps and therefore leads to reliability issues. Accordingly, so called ""Figures of Feasibility"" (FOF) are introduced in addition which shall account for the real world feasibility of parameter variations. The combination of FOPs and FOFs then gives the figure of merit (FOM), i.e. a realistic measure of the optimization potential of a technology that is characterized by a complex set of variables. During the course of this study, three FOPs as well as three FOFs were chosen to identify the most appropriate parameter set for an optimized FeFET operation. Therefore, the FOPs and FOFs were weighed first according to the requirement of an NVM application (Tab. 3-1). Tab. 3-1: Weighing of figures of performance and feasibility.

These give a measure of the general memory margin and also of potential endurance and retention characteristics of the FeFET respectively. As mentioned before, selected input parameters can be chosen to define the FOFs, in this case, the spontaneous polarization and the dielectric constant of the ferroelectric and the interface layer. As an example, there were three different implementations of the spontaneous polarization which were weighed according to their feasibility: Even though a low PS value of 3 C/cm2 is advantageous with respect to the FOPs (see also previous paragraphs in the subsection), its feasibility is diminished due to the potential impact on device statistics. On the other hand, a very high PS value of 40 is more likely since it is closer to the theoretically predicted spontaneous polarization [27]. However, it is still not as likely as the most commonly observed",718
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,experiment,"al values of around 15. Accordingly, the three different implementations of PS obtain the weights 0, 1 and 2 respectively. Similar to the weighing of PS, variations in the permittivity of both the ferroelectric and the interfacial layer were classified accordingly. 52 THE SI:HFO2 FEFET: FROM TCAD MODEL TO INTEGRATED 28 NM DEVICEBesides these three input parameters that served as FOFs, the gate voltage (3 V, 5 V or 7 V), the thickness of the ferroelectric (10 nm, 20 nm or 30 nm) as well as the coercive field (0.5 MV/cm, 1 MV/cm or 2 MV/cm) were chosen as additional variable simulation parameters. Due to the fact that the variation of these input parameters was not considered critical, they were excluded from the FOFs. Based on the given parameter set and the defined weights of the FOPs and FOFs, a design of simulations was set up and carried out in order to derive an understanding on the optimization potential of the FeFET. The parameter combinations resulting in the highest FOM value are summarized in Tab. 3-2. Tab. 3-2:",260

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,experiment,"lead to large depolarization, i.e. a zero weight for the P0 to PS ratio. This can be ascribed to the sub-loop operation for the given parameter set and will most likely result in degraded retention characteristics. Moreover, the parameter sets e) and f) are able to improve the sum of FOPs, however at the price of reduced feasibility. That is, the main parameter responsible for the improvement, i.e. the high IF of 32, does not seem viable from a real world perspective. Furthermore, from an NVM viewpoint, all six simulations are not able to lift the P0 to PS ratio significantly above 0.5. Hence, the classical retention problem should remain also for HfO2-based FeFET devices. The only way to increase P0 / PS (under the assumption that the substrate doping is fixed) is given by a lower PS value. However, this might have detrimental effects from a statistical viewpoint which is why the weight for PS = 3 was chosen as 0 (see Tab. 3-1). Concluding it shall be stated that for a different target application, like e.g. a volatile memory application, the weights of the FOPs and FOFs has to be changed. If the FeFET should for example be used as a DRAM replacement [50], a P0 to PS ratio of close to one is only of secondary importance. On the other hand, the Eox,max FOP will gain in importance due to the requirement that the FeFET has to endure an infinite amount of write cycles. In summary, there is always a trade-off between device performance and technical feasibility to consider. Judging FeFET simulations in terms of weighted FOPs and FOFs represents a practical approach to derive the application specific material and device design requirements. 53 THE SI:HFO2 FEFET: FROM TCAD MODEL TO INTEGRATED 28 NM DEVICE3.3FeFET Integration into a 28 nm Technology Node During the course of this thesis it was possible to demonstrate for the first time that, by use of ferroelectric Si:HfO2, FeFET devices can be scaled down to a 28 nm technology node (see chapter 4). This achievement was made possible by the proven CMOS compatibility of HfO2 as a gate dielectric. Other FeFET approaches that are based on classical ferroelectrics like SBT or PZT are either not integratable as dense arrays [70] or show device sizes in the m-range [221]. 28 nm Si:HfO2 ferroelectric field effect transistors on the other hand offer integration densities that might finally enable a competitive FeFET NVM solution in the future. Moreover, besides the CMOS compatibility of HfO2, the fact that the changes to a standard CMOS process flow are kept at a minimum further improves the viability of the HfO2 FeFET. In order to illustrate the ease of integration for the underlying FeFET concept, this section will first briefly summarize the process flow for a 28 nm HKMG technology.

This was enabled by the higher dielectric constant of HfO2 (r 20) as compared to SiO2 which suffers from an r of only 3.9.. Moreover, the traditional gate electrode was supplemented by a TiN metal that solved i.a.. the issue of poly depletion.. Accordingly, the HKMG technology has become the de facto standard especially for cutting edge low-power and high performance applications..

That is, by connecting several transistors in parallel, devices that are performing extraordinarily well can for example dominate the electrical Id-Vg characteristics (Fig. 4-1). aFETFETTbVGcVGTDUT 1 FETDUT 3 FENIDIDFEDUT 2 NTDUT 4 FEFEFEN100 % FE75 % FE / 25 % T100 % Neutral (N)50 % FE / 50 % T100 % Trapping (T)25 % FE / 75 % TFig. 4-1: Statistical effects in FeFET multi-structures.

(b) Drain current versus gate voltage characteristic of a theoretical FeFET multi-structure for different degrees of proper functionality (log-scale). Constant current VT criterion is shown as dotted line. (c) Linear plot of the drain current characteristic. As it was stated in chapter 1, ferroelectric HfO2 is a polycrystalline thin film right at the crystallographic phase boundary between monoclinic and tetragonal / cubic. It was furthermore shown [218] that the films can possess different amounts of orthorhombic phase fraction which is supposed to be responsible for the ferroelectric nature of the material. 60 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SI:HFO2-BASED FEFETS Hence, Fig. 4-1 (a) illustrates this fact by four DUTs that are located on an HfO2 film (which is of course structured by an RIE in reality). The film possesses various areas of different crystallographic phase. The effect on an Id-Vg characteristic plotted in log-scale is shown in Fig. 4-1 (b). The characteristics are always sums of 100 DUTs connected in parallel whereas the threshold voltage of each individual device is either shifted by 1V (trapping (T) and ferroelectric (FE) switching respectively) or kept for a neutral (N) device. This corresponds to the expected VT shift occurring for a positive gate pulse, i.e. ferroelectric switching to the low-VT state or parasitic electron trapping from the channel leading to a high-VT state. Since a neutral device is unlikely to exist after a program pulse (large interfacial field stress during programming, see section 3.2.3), special attention is brought to the superposition of various amounts of FE and T transistors. In the logarithmic scale, even for the case that only a minority of transistors (25 %) shows ferroelectric behavior, the Id-Vg characteristic is dominated by these. This is a simple artifact from plotting the sum of Id-Vg characteristics logarithmically which can however cause confusion when e.g. extracting the threshold voltage using a constant current criterion [61]. On a linear scale (Fig. 4-1 (c)) the difference between the different fractions of ferroelectric and trapping effect becomes more evident. There is a clear kink in the characteristic when the devices that are prone to trapping add to the already fully conducting ferroelectric devices. Hence, for a better quantification of statistical effects on multi-structures, different VT criterions like the extrapolated threshold voltage / maximum gm criterion [61] should be used. As an example, for a superposition of ferroelectric and trapping devices there will be multiple local maxima occurring in the gm plot. These can be compared in their magnitudes in order to draw",874

For a more qualitative analysis of basic memory characteristics like program / erase endurance and switching kinetics, a simple constant current criterion suffices.. In this chapter, many of the device parameters are extracted based on a constant current VT criterion because it resembles the basic device performance.. In chapter 6 however, focus will again shift towards statistical effects.. 4.2Basic Electrical Characteristics Standard electrical transistor characterization can be applied to visualize the main memory effects occurring for FeFET devices.. The binary state storage essential for realizing a memory device is represented by the flatband voltage shift which in turn shifts the Id-Vg characteristics of the device.. This can be analyzed either by capacitance-voltage (C-V) or by drain-current / gate-voltage (Id-Vg) measurements.. Similar to PUND measurements for MFM capacitors, the transient characteristics of the program and erase operations leading to the flatband / threshold voltage shift were measured by a program / erase matrix.. Memory specific measurements were performed in a similar fashion as it was presented in section 0, only that the state determining parameter is represented by the threshold voltage of the FeFET.. 4.2.1Capacitance- and Current-Voltage Characteristics In order to quantify e.g.. the amount of fixed or trapped charges inside gate oxides, capacitance voltage (C-V) measurements are often used to determine the shift in flatband voltage and thereby to calculate the quantity of interest, e.g.. the density of trapped charges [153].. For the FeFET, C-V measurements can be used to quantify the flatband voltage shift caused by different polarization states [51].. 61 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SI:HFO2-BASED FEFETS For C-V characterization, a DC-bias is ramped at the transistor bulk, source and drain terminals (high-side) whereas a small signal AC sine modulation is superimposed on top.. The gate is connected to the low-side where AC current flow and again the AC voltage response to the excitation are measured.. Hence, the DUT impedance including the capacitance can be calculated [170, 204].. By choosing the sweep range to be wide enough, all areas of transistor operation can be covered (accumulation, depletion and (strong) inversion)..",499

The gate terminal of the FeFET multi-structure was pulsed from -5V to 5V (and back) in incremental steps of 50 mV with 200 s pulses (full width at half maximum, FWHM), rise and fall times of 100 s and a delay of 100 s with respect to the drain pulse. The drain terminal was pulsed synchronously at constant 100 mV amplitude. 63 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SI:HFO2-BASED FEFETSDrain Current [A]1E-023.5 mol%-4PEID44.5 mol%PEID45.7 mol%PEID4VGS1E-041E-061E-081E-10-6-202VGS-4-202VGS-4-202-6-66VGS [V]VGS [V]VGS [V]Fig. 4-3: Ramped pulse Id-Vg characteristics for FeFET devices. The Si:HfO2 systems which possessed a remanent polarization already in the MFM structure (3.5 mol% and 4.5 mol%) showed a ferroelectric shift of the threshold voltage (counterclockwise hysteresis). The transistors incorporating the antiferroelectric composition (5.7 mol%) revealed a clockwise hysteresis. Id-Vg characteristics on a linear scale are shown as inset. Similar to what has been observed for the MFIS C-V characterization, FeFET devices with 3.5 mol% and 4.5 mol% silicon concentration showed a VT shift to smaller values when the gate voltage was swept back from positive to negative voltages (Fig. 4-3 left). As for C-V-characterization, this is a clear indicator for ferroelectric behavior since charge trapping from the channel region would provoke a VT shift into the opposite direction. For the Si:HfO2 systems possessing remanence (3.5 mol% and 4.5 mol%), the inspection of the Id-Vg characteristics on a linear scale reveals a crossing of the backward and forward trace of the sweep. This had been observed in the past [13] and was correlated to trapped charges at the interface from SiON to bulk. Identical to what has been mentioned for C-V characterization, the interfacial field stress is furthermore enhanced with increasing remanent polarization (see subsection 3.2.4). This might be the root cause of the stronger drain current degradation for the 3.5 mol% composition as compared to the 4.5 mol% composition. By referring back to section 4.1, it is however reasonable to assume that the crossing of the Id-Vg characteristics might also be caused by statistical variation between the DUTs connected in parallel. That is, some of the 50 FeFETs do not properly switch in a ferroelectric manner but are more prone to trapping. The most promising way in order to separate effects from statistical variation and intrinsic device performance is seen in the analysis of single memory cells (see chapter 6). The Si:HfO2 system with the highest silicon content of 5.7 mol% showed, analogous to the C-V",905
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,", pure trapping behaviour. The Id-Vg characteristics were clockwise and crossing of the Id-Vg characteristic on the linear scale was not observed. In total, both C-V as well as Id-Vg characterization revealed that the pure material properties of the three different Si:HfO2 systems could well transfer to the MFIS structures. However, some phenomena could not be described unambiguously and therefore additional characterization approaches were applied. 4.2.2Memory Window and Program / Erase Matrices The threshold voltage shift of an n-type FeFET is oppositely oriented as compared to charge trapping based devices and is therefore parasitically influenced when charge trapping occurs. Especially for HKMG stacks, charge trapping can show very fast kinetics which counteracts the ferroelectric VT shift even in the microsecond regime [90]. In order to 64 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SI:HFO2-BASED FEFETS properly evaluate the memory performance of FeFETs, the most appropriate operating conditions that are able to minimize trapping effects have to be found first. Therefore, so called program / erase matrices have to be acquired before more memory specific tests are carried out. In order to create these matrices, a sequence of write pulses and measurements is performed: First a reference pulse of fixed amplitude and pulse width is applied to the transistor gate while source, drain and bulk terminals are grounded. Depending on the polarity of the pulse, positive or negative, the FeFET is either written into the programmed (low-VT) or erased (high-VT) state. Then, an Id-Vg characteristic is measured in order to determine the reference threshold voltage. Afterwards, a pulse of opposite polarity, i.e. negative or positive, is applied whereas the amplitude and pulse width are parameters that are varied for each measurement sequence. The last part of each measurement sequence is again represented by an Id-Vg sweep that reads the threshold voltage. Hence, a program matrix is created if the parameterized pulse is of positive polarity and an erase matrix is generated when the parameterized pulse is negative. As an example, a matrix for 5 different pulse widths and 5 different amplitudes",476

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"for 10 s pulses. 67 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SI:HFO2-BASED FEFETSFor the program matrix of 500 nm long channel devices (Fig. 4-5 (a)), there is an almost instantaneous increase in memory window when the programming voltage is higher than 2.5 - 3 V. In addition, for erase voltages less than 3.5 V in absolute magnitude, no memory window can be observed which means that the programmed state cannot be switched back to a high VT erased state. In total it can be stated that for the program matrix, the memory window is rather constant in the program / erase area enclosed by the intervals of [-4 V; -6 V] and [+3 V; +6 V]. The largest memory window is observed for 3.8 V program and -5.6 V erase voltage. In order for the erase matrix to look similar to the program matrix, all 50 FeFET devices would have to possess identical program / erase characteristics and cumulative trapping effects must not affect the measurement. It was already pointed out in the previous sections that this is a very unlikely situation and it is again reflected in the constant pulse width erase matrix for the 500 nm devices (Fig. 4-5 (b)): As an example, for a program voltage of 4.4 V, the memory window grows from 0 V at -3 V erase pulse amplitude to 0.8 V at -5.2 V erase pulse amplitude. This wide range of 2.2 V for increasing the memory window by 800 mV cannot be seen for the respective program matrix. There, for the same memory window growth of 800 mV at 4.4 V program amplitude only a 0.6 V erase pulse range needs to be covered. This clearly illustrates the asymmetry between constant pulse width program and erase matrix. The shape of both program and erase matrix is more or less retained also for the 100 nm and 30 nm channel length devices (Fig. 4-5 (c)-(f)). However, the overall memory window decreases and the voltages required for erasing a device increase in amplitude. Not much can be concluded with respect to the program voltage, only that, from a statistical point of view, even for the smallest FeFET geometries there are still devices programming at around 4 V. These will dominate both program and erase characteristic making non-switched devices invisible inside the program / erase matrices. Since varying the pulse width would add a fourth dimension to the program / erase matrices,",537

There it can be seen that the overall memory window size can be increased by approximately 0.2 V and that the program and erase voltages shift to smaller amplitudes. This is in accordance to what is expected from the switching dynamics of the ferroelectric material itself (see section 2.2).4.2.3Endurance and Fatigue One of the most important characteristics for non-volatile as well as for volatile memory technologies is represented by its program / erase endurance. For the FeFET in particular this represents the ability to alternatingly shift the Id-Vg characteristic to the low-VT and back to the high-VT state without degrading the device performance. There are several effects that can negatively influence memory characteristics and lead to a non-functional device in the long run: Charge injection by trapping, which can also lead to interface degradation and consequently to gate stack break down, and ferroelectric fatigue are the most relevant for ferroelectric field effect transistors. The endurance characteristics of long channel as well as short channel devices were analyzed by stressing FeFET devices with bipolar  5 V / 10 s pulses [118]. Based on the",275

Moreover, 68 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SI:HFO2-BASED FEFETS the conditions were not expected to lead to immediate device degradation due to e.g. charge injection.

Long channel (top) and short channel devices (bottom) as well as all available Si:HfO2 compositions from (a) 3.5 mol% to (b) 4.5 mol% and (c) 5.7 mol% were tested. The red Id-Vg characteristic represents the programmed state whereas the blue one represents the erased state. Interestingly, the Si:HfO2 system with 3.5 mol% silicon concentration shows a quite different behaviour as it was expected from quasi-static Id-Vg measurements in section 4.2.1: Whereas in section 4.2.1 there was a proper VT-shift visible for the hysteretic sweep, this is not the case for neither the long nor the short channel FeFET devices of the mentioned silicon concentration. Looking at the Id-Vg characteristics and considering statistical variations between the devices, it appears as if some devices do not shift properly to a high-VT state after the erase operation (kink in the Id-Vg characteristic). Only after approximately 100 endurance cycles, proper VT separation between the programmed (red) and erased (blue) state is visible. For the quasi-static measurement, a proper memory window was visible already for virgin devices. Even though the devices in section 4.2.1 were 69 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SI:HFO2-BASED FEFETSmuch wider (W = 2 m), the total width (the product of the number of DUTs and the single device width) was approximately the same (100 m and 108 m respectively). Hence, neglecting additional geometric effects (e.g. the channel length / the device area) it appears that silicon concentrations which produce ferroelectric DC characteristics but appear to be slightly off-target (in this case 3.5 mol%) need either to be exposed to AC or DC stress in order to show proper VT separation of the written states. Moreover it can be seen that the programmed Id-Vg characteristics for both long channel as well as short channel devices of 3.5 mol% and 4.5 % silicon concentration differ quite a bit. Especially for gate voltages larger than VT, the Id-Vg slope of 3.5 mol% devices is rather flat compared to 4.5 mol% devices. Considering again statistical variations between the 300 FeFETs which are connected in parallel, devices which are in a weak program state can cause the flattening of the Id-Vg characteristics. If all devices would switch in a uniform manner, the Id-Vg characteristics would shift in parallel (see",1187

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"from section 4.2.1, the VT-shift is solely driven by charge trapping.. For short channel devices, the subthreshold slope, i.e.. the inverse slope of the Id-Vg graph for voltages less than VT, is in general significantly smaller due to short channel effects [178].. Hence, this is also the case for the FeFET transistors with 30 nm channel length.. However, for the ferroelectric concentrations of 3.5 mol% and 4.5 mol% it is evident that the slopes of programmed and erased Id-Vg characteristics differ significantly.. This characteristic is most pronounced for DUTs with 3.5 mol% silicon content.. Speaking in terms of statistical variation, the flattened Id-Vg characteristics might be due to weak programming of single transistors.. Furthermore this behaviour is in accordance with the trends seen for program / erase matrix characterization: There, both memory window degradation and an increase in erase pulse amplitude were observed for the smallest device geometries (see section 4.2.2).. Nevertheless, subthreshold slope degradation due to charge trapping cannot be ruled out.. If intrinsic device degradation would cause the low-VT subthreshold slope degradation, then the 3.5 mol% composition can be declared as more prone to this degradation than the 4.5 mol% composition.. This would again confirm the assumption that interface degradation can be related to the degree of polarization occurring for a specific material composition.. Furthermore, during the course of program / erase cycling, the VT shift for the 5.7 mol% Si:HfO2 system changes from approximately 1 V due to trapping to almost 0 V. Besides the in general inverted VT shift as compared to the ferroelectric concentrations, also the evolution of the VT shift with cycling is inverted.. One possible explanation might lie in the cycling induced growth of remanent polarization for this specific silicon concentration (see subsection 2.5).. Though, the actual quantity responsible for the occurrence of a discernable memory window, i.e.. the coercive field, cannot be considered large enough for that composition.. Besides this ambiguity, it is furthermore interesting to see that the closing of the trap window with cycling shifts the programmed and erased Id-Vg characteristics rather ideally parallel.. This suggests that all devices connected in parallel are affected by this field cycling phenomenon in a similar manner.. Nevertheless, all Si:HfO2 systems and their respective Id-Vg characteristics degrade after 105 endurance cycles..",503

Three different multi-structures were tested (Lg = 40 nm, 100 nm and 2 m; for all devices W = 2 m) whereas the number of devices connected in parallel varied such that the total device area was constant at 2,000 m2 (25,000, 10,000 or 500 devices in parallel). All three Si:HfO2 compositions were tested in order to extend the understanding about the transferability of pure MFM material characteristics to the integrated lot. Pulses of 5 V and 10 s slope and pulse width were used in order to maintain comparability to endurance measurements (see subsection 4.2.3). Furthermore, the delay time between the four PUND pulses was varied from 10 s to 1 s in order to investigate time dependent effects from e.g. ferroelectric relaxation or charge trapping. In between each PUND sequence, bipolar 5 V stress cycles possessing the same slope and pulse width as the PUND pulses were applied. 72 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SI:HFO2-BASED FEFETS PUND pulse seq. w/ 10 us delay3.5 mol%4.5 mol%5.7 mol%PUND pulse seq. w/ 1 s delay3.5 mol%4.5 mol%5.7 mol%Initial105 cyclesInitial105 cyclesFig. 4-8: PUND measurements for MFIS capacitors (Lg = 40 nm; W = 2 m; 25,000 DUTs in parallel).

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"of PUND characterization for short channel (Lg = 40 nm) devices are shown in Fig. 4-8. For the 5.7 mol% composition, the short delays of 10 s (left) led to a P and U current response that was not expected for the antiferroelectric composition: For an ideal antiferroelectric and independent of the pulse polarity, the ferroelectric displacement current on the rising edge should be exactly the inverse of the one occurring on the falling edge. However, on the falling edge of the P pulse no such current peak is visible. Only the slightly increasing negative current amplitude when the P pulse returns to 0V suggests ferroelectric relaxation as it is known from MFM capacitors (see subsection 0). However, in order for the relaxation assumption to be valid, the U pulse would have to show the inverted transient characteristic on the rising edge as compared to the falling edge of the P pulse. That is, the current magnitude would have to be larger at the beginning of the slope (the relaxed polarization switches again) than at the end of the slope. Given that in subsection 4.2.1 and 4.2.3 it was shown that this Si:HfO2 composition led to a significant trapping window for transistor devices, a charge injection related origin of the current peak should not be ruled out. There are various scenarios that can be hypothesized (charge injection into a trap band with succeeding gate voltage shielding, interface trapping etc.) and in depth charge trapping analyses should resolve these ambiguities in the future. For the N pulse and for a virgin device, two humps in the current response are visible whereas the second is just rising at -5 V. This suggests that for more negative amplitudes an additional current peak would occur. A sole increase of leakage current is unlikely since the D pulse should then show similar characteristics. This will become even clearer when considering",395
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"of the measurements utilizing one second delay time. With reference to section 4.2, the 4.5 mol% composition is considered to be predominantly ferroelectric. This is in general also reflected in the PUND measurements using a short delay time: That is, the P pulse shows a large current peak, the U pulse a predominantly dielectric response, the N pulse again a current peak response and finally the D pulse a perfectly dielectric displacement current. Some phenomena however require certain attention: First of all, the magnitudes of the respective P and N pulse current response are significantly different in size. Assuming that detrapping is negligible in the microsecond regime, the difference between P and N pulse shows that a charge injection 73 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SI:HFO2-BASED FEFETSeffect has to be superimposed on the ferroelectric switching. Independent of any gate stack asymmetry or ferroelectric imprint, the ferroelectric switching current has to be symmetric because it was shown that the Si:HfO2 hysteresis is of Preisach-type (see chapter 3). Hence, this also indicates that in the microsecond regime, the amount of electrons trapped during the P pulse cannot be fully detrapped by the N pulse. Moreover, with cyling it appears that the peak of the P pulse current response on the one hand grows and also shifts to higher gate voltages. The effects observed during cycling will be discussed in more detail in the next paragraphs. The 3.5 mol% composition shows switching behaviour similar to the 4.5 mol% composition. This is reasonable since the material system also showed a ferroelectric memory window during the Id-Vg analysis (see subsection 4.2.1 and 4.2.3). Nevertheless, the absolute value of the P pulse current response is significantly smaller, especially after cycling. On the other hand, the one for the N pulse is even larger as compared to the 4.5 mol% composition. After 105 endurance cycles, the point at which memory window degradation was observed in subsection 4.2.3, also the leakage current for positive gate voltages increases. However, this leaves the question why there is also memory window degradation occurring for the 4.5 mol% concentration whereas the increase in leakage current is not as severe as for the 3.5 mol% concentration. This will also become clearer when the cycling induced degradation is discussed in detail during the next paragraphs. During the analysis it became clear that the PUND characterization of the MFIS structures is not at all as straightforward as it was the case for MFM capacitors. Summarizing the observations made for the MFIS structures, the compositions that lead to a ferroelectric memory window (3.5 mol% and 4.5 mol%) and the one that does not (5.7 mol%) can be distinguished as follows: The magnitude of the P pulse response appears to influence the quality of the Id-Vg characteristics. The 4.5 mol% composition shows the largest current response and possesses a ferroelectric Id-Vg memory window straight from the beginning (see section 4.2.3). Since the 3.5 mol% composition and the 5.7 mol% compositions both possess a P pulse response approximately equal in size, the absolute value of the current response is not a sufficient criterion to determine proper functionality of FeFET devices. The property that clearly distinguishes the high and low silicon content compositions is the shape of the N pulse response: Whereas for the 3.5 mol% composition there is a distinct current peak occurring, for the 5.7 mol% sample this is not the case. In order to broaden the understanding of transient effects affecting the MFIS and therefore the FeFET characterization, the delay time between each PUND pulse was increased to one second. This led to the discovery of several phenomena: For all compositions, the U pulse response then looked very similar to the P pulse response, i.e. a current peak was visible. This can again either be explained by ferroelectric relaxation during the one second delay period or by detrapping of electrons that were captured during the P pulse. However, it is clear that the magnitude of the U pulse current response is much smaller as compared to the P pulse response. This is most prominent for the virgin device state and the 3.5 mol% and 4.5 mol% composition. For these two compositions the N pulse response also shows significantly reduced current peak amplitudes. Assuming that for short delay times the ferroelectric N pulse response is superimposed by a detrapping portion, this might be an explanation why for longer delay times the absolute magnitude of the current response decreases. For the 5.7 mol% composition, the previously observed (10 s delay) first hump in the N pulse current response disappears for one second delay time. This suggests that also this portion of the current response might be correlated to detrapping of electrons. 74 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SI:HFO2-BASED FEFETS In order to visualize the cycling and delay time induced effects, the current response of the P and U pulse as well as of the N and D pulse were subtracted from each other. For an MFM capacitor this is sometimes referred to as the switched polarization PSW. However, for the MFIS structure this might not be an appropriate denomination since, as it was discussed, trapping effects are likely to be superimposed on the ferroelectric response. The resulting current differences for the rising slopes of the P and U pulse and for the falling slopes of the N and D pulse are shown in Fig. 4-9 (the plotted time range is always 10 s).

As indicated in the last paragraph, the N-D difference shows two current peaks whereas the second one does not reach its maximum at -5 V. However, a delay time of one second more or less eliminates both current responses. Hence, no remanence, neither ferroelectric nor trapping related, can be expected after a certain period of time. The 4.5 mol% composition shows a much more pronounced P-U response which also remains clearly visible after one second delay time. What is revealed by increasing the delay time and subtracting P and U response is that the total magnitude of the P-U response shrinks with cycling. This cannot be seen in the",187

There, only an increase in current response accompanied with a shift to larger switching voltages can be recognized. The shift in switching voltage is also visible for one second delay time, however the decreasing P-U amplitude with cycling suggests that true ferroelectric fatigue might occur. Furthermore, the N-D response is significantly different from the 5.7 mol% concentration: For 10 s delay, there are two distinct current peaks which merge into one peak with cycling. For one second delay, the amplitude is again reduced but non-zero. It is interesting to note that especially for the virgin device the second current peak is the stable one over the delay period of one second. Accordingly, if the current peak occurring for lower voltages would be due to ferroelectric switching, from an energetic viewpoint it is unreasonable why it should relax. For the 3.5 mol% concentration, there are again distinct current peaks for both P-U and N-D response.

The test specification was identical to Fig.. 4-9.. In Fig.. 4-10 it is shown that the shorter the channel length of the 4.5 mol% concentration was, the more pronounced were the switching peaks for the P-U response.. Other than truly intrinsic device behavior, a decrease in the current response can also be caused by a smaller effective gate area when for example overlap capacitances start to dominate.. However, this would actually be the case for short channel devices, i.e.. the trend is inverted to what would be expected.. Hence, this suggests that the switching operation is rather supported by device scaling than hindered.. Furthermore, the virgin P-U response differs quite significantly for the various channel lengths: For a long channel device, two switching peaks of almost identical amplitude are visible at the beginning.. Reducing the channel length leads to a significant growth of the low voltage peak whereas the current peak occurring at higher voltages never vanishes but is rather superimposed by the low voltage peak.. For one second delay time, the higher voltage current response is not at all visible, only at the point where severe degradation sets in (after 105 endurance cycles), the peak appears at a similar position, however with much higher amplitude.. For the N-D response, a similar double hump phenomenon can be observed, however more for the short channel than for the long channel devices.. Moreover, the merging of peaks also occurs for the negative pulses but no severe shift in switching voltage is visible from 103 to 105 cycles.. As visualized by the severe delay time dependence of the PUND characteristics, effects from interface degradation and charge trapping cannot be excluded from the FeFET analysis.. Even though charge trapping and its related degradation mechanisms were not in the focus of this thesis, it became clear that these are non-negligible effects for a thorough understanding of the FeFET device.. Basic charge pumping measurements are recommended in order to provide a measure for the severeness of FeFET degradation due to parasitic charge injection..

As compared to Fig.. 4-7, it is also consistent that the antiferroelectric composition shows a much lower erased VT, whereas the reason for this circumstance is not yet fully understood (see subsection 4.2.3).. Moreover, for low programming amplitudes (1 - 2 V), the increase in trap window size, i.e.. the VT measured on the falling edge minus the VT of the preceding rising edge, is much larger for the antiferroelectric composition than for the ferroelectric compositions.. For even higher programming amplitudes, the shift in threshold voltage per amplitude and pulse width increment is quite similar to the ferroelectric compositions.. However, this is not expected if the antiferroelectric material property translates completely to the FeFET device: For an antiferroelectric FET, an increased interfacial field stress will only occur when the material switches the polarization from antiparallel to parallel.. This would correspondingly also increase the tunneling probability into the antiferroelectric film.. However, especially for fields in the range of Ec,+ FE E  Ec1,+ AFE (see subsection 2.1), trapping should be significantly more pronounced for the ferroelectric compositions.. Since this could not be observed in the measurements, the hypothesis of subsection 4.3.1 shall be revisited: Assuming that an imprinted program state leads to the low virgin VT, the trap window will develop in a similar manner as it is the case for the 4.5 mol% and 3.5 mol% compositions.. These observations obviously raise questions about the possibility to operate the array at RAM-speed..

In order to convey a better understanding on how severely the superimposed trapping contribution affects the read-out operation, the transient evolution of the threshold voltage characteristics after program was investigated.. Therefore, a specific pulse train was applied which was preceded by 102 or 104 bipolar stress cycles in order to analyze the degradation dependence of the transient VT characteristics in addition (Fig.. 4-12 (a))..

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"for detrapping pulse widths below 500 nanoseconds have to be treated with caution since the RC time constant of the measurement setup is in the same range. For the 3.5 mol% composition, a read level of -0.5 V led to the highest ION/IOFF ratio. The interrelation between detrap amplitude and pulse width was approximately exponential which is a reasonable finding for the expected detrapping process. Moreover it is interesting to see that even for a -3 V/100 s detrap pulse, the ION/IOFF ratio remains in the range of 102 - 103. Due to the fact that erase voltages are generally in the range of -5 V to -6 V, the -3 V/100 s detrap pulse actually disturbs the programmed state by half of the actual erase voltage. This could in principle lead to a (partial) loss of the programmed state which would in turn reduce the ION/IOFF ratio. A more detailed study on the effects of disturb signals will be given in subsection 5.3.2. For the 4.5 mol% composition, the ideal read out voltage shifts to 0 V whereas for these FeFETs, a clear disturb of the programmed state is visible: Detrap amplitudes which are too large in terms of their absolute magnitude start to erase the FeFET which in turn leads to a reduction in ION/IOFF ratio. 81 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SI:HFO2-BASED FEFETSConcluding on the transistor access times after program, within a real memory circuit with small RC parasitics, read access could be provided in the nanosecond regime for detrap voltages between -2 V and -3 V. This however comes at the expense of jeopardizing the stability of the written state due to the fact that the detrap voltages are approaching the disturb tolerance limit of the FeFET. Depending on the requirements set by the memory application, reduced access times in the microsecond regime might be used in order to decrease the probability of unwanted state disturb. Finally, the",458

The slow transient detrapping characteristics observed for fast retention measurements (Fig. 4-12) are again confirmed in the access time measurement: Only very negative amplitudes together with long pulse widths are able to detrap the FeFET device such that the ION/IOFF ratio approaches unity. In summary, the electrical characterization of FeFETs revealed that the superposition of charge trapping phenomena and the ferroelectric switching complicates device analysis quite significantly. This chapter shall be concluded by some important remarks that can serve as general guidelines for analysis and interpretation of FeFET device characteristics: The 1:1 transfer of MFM material properties to the FeFET cannot be taken for granted. Since Si:HfO2 is grown on a SiON interface layer, interdiffusion of silicon cannot be ruled out. This will ultimately shift the most appropriate molar concentration providing the best ferroelectric hysteresis. This is confirmed by the fact that the FeFETs with 4.5 mol% silicon incorporated have the most proper ferroelectric memory characteristics. An imprinted ferroelectric state needs to be considered based on the virgin VTand based on the absolute VT states after program and erase. In order to at least detect imprint for the Si:HfO2 system, write voltages have to be raised to levels which are close to gate stack breakdown. An alternative to this can be seen in biasing the DUTs at DC voltages while at the same time heating up the wafer. This might reveal / remove an imprint for the ferroelectric material. Depending on the silicon concentration incorporated into the host lattice, the dielectric permittivity for the ferroelectric will change quite significantly. This will change the overall voltage divider for the MFIS stack which in turn leads to e.g. different interfacial and high-k field stress for the same gate voltages applied. The coercive voltage and the remanent polarization of Si:HfO2 depend significantly on dopant species / concentration, film thickness and thermal treatment of the film. These ferroelectric parameters in turn have severe influence on interfacial field stress and the depolarization field which drive degradation as well as ferroelectric relaxation. 82 FEFET CELL ARRAY STUDY 5FeFET Cell Array Study Besides single memory cells, in order to develop volatile or non-volatile memories with reasonable bit density, array architectures have to be defined such that the periphery overhead (i.a. decoders) is kept at a minimum. Hence, memory cells need to share their terminals by means of common signal lines which are i.a. called word-, bit- or sourceline. For both volatile as well as non-volatile memories, several solutions have been found in the past which balance the need for high bit density and reliable memory operation. The first section of this chapter is devoted to the",712

The most dominant architectures are called NAND and NOR according to their Boolean relation between input (wordline) and output (bitline). Moreover, derived from the NOR architecture, the AND array represents another alternative to connect memory cells to common signal lines [208]. In the following, the architectures and their corresponding FeFET operational schemes are discussed. Fig. 5-1: AND, NOR and NAND FeFET memory array unit cells. The major difference between the first two concepts is represented in the way sourcelines are shared between neighboring cells. The NAND architecture is quite different from AND and NOR since cells are series connected. In all architectures, cells in one row share their gate contacts with each other by a common connection to the wordline WL. Furthermore, for AND / NOR, drain contacts are shared between cells in one column by means of connection to the bitline BL. For the NAND architecture this is in principle true as well, whereas access to the bitline is provided by series connection of transistors (the so called string). 83 FEFET CELL ARRAY STUDYAND and NOR architectures have classically been used for Flash memories which require random read capability [167], i.e. fast read access to individual bits has to be provided. Due to the fact that severeal application specific implementations of NOR and AND architectures have been developed during the last decades, these architectures are distinct in various ways. For instance, one of the differences between AND and NOR can be represented by the way the connection to the bitline is achieved: For the NOR architecture, two cells are always contacted directly to the first metal layer whereas for the AND architecture a diffused bitline is used. This enables a slightly smaller cell size for the AND architecture as compared to the NOR architecture (8F2 as compared to 10F2, whereas F represents the smallest feature size of a technology node [29]). This in turn",508
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"in a slower operation of the AND architecture due to the higher resistance of the diffused bitline.. In case the source areas are not common to all cells in a memory block, there is also a difference in the way the sourceline SL is shared: For the AND architecture, cells in one column share their source contacts whereas for the NOR architecture this is the case for cells in one row.. This has no immediate relevance for Flash-based cells (Flash memory blocks in general have a common sourceline) but provides an additional degree of freedom with respect to disturb inhibition of FeFET cells as will be shown later on.. Moreover, the NAND architecture is quite different from both AND and NOR due to the fact that the memory cells are serially connected in a string.. Access to the strings of memory cells is provided by the so called select gates (Select-Gate-Drain SGD and Select-Gate-Source SGS).. The source is common to all cells in one memory block.. The major advantage of this architecture lies in the sharing of source and drain regions between transistors which minimizes the cell size to 4F2.. The advantage of high bit density comes at the price of a reduced drain current due to the series connection of several transistors.. This is one of the reasons why the NAND architecture is more useful for data than for code storage.. The fourth terminal of the FeFET, i.e.. the bulk contact, is omitted in the cell array analysis due to the fact that the well / bulk is considered to be common to all FeFETs.. A non-common bulk contact has been discussed in the past [199] and seems only possible with specific integration schemes [192].. Even though this was not considered in this study, it represents a promising approach especially with respect to disturb inhibition.. Since the program and erase physics behind Flash devices are fundamentally different from FeFET devices, operational schemes of the array architectures will vary as well.. First, the AND array is analyzed by comparing exemplified operational schemes for AND Flash devices [20] to proposed operational schemes for FeFET arrays (Tab.. 5-1).. Tab.. 5-1: Operational schemes for AND architecture..",449

For single bit erase by PSDES it is again assumed that a 5 V drain side disturb does not alter the programmed state of cells sharing the selected column. Both for 3T and 2T NOR architectures, an alternative erase scheme is of course represented by block wise bulk erase or WLW negative gate erase. Even though bit alterability is then lost, the most energy efficient operating scheme arises for the 3T NOR architecture: In an ideal case, only the selected wordline has to be raised to 5 V for a few nanoseconds while the WEL consumes only power from charging to 0.5 V. Moreover, adding extra transistors to the NAND architecture aims at avoiding the pass voltage disturb which is occurring for both program as well as read operations. By connecting logic transistors in parallel to the FeFET memory cells, disturbance can be reduced significantly.

This has to be done for all pass transistors having an index smaller than (m-1). At RL (m-1) the cut voltage is applied according to the LSBPI scheme. Hence, the pass disturb, which is most severe for cells in the selected string, is eliminated. Similarly, this is also the case for the read operation where pass voltages are only applied to read lines (except for index m) and all wordlines are kept at ground. However, program disturb for cells sharing the selected wordline remains the same. 5.3Validation and Verification of Proposed Array Concepts In order to verify the assumptions which were made for defining the array operating conditions, both TCAD simulation as well as electrical characterization can be applied. Finite Element Analysis (FEA), as it is used for TCAD simulation, is i.a. able to accurately calculate the electric field distribution also for more complex transistor geometries as they are used on a 28 nm technology node. By applying the operational schemes which were suggested in the previous sections to a so called mixed-mode simulation model, it is possible to check on the parasitic state loss in a more detailed fashion as it is possible for electrical characterization. However, the simulation model itself has to be validated by",1120

Beyond that, these simulations can be extended to connect multiple 2D or even 3D transistor geometries including the addition of HSPICE compact models.. Thus, mixed-mode TCAD simulations are situated in between pure TCAD simulations and compact model simulations like HSPICE.. By using this approach it is possible to create memory array unit cells as described in section 5.1 which then serve as the basis for verifying the operational schemes by simulation.. In the following, the simulations are limited to the most promising array concepts, i.e.. AND and NAND.. At the beginning, the AND array was analyzed with respect to its program / erase characteristics and its related disturbs.. Depending on which write operation shall be performed on a FeFET, different worst case disturb scenarios can be identified in terms of the memory array unit cell (Fig.. 5-4)..

During the program operation of cell (1,2) for example, the inhibit signals that are applied cause a negative voltage drop across cell (2,1) (to be precise, this is the disturb for gate to source / drain).. Hence, if the cell has previously been written in a low-VT state (""1"") the negative voltage drop will tend to erase the cell.. This therefore represents the worst case..

After setting the worst case states for program disturb, the reference threshold voltages were extracted first using a wordline sweep from -1.5 V to 1.5 V while biasing the bitlines at 100 mV. Even though the 5 V write amplitude is not sufficient to bring the FeFET into polarization saturation, it suffices to induce a memory window of approximately 1.25 V. Afterwards, the program operation for cell (1,2) was carried out whereas program an inhibit pulses were applied to the signal lines according to Fig. 5-4. Subsequently, another read operation identical to the one used for reference VT extraction was carried out. In Fig. 5-5 (a), the",168
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"from these program disturb analysis are shown. First of all it can be observed that when no inhibit pulses are applied, the threshold voltages after program disturb do not reach the respective reference VT. This is caused by the read disturb that occurs when sweeping the wordlines from -1.5 V to 1.5 V. Moreover, the cells sharing the selected wordline, in this case cell (1,1), completely loses its initial erased state because it is programmed in the same manner due to inh = 0. Only for an inhibit factor of 0.7 it is possible to more or less maintain the high-VT state of cell (1,1). For inhibit factors higher than 0.7, the program disturb on both cell (1,1) and cell (2,2) approaches VP/2 which gradually deteriorates the erased state. Even though for inh = 1 and cell (2,1) the disturb voltage across the gate to source / drain region is also VP/2, it does not affect the VT state that severely. This originates from the fact that, different from cell (1,1) and (2,2), the scenario of cell (2,1) represents a disturb of the low-VT state. It is triggered by large positive source / drain potentials which are not as effective 94 FEFET CELL ARRAY STUDY in changing the gate stack polarization as e.g. negative gate voltages. This will be explained in the succeeding paragraphs where the erase disturb via PSDES will be analyzed in more detail. The various origins of polarization loss are again illustrated by the P-EFE characteristics of cell (1,1) in Fig. 5-5 (b). The most severe polarization loss is actually caused by the internal depolarization field which is inherent to the material composition and the FeFET device. Moreover, the read disturb also reduces the polarization by approximately 1.5 C/cm2. The final program disturb reduces the polarization to around 0.5 C/cm2 which is still sufficient to maintain the memory window, i.e. in the case of program disturb the surface charge density is still sufficient to stay in accumulation. For a bit-wise erase of the AND array, the PSDES was proposed in section 5.1. Therefore, an erase operation as illustrated in Fig. 5-4 was simulated and the disturbs of cells adjacent to cell (1,2) were extracted (Fig. 5-5 (c)). By using 5 V for the PSDES, the high-VT state of cell (1,2) was approximately 300 mV lower than for cell (2,1). This originates from the fact that the initial erased state of cell (2,1) was set by a negative gate erase which is more effective than the PSDES. However, for an inhibit factor of 0.6, a reasonable sense margin of 600 mV can still be maintained (MW between cell (1,2) and (2,2)). The shift of the inhibit factor of about 0.1 between program and erase disturb is also caused by the different effectiveness of positive gate program and positive source / drain erase operation. In order to illustrate the influence of ferroelectric material parameters on the disturb characteristics, the simulation was also carried out for FeFETs with a 30 nm Si:HfO2 ferroelectric. The ferroelectric properties were again adjusted to those observed in",736

Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,Results,"from erase disturb on cell (1,1) and intentional erase on cell (1,2) are shown. For a 10 nm film, the erase of cell (1,2) was analyzed first with respect to different wordline and source- / bitline voltages. The previously described higher erase efficiency of a NGE is again reflected in the contour lines of the cell (1,2) erase characteristics (Fig. 5-10 (a)). For example, applying -3 V to WL(m) while keeping SL/BL(n+1) at ground causes a shift to higher VT values than when +3 V are applied to SL/BL(n+1) while keeping WL(m) at ground. This is a simple result from the different electric field distribution of NGE and PSDES. These two cases also describe the disturb scenarios which occur for cell (1,1) and cell (2,2) respectively, i.e. cell (1,1) experiences a negative gate voltage disturb while cell (2,2) experiences a positive source / drain voltage disturb. The disturb scenarios effectively represent the first row and the first column of Fig. 5-10 (a) and are additionally extended to 10 V amplitudes in Fig. 5-10 (c). In total, a disturb free operation for cell (1,1) and cell (2,2) was considered until approximately 25 % memory window loss. This resulted in an operational point of -1.5 V (WL) / +1.5 V (SL/BL). However, the erase of cell (1,2) was rather incomplete for these operating conditions which makes the VDD/2 PSDES not a viable option for devices possessing ferroelectric films of 10 nm thickness. On the other hand, for the 30 nm Si:HfO2 case, the VDD/2 scheme was more appropriate. For the same 25 % memory window loss specification for disturbed cells, the erase operation of cell (1,2) increases the relative memory window by more than 25 % (the relative memory window is the absolute MW normalized to the maximum achievable MW). This can be seen in Fig. 5-10 (b) by the shift of the operational point (diamond) into the bluish high-VT area. Hence, due to a remaining memory window of  2 V between erased cell (1,2) and disturbed cells (1,1) and (2,2), the VDD/2 PSDES appears to be a viable option for FeFETs possessing a 30 nm Si:HfO2 film. 98 FEFET CELL ARRAY STUDY The potential functionality of the VDD/2 PSDES is again based on both the higher erase efficiency of the PSDES for thicker ferroelectric films and the more suitable ferroelectric parameters that were extracted from",612
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,experiment,". Another illustration of this is given by the polarization profile within the HfO2 at erase bias (Fig. 5-10 (e)). For the 10 nm film it can be seen that a large volume fraction of the ferroelectric stays in a positive polarization state which prohibits a proper shift to the high-VT erased state. For the 30 nm film, besides an overall reduced polarization due to different ferroelectric parameters, the polarization in the stack is more uniform. Moreover, a clear differentiation between a predominantly positive polarization state for cell (1,1) and a predominantly negative polarization state for cell (1,2) can be observed. Besides the AND architecture, the NAND array can also be considered a viable candidate for FeFET memory arrays. Three different operational schemes were proposed in section 5.1 which are derived from traditional NAND Flash memories. In the following paragraphs, the functionality of the Traditional Program Inhibit (TPI) and Global/Local-Self-Boost-Program-Inhibit (G/LSBPI) scheme are verified based on TCAD simulations. As mentioned before, by mixed-mode simulations it was possible to couple several TCAD geometries with lumped circuit elements. Hence, a fundamental NAND unit cell was created via series connection of three FeFET devices (Fig. 5-11). VP disturb Vpass disturbBL (1)BL (2)bWL1BLCell 1cBLVoltageWL (1)0 00 0WL2WL1WL (2)WL3Cell 2WL2WL (3)0 0Cell 3WL3TimeFig. 5-11: NAND worst case program and pass disturb and modeling thereof.

(c) Simulated pulse sequences in case of VWL1 = 0.7 VWL2 and VBL = 0.3 Vwrite wheras VWL2 = 7 V. As an example, in case of a TPI scheme, an actual inhibit voltage is applied to the bitlines of non-selected strings which then has to transfer to the cells sharing the programmed wordline. On the other hand, for the G/LSBPI schemes, the unselected strings are disconnected from the bitline such that program inhibit takes place via global or local self-boost. In order to model the efficiency of these different operational schemes, a mixed-mode TCAD model was created by simple series connection of three FeFET transistors (Fig. 5-11 (b)). The gates were connected to lumped voltage sources and the drain of the first cell was connected to another lumped voltage source which provided the bitline signal. Depending on the magnitude of the voltage pulses applied to the gates and drain of the string, the mentioned operational schemes could be modeled. The actual pulse trains that were used for simulation first set all of the string cells into an erased state via NGE, followed by a read of the string current, the actual program operation and finally another read operation (Fig. 5-11 (c)). Similar to the simulations of the AND architecture, tri-level 99 FEFET CELL ARRAY STUDYpulses with appropriate delay times were chosen in order to reduce the magnitudes of the parasitic disturb signals. By parameterizing the simulations in terms of Vpass and VBL, the effectiveness of the proposed operational schemes could be analyzed. Based on these",847

(b), (d) Corresponding on- to off-current ratio of the string extracted from the read operation after program and erase respectively. The FeFETs that were used for NAND string simulation were again parameterized according to a 30 nm Si:HfO2 ferroelectric thin film. Accordingly, the program and erase voltages were chosen to be 7 V which ensured a saturated operation of the device. The three transistors of the string were first initialized into an erased state by applying a negative gate voltage. Even though Cell 2 of the string had both source and drain regions floating, the erased state was almost identical to Cell 1 and 3 which justified the negative gate erase. Afterwards, the string current was read by applying 2.5 V to Cell 1 and 3 whereas Cell 2 was kept at 0.5 V. The higher amplitude for Cell 1 and 3 ensured that also fully erased cells were driven above their threshold voltage. The cell under specific consideration, i.e. Cell 2, was set to the lower read voltage of 0.5 V to either drive a significant current if programmed into a low-VT state or to inhibit the current flow if it had previously been erased. Consequently, after erasing all three cells at the beginning, the reference off-current of the string was recorded by the read operation. For the sake of completeness it shall again be highlighted that the read operation itself creates a certain amount of disturb. However, compared to the succeeding program disturb, the read disturb was found to be negligible. After the read operation of the erased state, the actual program operation was carried out utilizing tri-level pulses aiming to minimize state disturb. First, the bitline signal was ramped to half of its final value. When this level was reached, WL 1 was also ramped to half of its final value. Afterwards, the bitline voltage was further increased to its final value followed by the ramp of WL 1, also to its final value. At the point at which both bitline 100 FEFET CELL ARRAY STUDY and WL 1 had reached their desired amplitudes, the actual program pulse of 7 V was applied to WL 2. This transient sequence was used in order to apply the bitline inhibit voltage always before WL 1 was ramped to the next level in order to minimize Vpass disturb. The final values of both WL 1 and bitline voltage were parameterized and were always multiples of 10 % Vwrite (0.7 V). For both short and long channel devices, Fig. 5-12 shows the",605
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"of these simulations for Cell 1 and Cell 2 in terms of the change in polarization due to the program operation. Furthermore it summarizes the effect of the change in polarization with respect to the resulting ION to IOFF ratio of the string current. First of all, the state disturb due to the 2.5 V read signal could be extracted for Cell 1 under zero Vpass and VBL bias. It can be seen that up to 40 % of the maximum switched polarization of 2PS are already altered by the read operation (Fig. 5-12 (a) and (c)). Even though this read disturb is quite significant, it does not prohibit the operation in NAND architecture as will be shown in the next paragraphs. For short channel devices and large bitline / relatively low pass voltages, the difference between polarization after erase PE and after program PP becomes less than 20 % of 2PS. This can be attributed to a restoring of the erased state after read due to a partial positive bitline erase (similar to the PSDES for an AND architecture). For long channel devices, this trend cannot be observed due to the ineffectiveness of the erase for a positive bitline voltage. Furthermore, for zero bitline bias, the erased state of Cell 1 is gradually disturbed starting from Vpass = 50 % Vwrite, i.e. at around 3.5 V. By increasing the bitline voltage, obviously also the onset of Vpass disturb is shifted to higher voltages. Hence, the Vpass disturb scenarios of both long and short channel devices can be considered quite identical. For Cell 2, a zero Vpass and VBL bias corresponds to the cell being cut off from Cell 1 and 3. For short channel devices, the program operation provokes an additional state loss of approximately 70 % which adds to the  20 % state loss due to read disturb. This",383

Hence, due to the non-ideal off-state behavior of short channel devices, the cut-off does not properly work for the given device geometry. Accordingly, program inhibition by local self-boost does not seem viable. On the other hand, long channel devices lose only additional 25 % of 2PS which indicates that a self-boost operation might work in this case. The overall operating conditions for both short channel and long channel devices were finally extracted from the on- to off-current characteristics of the string (Fig. 5-12 (b) and (d)). Under the premise of proper program, program inhibition and avoidance of Vpass disturb, the operating conditions for strings of short channel cells are as follows: High pass voltages of 80 % and bitline voltages of 40 % (selected string) and 90 % (non-selected string) of Vwrite have to be chosen in order to enable a NAND architecture and operation. This",210

However, for the given Vwrite of 7 V, the required bitline voltages by far exceed the standard supply or I/O voltages. This will in turn result in a larger effective cell size due to the increased area consumption of HV periphery transistors and memory cells. On the contrary, for long channel devices, the ION/IOFF ratio validates that no high Vpass voltages are required to enable the NAND architecture and operation. A pass voltage of 3.5 V enables both the programming of the selected cell whereas programming can also be inhibited by applying 2.8 V to the bitline of non-selected strings. The resulting string current ratio is around seven orders of magnitude which provides a much higher sensing margin as compared to short channel devices. Moreover, the maximum bitline voltage is in the range of standard I/O specifications which means that bitline periphery does not require space consuming HV devices. 101 FEFET CELL ARRAY STUDY5.3.2State Disturb and Write Inhibition of Single FeFET Cells Besides validating the proposed operational schemes by TCAD simulations, electrical characterization of multi-transistor macros was used in order to emulate the disturb scenarios ocurring in FeFET memory arrays. That is, the multi-structure is first written into a programmed or erased state by applying the corresponding electrical field. Afterwards, a field of opposite polarity and reduced amplitude is applied in order to emulate disturb conditions that would occur in a memory array. As described in the previous sections, there are various ways of operating the same memory array which accordingly translates into various disturb scenarios. The mentioned tri-level waveforms were used to study the disturb characteristics of multi-transistor structures (Lg = 30 nm; W = 1 m; 100 devices in parallel) in a VDD/3 PSDES AND scheme. In total, there were six disturb tests performed, i.e. the worst case scenarios for cell (1,1), cell (2,1) and cell (2,2) which occur for writing a ""1"" or a ""0"" to cell (1,2) (compare Fig. 5-4). The multi-structure was first either programmed with a 4 V/10 s pulse on the gate or erased by a 5 V/1 s pulse on source and drain regions in order to write the initial state for the respective disturb test. Then, waveforms according to Fig. 5-4 were applied numerous times in order to disturb the FeFET cell accordingly. Once per cycling decade, Id-Vg characteristics were acquired to check on the potential VT degradation. As an example, for the worst case scenario of cell (1,1), the multi-structure was erased (brought into the ""0""state) by applying 5 V/1 s pulse to its source and drain regions. Afterwards, the tri-level gate pulse as well as the two level drain / source pulse was applied. The base level of both pulses was 0 V, the intermediate level of the tri-level pulse was VDD/3, i.e. 4 V/3 ≈ 1.3 V, the amplitude of the source/drain pulse was 24 V/3 ≈ 2.7V and the third level of the tri-level pulse was obviously 4 V. The pulse widths and delay times were chosen in the 10 s range such that the source/drain pulse started to rise only when the first level of the tri-level pulse had already reached 1.3 V. Furthermore, the second slope of the tri-level pulse started to rise only after the source/drain pulse had already reached 2.7 V. This ensured that at no point in time VGS or VGD were larger than 1.3 V. Moreover, due to the fact that the erased VT was not higher than VDD/3, the inhibit voltage was expected to transfer properly underneath the gate stack.

Since for the multi-transistor structures that specific concentration led to the best FeFET properties, it was also included for the MPW processing.

It is not yet fully understood which processing conditions are influencing Si:HfO2 fatigue characteristics the most, however, as mentioned in subsection 2.3.1, the thermal budget indeed plays an important role. 105 FEFET MEMORY ARRAYS6.2Program / Erase Characteristics of FeFET Cell Arrays FeFET memory arrays were first tested according to the procedure given in subsection 4.2.1, i.e. all cells in an array were tested as a parallel connection. This ensured an as close as possible comparison to the FeFET multi-structures that were analyzed before. Quasi-DC Id-Vg measurements were performed in order to verify which of the three chosen silicon dopant concentrations (3.7 mol%, 4.3 mol% or 5.2 mol%) induced a proper ferroelectric memory window. Therefore, the 11 wordlines of a 121 bit NOR array (34 nm x 80 nm cell dimension) were connected in parallel and hysteretically swept from -5V to 5V. The 11 bitlines of the array were connected in parallel as well and a constant bias voltage of 100 mV was applied (Fig. 6-3).

On the parallel connected array it was possible to verify that the 3.7 mol% as well as the 4.3 mol% composition showed a proper ferroelectric / counterclockwise Id-Vg hysteresis. When plotted on a linear scale and compared to the ferroelectric concentrations of the previous test chip (Fig. 4-3), the shift of the current characteristics was even more ideal / more parallel. Hence, the ferroelectric characteristics of the MFM capacitors again transferred well to the integrated device lot. Furthermore, the 5.2 mol% composition could only produce a trap window, i.e. a clockwise Id-Vg hysteresis. Consequently, the next step was to reproduce the",705

Therefore, an array of the 4.3 mol% composition was first programmed / erased at  5 V / 1 us or at  7 V / 1 us. This was again achieved by connecting all wordlines together while keeping the other terminals on ground. However, the read procedure after program / erase was then carried out cell-wise. That is, the wordline of the selected cell was swept from -1 V to 2 V while the corresponding bitline was biased at 100 mV. Unselected wordlines were set to a -1.5 V read inhibit voltage, i.e. cells that potentially reside in a low-VT state are brought into a non-conducting accumulation or depletion state. This ensures that the bitline current that is sensed is dominated by the selected cell and not by the unselected cells sharing the same bitline. Surprisingly, the resulting VT distributions did not reflect proper memory characteristics as they were first anticipated from the quasi-DC measurements (Fig. 6-4). 106 FEFET MEMORY ARRAYS WL1BL1BL2BL3BL4BL5BL6BL7BL8BL9BL10BL11bVT [V]-1 - -0.75c-0.75 - -0.5-0.5 - -0.25-0.25 - 00 - 0.250.25 – 0.50.5 - 0.750.75 - 1adWL2WL3 WL4 WL5 WL6 WL7 WL8 WL9 WL10WL115V / 1uss1ussFEFET MEMORY ARRAYSwhich was difficult to establish for some cells.

Based on simple capacitor structures it was possible to show that the novel ferroelectric possesses proper non-volatile memory characteristics. Thermal stability of the switching effect, retention and endurance characteristics all could fulfill or even surpass the requirements of state-of-the-art NVM materials. Moreover, investigations regarding the switching kinetics of the ferroelectric led to the assignment of a nucleation-limited-switching mechanism in 10 nm Si:HfO2 thin films. These",127
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"validate that polarization switching in Si:HfO2 might indeed happen at the speed of sound. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the ferroelectric material properties of Si:HfO2 can be tailored significantly. The molar concentration of silicon incorporated into the HfO2 host lattice, post metallization annealing conditions as well as thickness scaling allow for the adjustment and optimization of the ferroelectric according to application specific requirements. Due to the proven CMOS compatibility of HfO2, the world's first 28 nm ferroelectric field effect transistors could be realized as the central application of this thesis. Various characterization methodologies were applied in order to determine how good the previously determined NVM material characteristics can be translated to the FeFET. The switching speed was again validated to be solely limited by the measurement setup, i.e. write operations in the microsecond-regime could be achieved without restrictions. For the first time it was also possible to demonstrate that retention characteristics could be extrapolated to ten years even after a significant amount of polarization reversals had been performed. The total amount of endurance cycles was however significantly reduced as compared to the characteristics obtained for ferroelectric capacitors. Based on fast transient electrical characterization, electron trapping in the gate stack of the FeFET was proposed as the most likely cause. This hypothesis was supported by TCAD simulations which revealed an interfacial field stress of more than 20 MV/cm, i.e. close to hard dielectric breakdown. Besides accelerated endurance degradation, the parasitic charge trapping that superimposes the ferroelectric memory characteristics was also found to deteriorate the read access speed after program. A countermeasure to mitigate these negative effects was presented in terms of a detrapping pulse scheme. This enables the read access time to remain in the microsecond regime while maintaining proper memory operation without disturb. Moreover, a viable option for improving the endurance characteristics in the future is represented by material engineering of the ferroelectric itself. For slightly thicker Si:HfO2 films, a significantly reduced remanent polarization was observed in",436

Derived from these simulations, a general procedure for device optimization was proposed which allows for taking the feasibility of engineering certain material parameters into account. By separating the figure of merit of a FeFET design in terms of figures of performance and feasibility, a realistic device optimization is envisioned. Furthermore, the procedure can be utilized for optimization of different target applications (e.g. volatile vs. non-volatile memories) by adjusting the various weights of the figures of performance. In order to lift the Si:HfO2 FeFET concept from single device to array level, a cell array study was carried out which served as the basis for a novel test chip. The applicability of 109",152

A VDD/3 operation was identified as a viable scheme for a FeFET array in AND configuration whereas a novel so called Positive-Source-Drain-Erase-Scheme (PSDES) was proposed. The scheme possesses bit selectivity for both program and erase operation and therefore enables a true random access operation of the array. Based on the cell array study, a test chip was designed and manufactured that allowed the array operation of 28 nm FeFET cells for the first time. Final measurements indicated that the threshold voltage distribution of individual FeFET cells is rather wide and a uniform operation of the arrays could not be demonstrated at the beginning. However, by utilizing an Incremental-Step-Pulse-Programming scheme it was possible to separate the programmed and erased VT-distribution of a 90 bit NAND array by approximately 300 mV. In summary, the",187
Dissertation Stefan Ferdinand Müller_Development of HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Memories for Future.docx,results,"presented in this thesis confirm that the recently discovered ferroelectric properties of HfO2 are indeed in favor of ferroelectric memory applications. The extraordinary NVM characteristics of the material itself can be translated to aggressively scaled FeFET devices which can be used to build high density memory arrays. Future work will have to focus on the statistical evaluation of large size memory arrays in order to validate final product applicability of Si:HfO2 FeFET memories. Moreover, Si:HfO2 also holds great promise to be applicable to alternative memory concepts like e.g. traditional 1T-1C FRAM memories. Due to the NVM properties and the proven CMOS compatibility of Si:HfO2, the presented research findings shall motivate increased efforts aiming at the commercialization of memory applications based on ferroelectric hafnium oxide. 110",182

Miko_FEFET_Endurance_IMW_2020.docx,Abstract,"— In this paper, recent advances on the development of Hafnium oxide (HfO2)-based ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) are shown with respect to its memory window, trapping behavior and endurance characteristics. Although this novel ferroelectric memory cell shows superior characteristics such as device scalability, CMOS compatibility, fast access time and low power operation, the challenges for HfO2-based FeFET device lie with device variability and endurance. To investigate endurance failure in relation to charge trapping, different time delays were introduced to allow for detrapping of charges leading to improved endurance behavior. Besides the continuous improvements in process technology which minimize trap densities, we here demonstrate a mitigation of device variability, using a targeted programming scheme, with which a significantly lower device variability is achieved.",213
Miko_FEFET_Endurance_IMW_2020.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Since the first discovery of the ferroelectric properties of HfO2 thin films in 2007 originating from the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic Pca21 crystal phase [1], [2] a significant interest has evolved for devices based on ferroelectric HfO2 (FE-HfO2) due to their numerous attractive features, including CMOS-compatibility, fast write time and low power operation. However, at the current stage, the HfO2-based FeFET devices are still not reaching their expected capability regarding endurance degradation and device variability. It is well known in the community that the degradation of the gate stack induced by charge trapping and trap generation is the main driving force for its endurance failure [3], [4]. Meanwhile the polycrystallinity of the deposited ferroelectric film can induce variability of film properties, which eventually leads to variation of device behavior as well [5], [6]. In order to analyze the deterioration of the gate stack caused by endurance cycling, a set of endurance tests with different time delays were implemented. In addition, to decrease the variability of the device performance across wafer, a targeted programming scheme is applied aiming at more uniform device performance at the wafer level. II.",263

That means the final physical dimensions are 450 x 450 nm2, 180 x 180 nm2 and 72 x 72 nm2 correspondingly. B.Measurement Setup The test facility is equipped with a 300 mm fully automated wafer prober (Precio™ XL from Tokyo Electron) and a PXI-system from National Instruments for electrical measurement. Within this measurement setup currents are measured from the source side of the FeFET and together with the applied gate voltage pulses the drain current gate voltage (IdVg)-curve can be obtained for each device, out of which the threshold voltage Vthwas then extracted using a constant drain current criterion, in this case it is 1 µA * WG (gate width) / LG (gate length). The whole wafer is split into two groups of 64 dies, one is cycled with 10 bipolar wake-up cycles and the other with 1000 bipolar wake-up cycles. Each group is then further split into two subgroups with each subgroup programmed into either low Vth (LVT) state or erased into the high Vth(HVT) state at the end of the test. III.",309
Miko_FEFET_Endurance_IMW_2020.docx,DISCUSSION,"The LVT and HVT extractions in this paper are executed after a 40 ms and 1 ms time delay after the program/erase pulse correspondingly. The criterion for choosing this specific time delay for the LVT and HVT extraction is, on the one hand, based on the short term retention test as shown in Fig. 5 which reveals electron and hole trapping behavior while on the other hand keeping the total test time at a reasonable range. As it can be clearly seen in Fig. 5, the device shows a strong electron trapping and hardly any hole trapping. The LVT states become stable after about 40 ms while the HVT states are already stable after 40 µs due to negligible hole trapping. Thus, a time delay of 40 ms and 1 ms after program and erase pulse are considered appropriate to read the Vthby sweeping the gate voltage from 0 V to 2.5 V without being affected significantly by residual charge trapping. In the following, recent advances and",204
Miko_FEFET_Endurance_IMW_2020.docx,results,"on the HfO2-based FeFET development are reviewed, the memory window (MW) across wafer, trapping behavior and endurance characteristics are shown. Then, the endurance behavior with different delay times between program and erase pulse is compared and discussed. In the end, the effectiveness of a targeted programming scheme is verified. after a write pulse (either program or erase) and after sufficient delay time, an additional pulse of same polarity compared to the write pulse but with variable amplitude is applied to the device. After this variable pulse, an immediate read-out is then performed. Since the ferroelectric switching has already occurred during the write pulse, the trapping behavior can then be measured independently. Fig. 7 shows that there is barely any hole trapping but a large amount of electron trapping independent of device geometries. This is attributed to the defect densities of the HfO2 material and the interface. The band diagram of the gate stack at both program and erase conditions (Fig. 3) shows that during program, electrons could potentially be injected into the gate stack and during erase process the electrons will tunnel back and some hole trapping can occur. A.Recent advances on FeFETs fter P reversa fter P reversa The memory window wafer map of various device geometries after 10 bipolar wake-up cycles is shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that with decreasing device size, the memory window decreases whereas the variability of LVT and HVT states increases. The reason for this could be that the deposited ferroelectric HfO2 film is only partially crystallized into the desired orthorhombic Pca21 phase due to the intrinsic polycrystalline characteristics of the film. Accordingly, statistical fluctuations in film composition might impact smaller devices more than larger devices. To get a deeper understanding of the influence from device sizes on its variability, a simulation of the FeFET with size 500 x 500 nm2 and 80 x 80 nm2 based on a grain model (described in detail in upcoming publications) is undertaken und the result is shown in Fig. 2 below. a) 500 x 500 nm2 500 x 500 nm2b) 80 x 80 nm2Fig. 2. IdVg curves of simulated FeFETs based on 30 nm grain size. Dipole angle for each grain is fully randomly chosen between 0° and 90°, 0° means horizontal, i.e. no effect on Vth shift and 90° means vertical, i.e. maximum effect on Vth shift. In total 200 runs are executed and the read is swept from 0 V to 2.5 V. As it can be seen from Fig. 2, the device size 500 x 500 nm2 has more grains and shows a smaller device variability compared to 80 x 80 nm2, which agrees well with the measurement data. The estimated bit error rate (BER) is 1.89e-19, 2.29e-5 and 1.12e-1 for device sizes of 500 x 500 nm2, 200 x 200 nm2 and 80 x 80 nm2 respectively as shown in Fig. 6. The calculation of BER assumes that the Vth distribution is normal and is calculated such that it represents the point at which extrapolated LVT normal distribution and extrapolated HVT normal distribution start to overlap. A closer look at the MW wafermap reveals that the cells with smaller MW can be found mainly around the wafer edge independent of the device geometries. In order to study the influences of charge trapping on the endurance behavior of FeFET devices, we first must identify the trapping behavior of the film, thus, a set of trapping tests are implemented. The trapping test is implemented such that order traps -e- trapping - e- bac tunne ing- order traps -generation-generation---Ti -Ti htrappingFE-HfO2P-t pe ub FE-HfO2P-t pe ub nterfacia nterfacia a er a erFig.3. Band diagram of the FeFET gate stack at both program (+4 V for 10 µs) and erase (-4 V for 10 µs) condition. Hole trapping shifts the HVT to lower voltages whereas electron trapping shifts the LVT to higher voltages. Since this represents the opposite direction compared to the effect of polarization switching on Vth, charge injection leads to a MW decrease. As can be seen from Fig. 7, already starting from 1V, the electron trapping increases very rapidly and reaches its saturation at around pulse amplitudes of 3.5 V. The endurance characteristics of the FeFET for 3 different device geometries is shown in Fig. 8. After 10 bipolar wake-up cycles the memory cell is stressed by an alternating program (+4 V for 10 µs) and erase (-4 V for 10 µs) pulse with a delay time of 10 µs after the program pulse. In between a specific number of bipolar cycles (in this case, 1, 10, 100, 1k and 10k) the cell is set into a programmed state, read out and then set into an erased state and read out to get the respective Vth. The boxplot from Fig. 8 shows the trend of both LVT and HVT movement as the device is cycled. Both move upwards due to the strong electron trapping behavior which cannot be compensated by hole trapping (see Fig. 7). During the cycling process the electrons which are trapped as a response to the positive program pulse can be released out of the gate stack or compensated by holes injected into the gate stack due to the subsequent negative erase pulse. The continuous injection and release of charges into the gate stack can lead to additional trap generation both within the HfO2 and at the interface between the interface oxide and the HfO2. [3] B.Passive detrapping for better endurance performance In order to get a better understanding of the correlation between charge trapping and endurance performance two sets of endurance tests were performed. Different delay times after the program and erase pulse were introduced and tests were performed separately. The tests were executed only on the 500 x 500 nm2 device geometry because this larger device geometry shows stronger Vth shifts during endurance cycling.",1412

Miko_FEFET_Endurance_IMW_2020.docx,results,"are shown in Fig. 10b. The device geometry chosen is 200 x 200 nm2. As it is shown in Fig. 10b, a substantial improvement in standard deviation of LVT can be achieved by applying the targeted programming scheme to the device, thus the extrapolated BER can be improved by approximately 70 ms b) d) two orders of magnitude. A more elaborate targeted programming involving time variation can be utilized in the future which should lead to even lower BER. a) b) Fig. 9. Endurance test with two different time delays: 4 ms and 70 ms after program pulse (a, b) and after erase pulse (c, d). The test sequence is shown above in the first row, the program/erase pulse for the endurance test is +/-4 V 10 µs and the time delay is added after program (left) and after erase (right) respectively. comparing Fig. 9 to Fig. 8, longer delay time after program causes less upward shifting of the LVT and HVT states (Fig. 9a and 9b). A longer delay time after erase pulse mainly causes less upward shifting of the HVT state (see Fig. 9c and 9d). Especially the improvement in LVT shift with longer delay times after a program operation is attributed to the detrapping process. An active detrapping process by way of an immediate erase pulse after programming deteriorates the gate stack by hot holes injected from the silicon substrate. Hence less traps are generated in the gate stack if the detrapping process is not accelerated. This also explains why a longer delay time after an erase pulse is not preventing the LVT state from moving to higher voltages, since in this scenario an active detrapping process of trapped electrons can be assumed. However, for both extended delay times after program and after erase pulse, the HVT state showes less upward movement of about 200 mV during cycling. Referring back to the previous trapping test",532

narayan_domain_matching_epitaxy_JAP_2003.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Epitaxial growth of thin films and the control of defects in thin film heterostructures are key considerations for the next-generation of microelectronic, optical and magnetic devices.1–3As device feature sizes get smaller, single dislo-cations will have the ability to control device performance.. In the well-established lattice-matching epitaxy, where the lattice misfit is small �less than 7%–8%�, films grow pseudo-morphically up to a ‘‘critical thickness’’ where it becomes energetically favorable for the film to contain dislocations.4,5 In this case, the dislocations are generated at the film surface and glide to the interface; therefore, the Burgers vectors and planes of the dislocations are dictated by the slip vectors and glide planes of the crystal structure of the film.6On the other hand, for dislocations generated at the edge of islands during three-dimensional growth, geometrical constraints determine the Burgers vectors of the dislocations at the film–substrate interface.. For example, during three-dimensional growth of germanium on silicon, it has been found that 90° dislocations with a/2�110� Burgers vectors are created at the edge of germanium islands and lie in the �001� film–substrate interface.7 Conventional wisdom maintains that lattice matching epitaxy during thin film growth is possible as long a�Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail: j_narayan@ncsu.edu as the lattice misfit between the film and the substrate is less than 7%–8%.. Smaller lattice misfit leads to smaller interfa-cial energy and coherent epitaxy is formed.. Above this mis-fit, it was surmised that the film will grow textured or largely polycrystalline.4,5 In an earlier publication8and patent9we showed that films having a large misfit relative to the substrate (�7%�8%) grow epitaxially in the form of single crystals by domain matching epitaxy �DME�, where integral multiples of lattice constants match across film–substrate interfaces.8,9 Kwo et al.10reported epitaxial structures of Y and Gd films on Nb substrates via alignment of most densely packed rows between the film and the substrate (�1¯21¯0���002�)..",534

In the domain match-ing epitaxy, the matching of lattice planes of the film d f with those of the substrate ds is considered with similar crystal symmetry. In DME, the film and the substrate planes could be quite different as long as they maintain the crystal sym-metry. The LME, on the other hand, involves the matching of the same planes between the film and the substrate. In DME, the initial misfit strain (��d f /ds�1) could be very large, but this can be relaxed by matching of m planes of the film with n of the substrate. This matching of integral multiples of lattice planes leaves a residual strain of �r given by�r��md f /nds�1�,�1�where m and n are simple integers.

The LME region is above about 12/13 ratio or below about 7.7% strain.Equation �4� basically governs the domain epitaxy, as plotted in Fig. 1. The basic assumption in our simple model is that there is a complete relaxation of the strain without any dis-location nucleation barrier, which is borne out by our in situ x-ray diffraction measurements. Figure 1 shows a general plot of misfit percent strain as a function of inverse of inte-gral multiple of planes matching across the interface. It should be noted that a 45° rotation in some cubic systemsTABLE I.

The table also includes the systems which fall in between the two domains where two domains alternate with a periodicity needed for a complete relaxation. The plot in Fig. 1 provides a unified framework of lattice matching and domain matching epitaxy with misfit strain ranging from 2% to 50% �50% corresponding to 1/2 matching�. If the domain matching is not perfect, epitaxy occurs by accommodating the additional misfit by changing the domain size, controlled by the parameter �. In this framework, it is important to realize that the nature of the dislocations remains the same, only their periodicity changes.

The relaxation process was found to be thermally ac-tivated because the ZnO thickness corresponding to full re-laxation decreased as the deposition temperature increased.24 The relaxation process requires the creation of dislocations, which involves nucleation and propagation of dislocations. Both of these steps are thermally activated. The nucleation barrier can be partially overcome by the surface steps,26and the propagation is very small in DME due to the proximity of the interface.FIG. 6. X-ray surface diffraction measurements along the (H, 0, �H, 0.3) direction showing the growth of ZnO films on sapphire with sapphire in-plane lattice parameter approaching H�0.845 corresponding to a fully re-laxed position after a few monolayers.LATTICE RELAXATION AND DEFECT REDUCTION PROCESSESThe rapid relaxation process in DME is consistent with the fact that the critical thickness under these large misfits is less than 1 monolayer.26As a result, dislocations can nucle-ate during initial stages of growth and confine most of the defects near the interface, leading to fewer defects in the active region of the device.

Cross section TEM micrograph of ZnO/ sapphire specimens undertwo different diffraction conditions (g¯vectors) showing a low density of threading dislocations, stacking faults and domain boundaries.

The ZnO films were grown by pulsed laser deposition at 790 °C. From these micrographs, the density of threading disloca-tions with Burgers vector b�1/3�112¯0� was estimated to be 107cm�2, which is 3 orders of magnitude lower than nor-mally observed for the misfit of this magnitude �15.44%�. The density of stacking faults �planar defects� was estimated to be 105cm�1. It is interesting to note that most of the dislocations and other defects �stacking faults and domain boundaries� are confined to the ZnO/sapphire interface as expected from the domain epitaxy growth.Since the critical thickness at which it becomes energeti-cally feasible for the film to contain dislocations is less than 1 monolayer, the dislocations nucleate at free-surface steps within 1 monolayer and locate at the interface where there is an energy minimum. An important consideration here is a large number density of surface steps within the monolayer, which can provide easy nucleation sites for dislocations. If the initial growth is 2D, the dislocations can propagate throughout the entire length of the film, and confine them-selves near the interface without creating threading disloca-tions. However, if the initial growth is a mixture of 2D and 3D growth then dislocation segments may not propagate throughout the entire length and threading segments may en-sue. Depending upon the nature of growth characteristics and the number density of surface steps, this characteristic of DME may be used to reduce the number density of threading dislocations and confine most of the misfit dislocations near the interface.On the other hand, if the critical thickness is large as in a low-misfit system, then the dislocations nucleate at the free-surface steps and then glide to the interface. The process creates a half-loop configuration with two threading seg-ments and a straight segment along the interface. Since there is a nucleation barrier for the dislocation, misfit is not fully relaxed.26In addition, threading segments do not expand to the edges due to the presence of other dislocations and ob-stacles, and as a result a high-density of these dislocations is retained within the film. Since these dislocations are purely glide or slip dislocations, their planes and Burgers are con-trolled by the slip systems of the film. The relaxation process in low misfit systems is gradual due to this nucleation barrier, leading to a large number of threading dislocations. Thus, in the DME framework, the films having larger misfits can be grown with fewer defects in the active region.",1003
narayan_domain_matching_epitaxy_JAP_2003.docx,CONCLUSION,"We have provided the concept of domain epitaxy for thin film growth having a small as well as large misfit strain with the substrate. We have shown that by matching integral mul-tiples of major planes between the film and the substrate, it is possible to grow films with small as well as large misfits. We have discovered that systematic variations in domain sizes are created to accommodate misfits that fall between the in-tegral multiples. As the domain size changes, the nature of the dislocations remains the same. For large misfit strains, the critical thickness is less than 1 to 2 monolayers, so dis-locations corresponding to full lattice relaxation are gener-ated at or within 1 monolayer of the interface; and the re-mainder of the film can be grown virtually strain and misfit-dislocation free. Thus, the DME concept can be used to engineer and confine misfit strains near the interface, and films with larger misfits can be grown with a fewer number of defects in the active regions, compared to the films with smaller misfits grown by LME. We have recently shown that the number density of dislocations can be reduced consider-ably by utilizing a two-step growth procedure for large mis-match systems. In the first step, 1–2 monolayers are grown and given time for all the dislocations to be formed corre-sponding to full lattice relaxation. Then, in the second step, the film is grown virtually strain free with a substantially lower density of threading dislocations. The nature of misfit dislocations in terms of Burgers vectors and habit planes are determined by geometrical constraints, rather than by defor-mation in the normal slip systems. This is similar to the observations of unusual dislocation structures at the grain boundaries formed as a result of geometrical constraints. The formation of a/2�100� dislocations in �111� planes in TiN has been shown to be a result of geometrical constraints dur-ing domain epitaxy on the Si�100� substrate. Thus, domain epitaxy provides a mechanism to grow epitaxial films on substrates with large misfits, and opens a new frontier in next-generation solid state technology.",472

Ferroelectric (FE) materials, exhibit switchable spontaneous polarization, and are of great technological interest for a myriad of applications, notably as memories and field-effect transistors in microelectronics1, spintronics2, and micro/nano electro-mechanical systems3.. However, miniaturizing ferroelectrics is not an easy task, since depolarization fields become increasingly important at reduced sizes.4,5 Searching for robust FE properties at the nanoscale has been, therefore, a recurrent challenge over the past decades.. Thus, the recent discovery of ferroelectricity in ultrathin layers of the HfO2-based materials6 represents a real breakthrough in the field, and seems to expose a new type of ferroelectricity: one that only appears at the nanoscale and becomes better at smaller dimensions.. In addition, silicon compatibility, the simplicity of their chemistry and low toxicity make them very attractive compared to the other commonly used FE layers..

Furthermore, an epitaxial relation between the substrate and the film with [1-10]HZO//[1-10]STO, and [11-2]HZO//[110]STO, can be clearly identified. Next, we performed cross-sectional high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) analyses on 4 nm and 9 nm thick films, along zone-axes (ZA) defined by φ=0o ([100]STO), φ=15o and φ=45o ([110]STO).

From the fast Fourier transform (FFT) (inset, Fig 3b) across many images, we deduce that d111=2.95-3.01 Å and d11-1=2.92-2.96 Å. These values (d111 ≠ d11-1) provide a clear confirmation of the non-orthorhombic nature of this phase (see Supplementary Fig. S1 for analysis based on forbidden spots) and support the rhombohedral phase revealed by the synchrotron XRD measurements (Fig. 2b). Fig. 3c displays a HAADF-STEM image from a 4 nm thick sample (ZA, φ=15o), where we observe the coexistence of different (111)-oriented domains. Notably, (001)-oriented areas are only rarely found at these low thicknesses. (See Supplementary Fig. S2). We analyzed the chemistry and structure of the interface between HZO and LSMO through energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) performed in conjunction with HAADF-STEM. Comparison of the EDS chemical maps with the HAADF-STEM image (ZA, φ=0o), reveals the presence, at the interface with LSMO, of 2-3 monolayers of HZO that are in a different phase in comparison with the rest of the HZO film (Supplementary Fig. S3). This interfacial HZO phase is completely strained to the substrate (a=3.91 Å), which corresponds to a huge (~8%) in-plane tensile strained t-phase (a=3.60 Å in unstrained t-phase), as shown in Fig. 3d (see also Supplementary Fig. S3c for HAADF simulations).

After the above-mentioned two atomic layers at the interface, the r-phase grows under compressive strain. With increasing thickness, the m-phase in the [001]-orientation appears (Supplementary Fig. S4), also in agreement with the x-ray diffraction data. In order to test the FE behavior of the films, we obtained polarization versus voltage (P-V) loops through PUND (positive up negative down) measurements (Supplementary Fig. S5).46 Bi-stable switching and hysteresis loops can be observed in Fig. 4 for 5 nm and 9 nm-thick films. After subtracting the non-switching dielectric contribution, the blue lines only show the FE switching current with coercive field, Ec, around 5 MV/cm and 3 MV/cm, respectively, consistent with the expected dependence of Ecwith thickness (d) as 𝐸𝑐~𝑑−2/3. The coercive fields are larger than the 1 MV/cm reported in ALD-grown films32. This could be due to the dead layers at the interface with the LSMO electrodes as discussed previously. According to our knowledge, the highest remanent polarization (Pr) reported in HZO is 26 μC/cm2 (with switching polarization of 45 μC/cm2 ), using a TiN capping layer of at least 90 nm.32 In our 5 nm-thick HZO films, Pr also reaches record values of around 34 μC/cm2 compared to other epitaxial PLD films24. These values are large even when compared with very good conventional perovskites, such as unstrained BaTiO3 47. However, for the thicker 9 nm film, Prdrops significantly to 18 μC/cm2. This finding can be rationalized by our TEM observations showing that the minority (001)-oriented domains (Fig. 3b) and m-phase (non-FE), which are absent or very rarely found in the thinnest sample, gradually appear with increasing thickness (Supplementary Fig. S4). It is interesting to note that the FE loops to be obtained readily after growth, without the technologically inconvenient wake-up cycling required for other HZO systems48,49 indicating that the FE rhombohedral phase is stabilized by the compressive epitaxial strain. Finally, we resorted to first-principles simulations to try to identify the rhombohedral HZO phase observed in our films. Since we are not aware of any previous report on a polar rhombohedral polymorph of HZO, we ran a blind search for (meta)stable structures, using the genetic-algorithm approach implemented in USPEX50–52. For this we employed standard first-principles methods53–55, based on density functional theory, and a simulation supercell of 12 atoms (see Methods for details). We ran our search for pure HfO2 and pure ZrO2 compositions in bulk-like conditions. We obtained in both cases an R3m structure with a small polarization of the order of 0.1 μC/cm2. Furthermore, for the HfO2 composition we also found a second polymorph with R3 symmetry and a polarization of 41 μC/cm2. These rhombohedral phases lie above the P21/c bulk ground state that is usually discussed in the literature on HfO2, which explains why they have not been previously reported or observed. More precisely, from our calculations we obtain E(R3m)-E(P21/c) = 158 meV/f.u. and E(R3)-E(P21/c) = 195 meV/f.u. for HfO2. Note that the polar Pca21 phase of hafnia discussed in the literature is also more stable than these rhombohedral polymorphs, as we obtain E(Pca21)- E(P21/c) = 64 meV/f.u. (in agreement with Ref. 33, which reports 62 meV/f.u. for this energy gap). More details on these structures are provided as Supplementary Information. We then considered these two rhombohedral structures with the HZO composition, to discover that, upon substitution of Hf by Zr, the R3 phase loses its stability in favor of the weakly-polar R3m polymorph. We studied several Hf-Zr arrangements compatible with the 3-fold symmetry, and observed that the R3 destabilization occurs in all cases. The R3m phase of bulk-like HZO is characterized by d111 ~ 2.94 Å and P ~ 1 μC/cm2. Then, we examined the effect of epitaxial compression by running simulations for a number of fixed values of the lattice constants in the (111) plane of the HZO R3m structure, allowing for the relaxation of atoms and the out-of-plane lattice vector. As shown in Fig. 5, for an epitaxial compression corresponding to an out-of-plane d111 ~ 3.25 Å, we observe a clear structural transition to a phase that retains the R3m symmetry but is strongly polar, with P ~ 15 μC/cm2. Note that this d111 value is within the range of what we observe in our thinnest HZO films (for our films with thickness between 1.5 nm and 9 nm, we estimate d111 values ranging between ~ 3.27 Å and 2.98 Å, respectively, from the XRD measurements in Fig. 1b).

Noheda_Epitaxial_HZO_LSMO_STO_2018.docx,experiment,"s strongly suggest that in the initial stages of the growth, after the formation of a fully coherent, atomically thin, interfacial layer, the internal pressure due to the small particle size favors the undistorted cubic phase.. As established by Navrostky et al.56, the (111) crystal face of ZrO2 and HfO2 is energetically favorable, so cubic crystallites growing with that orientation are expected.. Due to the favorable epitaxial relationships induced by the STO/LSMO stack (see Fig.. 3a), the growing crystallites are subjected to a large epitaxial compressive strain that elongates the cubic unit cell along the out-of-plane [111] direction, inducing rhombohedral symmetry with a polar unit cell (as shown by the synchrotron XRD and FE characterization).. Increasing the thickness allows the crystal size to grow, relieving the internal pressure, thus favoring the monoclinic bulk structure.. At the same time, the presence of the secondary m-phase also helps to release the elastic energy of the compressively strained structure.. Even though XRD only shows traces of the m-phase for thicknesses above ~10 nm, the TEM analysis shows that monoclinic (001)-oriented crystallites are already present in the 9 nm thick film (Supplementary Fig.. S4).. To conclude, we show that strain engineering can be used in very thin films of HZO to induce a previously unreported ferroelectric rhombohedral phase, with a large Pr of up to 34 μC/cm2.. The insight gained in this work provides the missing clues in the understanding of robust ferroelectricity in thin hafnia-based systems and also helps to overcome one of the main issues for their device utilization: the so-called wake-up cycling.. Our theoretical calculations predict an even larger polarization for the rhombohedral phases of Hf-rich compositions, and comparable values for epitaxially compressed HZO structures.. In addition, this work suggests a pathway to generate large FE polarization in nano-crystallites of simple oxides, whose rich phase diagrams include low volume cubic, tetragonal and rhombohedral phases, and in particular in materials with a clear preference for one specific crystal orientation.. These highly-oriented cubic phases can be stabilized during growth and deformed into a polar structure via epitaxial strain..",515

Thomas_SiHfO2_FET_IEEEDMR_2012.docx,Abstract,"—Reliability characteristics of ferroelectric thin films (10 nm) based on Si-doped HfO2 have been investigated with focus on potential memory applications. Extensive retention, imprint, and endurance data for this new type of ferroelectric material are presented for the first time. The variability of reliability characteristics in terms of capacitor annealing temperatures as well as excitation amplitude effects is analyzed. Stable ferroelectric switching behavior can be observed in a wide temperature range from 80 K up to 470 K. Bake tests at 125◦C show almost no retention loss for saturated polarization states up to cumulative testing times of 1000 h. In addition to the same-state retention, opposite-state retention was observed to be equally stable. Tradi-tional imprint behavior of the programmed state occurs after a few hours of baking time, and stable behavior could be verified until the end of the 1000-h retention test. Endurance characteristics of the ferroelectric thin films are shown to depend significantly on the annealing temperature of the capacitors and on the cycling voltage during testing. In thin films which had been annealed at 1000◦C, breakdown at 2 MV/cm limits endurance after 108 cycles. A lower annealing temperature of 650◦C could improve the breakdown-limited endurance to 1010cycles.IndexTerms—Endurance,ferroelectricHfO2,imprint,retention, temperature stability.I.",312

Thomas_SiHfO2_FET_IEEEDMR_2012.docx,EXPERIMENT,"SReliability characterizations were carried out on planar metal–insulator–metal (MIM) capacitors using dielectrics man-ufactured by atomic layer deposition (ALD).In detail, a TiN bottom electrode (10 nm) was deposited first onto HF cleaned silicon substrates inside an ALD batch furnace using TiCl4 and NH3 precursors at a temperature of 450◦C. The functional Si:HfO2 thin film (10 nm) was then deposited at 266◦C using a single wafer ALD furnace and tetrakisethyl-methylaminohafnium (TEMAH), tetrakisdi-methylaminosilane (4DMAS) as well as ozone as precursor gases.

Thomas_SiHfO2_FET_IEEEDMR_2012.docx,DISCUSSION,"As a first test, the initial poling dependence of the MIM capacitors was investigated by cycling the samples up to 103 times and measuring the hysteretic charge–voltage relationship in logarithmic steps (after 10, 102and 103cycles at 3 V ampli-tude). Fig. 1 shows the evolution of the polarization hysteresis with increasing amount of cycling as well as the final sub-loop (1.5 V) and saturated (3 V) behavior after this so called “wake-up” procedure [12]. It can be seen that neither the coercive field nor the remanent polarization is significantly affected by the initialization process. However, the annealing temperature seems to have strong influence on the remanent polarization since an increase from 8 μC/cm2over 13 μC/cm2up to1530-4388/$31.00 © 2012 IEEE94 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEVICE AND MATERIALS RELIABILITY, VOL. 13, NO. 1, MARCH 2013Fig. 1. Hysteresis behavior of the ferroelectric capacitors depending on the annealing temperature of the Si:HfO2 thin film. The left column shows the evolution of the polarization up to 1000 bipolar cycles at 3V. The right column shows the saturated and sub-loop behavior after the initialization process mentioned in the text.Fig. 2. Temperature dependent polarization characteristics for MIM capaci-tors annealed at different temperatures. Stable ferroelectric hysteresis can be observed in a wide temperature range.17 μC/cm2can be observed for annealing temperatures of 650◦C, 800◦C and 1000◦C, respectively.In order to investigate the temperature stability of the ferro-electric capacitors, polarization hysteresis was also tested in a wide temperature range from 80 K up to 470 K (Fig. 2).In comparison to previous publications on the thermal stabil-ity of ferroelectricSi:HfO2 [2], no transition to antiferroelectric-like behavior could be observed for the samples at hand. In fact, across the whole temperature range of almost 400 K only small deviations in remanent polarization were visible, mainly attributed to increased leakage current contributions at elevated temperatures. At lower temperatures a gradual increase in the coercive field as predicted by Landau-Ginzburg mean-field theory could be observed [13]. With respect to earlier studies on the temperature stability of Si:HfO2 thin films the authors would like to point out that these characteristics areFig. 3. Voltage pulse sequences used for same-state (SS), new same-state (NSS) and opposite-state (OS) retention tests. Calculation of the FRAM-specific retention values from the respective integrated current responses is shown below. Integration of the current response is performed across the complete transient range of the trapezoidal pulse.highly affected by the proper choice of silicon content inside the HfO2 host lattice. Hence, due to the stable characteristics of the MIM capacitors the concentration of 4.6 mol% can be considered very appropriate for the chosen process flow.Besides thermally stable switching characteristics, state re-tention is an essential necessity for any type of ferroelectric material used in non-volatile memory applications. Therefore, same-state (SS), new same-state (NSS) and opposite-state (OS) retention tests as known from state-of-the-art FRAM reliability characterizations [14] were performed for the Si:HfO2-based ferroelectric capacitors. The pulse schemes used for these tests are illustrated in Fig. 3.In order to measure the mentioned retention values, four MIM capacitors were used (Cap 1–Cap 4) and exposed to different pulse sequences. The calculation of the respective parameters is also shown in Fig. 3. The resulting current responses always have to be understood with respect to their previously written state. As an example, pulse 11 will only yield a purely dielectric response since the previously written state using pulse 14 is the same. On the other hand, pulse 21 will yield a ferroelectric switching current as well as a dielectric displacement current since the capacitor (Cap 2) resided in a“1” state before (due to the negative voltage polarity at the end of the pulse sequence for Cap 2). In between those pulsed tests, the samples were placed inside a furnace and baked at 125◦C in order to accelerate the retention and imprint behavior, respectively. The",988
Thomas_SiHfO2_FET_IEEEDMR_2012.docx,results,"are shown in Fig. 4.The retention tests were performed for samples annealed at different temperatures which were programmed/erased at either 1.5 V or 3 V. As mentioned before, states written at 1.5 V correspond to polarization sub-loops and states written at 3 V are fully saturated. In general, strong retention loss of non-saturated states could be observed after 1000-h bake time at 125◦C. This behavior was anticipated due to the fact that not fully polarized states are expected to be more prone to ther-mal depolarization than capacitors which had previously beenMUELLER et al.: RELIABILITY CHARACTERISTICS OF FERROELECTRIC Si:HfO2 FILMS 95Fig. 5. Imprint behavior for capacitors annealed at different temperatures forFig. 4. Same-state and opposite-state retention tests performed for samples annealed at different temperatures and programmed/erased at voltage levels of either 1.5 V or 3 V. The degradation of sub-loop states (1.5 V) is much more severe than for fully saturated states (3 V). Retention is improved at elevated annealing temperatures. PSW was normalized with respect to the initially switched polarization.written into a saturated state. Imprint behavior, as represented by opposite-state retention, showed no clear tendency for sub-loop states. Fully saturated states programmed/erased at 3 V showed a very clear and stable retention behavior up to 1000 h of bake time. Samples annealed at 650◦C showed some degradation of the opposite state whereas higher annealing temperatures significantly improved opposite-state retention so that inverse states could achieve up to at least 75% of the initially switched polarization. Referring to recent PZT data [14], the same-state and opposite-state retention characteristics can be considered comparatively stable.Regarding the suitability of ferroelectric Si:HfO2 thin films for different kinds of memory applications, the retention data was not only analyzed in terms of FRAM-based PSW but also with respect to FeFET-based characteristics. Therefore, a visualization of the shift in coercive fields (imprint) extracted from the retention tests is shown in Fig. 5.An immediate shift of the coercive fields toward the im-printed state is visible already after the first baking period (which can be extracted from the second data point in Fig. 3). After that, no severe additional degradation can be observed with increasing bake times up to 1000 h. Due to the fact that trapezoidal pulses with a 1 ms slope and holding time were used for the imprint tests, the contribution of the constant voltage stress at 3 V to the polarization hysteresis originates solely from leakage currents. As shown in Fig. 5, for the capacitors annealed at 1000◦C this causes an additional vertical offset of the right and left hysteresis branch due to the increased leakage current contribution for these samples. Referring again to FeFET-based applications, imprint effects shifting the co-ercive voltage are much more important than reduced PSWbake times up to 1000 h. Dashed lines represent initial polarization hysteresis and solid lines represent measurements after consecutive bake intervals as illustrated in Fig. 3. Clear imprint is visible within the first 100 h of baking. The offset of right and left hysteresis branch originates from the leakage current contribution occurring for the trapezoidal excitation signal.because of the small dependence of the threshold voltage on the remanent polarization [15]. Changes in the coercive fields, however, affect both the absolute position as well as the size of the memory window. Both are essential for the proper operation of FeFET-based memories.Another important measure for determining the suitability of ferroelectric materials for memory applications are the en-durance or sometimes also called fatigue characteristics. In materials like PZT severe fatigue will be observed during endurance tests if no oxide electrodes are used to construct the MIM capacitor. Therefore, the ferroelectric is exposed to a series of bipolar voltage cycles in order to emulate cumulative switching effects on the material characteristics. These tests were performed for samples annealed at the specified temper-atures and carried out at different voltages up to 1010cycles (Fig. 6).As mentioned before, capacitors annealed at higher tem-peratures clearly show increased remanent polarization values and therefore a larger switchable polarization. However, during endurance tests breakdown of the functional layer was observed much earlier for those samples. For instance, capacitors an-nealed at 1000◦C could only be cycled 105times at 2.5 V until breakdown whereas capacitors annealed at 650◦C could endure up to almost 108bipolar cycles at the same amplitude. This behavior can be explained by stronger diffusion of defects and titanium/nitrogen into Si:HfO2 along the grain boundaries of the polycrystalline film. A larger amount of defects and vacan-cies leads to higher leakage currents and therefore to degraded reliability [16]. In comparison to ferroelectrics like PZT or SBT, which predominantly show fatigue, i.e., a gradual reduction of the remanent polarization with cycling. The cycling endurance for Si:HfO2 ferroelectrics is in contrast by hard breakdown.96 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEVICE AND MATERIALS RELIABILITY, VOL. 13, NO. 1, MARCH 2013Fig. 6. Endurance characteristics of ferroelectric Si:HfO2 MIM capacitors. A clear correlation between switchable polarization and endurance until break-down is visible. Samples annealed at higher temperatures show larger remanent polarization but also earlier breakdown. On the right, the evolution of hysteresis (2 V amplitude) with cycling is shown.However, considering the fact that the coercive field of these new type of ferroelectric material is significantly higher than the one of PZT or SBT, this behavior can be anticipated.IV.",1299

Eng_SiGe_FEFET_EDL_2020.docx,results,"in a purely ferroelectric and symmetric behavior, revealing only a slight increase in Pr with cycling.From grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) data, an increase of intensity for the [110] diffraction line of the monoclinic and/or orthorhombic phase for higher anneal-ing temperature is found (see Figure 2). This suggests a preferred in-plane orientation of the [110]-axes. Addition-ally, increased intensity of the [200] and [31¯1] lines are observed. Consequently, an out-of-plane texture of the [001]-axis appears likely. As the texture becomes less dominant with decreasing temperature, more [001]-axes will arrange closer to in-plane directions, enabling ferroelastic switching. Consequently, a much more pronounced wake-up effect is observed.After wake-up cycling, the samples annealed at lower tem-peratures show a stronger asymmetry of the switching voltages (see Figure 1), originating mainly from a strong reductionnot fully understood, interface defect densities could not be extracted. Nevertheless, for large voltage amplitudes, the hysteresis closes and capacitance values saturate, thus allowing the extraction of the combined oxide capacitance (Cox) of the two insulating layers at −5 V. Here, the extracted Cox shows a clear trend to lower values with increasing annealing temperature, as shown in Figure 3a. Since the XRD measurements (see Figure 2) shows no apparent differences, a significant change in the relative per-mittivity of this layer, due to amorphous regions and/or higher monoclinic phase, can be excluded. For investigating the SiO2 interface layer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were conducted.As shown in Figure 3b, a strongly increased thickness of the interface layer was found for samples annealed at 1000◦C. This agrees qualitatively with the C-V measurements, as an increase in interface layer thickness will result in a lower Cox of the MFIS stack. Quantitatively, on the other hand, the extracted interface layer thickness, with 1.0 nm and 0.3 nm forAuthorized licensed use limited to: Georgia Institute of Technology.

For the P-V loops of samples grown on heavily doped p-type silicon (d) only insignificant differences to HSO on SiGe are observed.Fig. 4.

Consequently, the relative permittivity of the layers may differ due to changes in the composition or crystallographic phase.Thinner interface layers will result in a lower depolarization field [22], which is contradictory to a stronger destabilization of the negative polarization state for samples annealed at lower temperatures. On the other hand, the relative retention loss is higher for thicker interfaces (see Figure 3c). Remarkably, the measurement shows a shift in the stability of the two states. While thinner interfaces show less retention loss for the negative state, the positive state is more stable in case of thicker interfaces. This highlights that charged defect states in the interface layer or a currently unknown contribution are affecting the stability/behavior of the polarization states. Improved understanding of the C-V hysteresis may help to extract charges and defect densities in the layers.From Figure 3d which shows a similar behavior of the ferroelectric layer for samples having a Si substrate, it can be further deduced that the aforementioned effects seem to be generally present in CMOS based MFIS stacks.Like in anti-ferroelectric behavior based devices [23], band engineering allows to superimpose an adapted bias field, thus rendering the I-V loops symmetric. This could enable to build less power consuming non-volatile memory devices due to the decreased switching voltage.on a SiGe epilayer while the n-FeFETs were structured on silicon on the same wafer. For writing the program and erase state, a square pulse with an amplitude of ±4.5 V (±4 V for n-FeFETs) and a pulse duration of 500 ns was applied. For each type a total of 72 devices were measured. The resulting transfer characteristics are displayed in Figure 4a and 4b for p- and n-FeFETs, respectively. The p-FeFET devices could achieve a memory window of 1.1 V. This value is quite similar to the n-FeFETs, with a memory window of 1.4 V. Additionally, low variability was achieved for both types. Furthermore, by applying pulses with increasing amplitude and erasing/programming each time in between, switching characteristics can be extracted for programming and erasing, respectively (see Figure 4c). Here, switching in the range of about 3.5 V is observed for both directions.IV.",1290

CSD is an inexpensive and flexible deposition technique with good adjustability of concentration and stoichiometry and is widely used for ferroelectric and piezoelectric ceramic thin films.11The dopant ratio was chosen, because it was reported to exhibit the highest remanent polarization in ALD deposited samples.5To confirm the ferroelectric prop-erties of the deposited films polarization-voltage (P-V), capacitance-voltage (C-V) and piezoelectric displacement measurements were performed.Planar metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors were manufactured on 1 in.2oxidized silicon substrates. 100 nm thick platinum bottom electrodes with a titanium dioxide ad-hesion layer were deposited by sputtering from a 6 in. target with 200 W at 150�C. For the preparation of the precursor solution, a hybrid-type routine was applied.12For the sol-gel-educt (hafnium ethoxide, Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), all prepa-rations were carried out under inert gas atmosphere by the use of standard Schlenk techniques and a glove box. The desired amount of hafnium ethoxide was weighted into a Schlenk flask and dry ethanol was added. After heating at60�C for 30 min in an oil bath, a transparent solution was formed, which was stabilized by adding one equivalent of 2,4-pentanedionate (Sigma-Aldrich, GC-grade) per hafnium ion. Yttrium 2,4-pentanedionate (Sigma Aldrich, 99.95%) was dissolved in a mixture (5:1) of propionic acid (Merck, f. s.) and propionic anhydride (Merck, f. s.) at 100�C.

Details of the growth and TEM characterization are published elsewhere.11In the present paper, the crystallographic analy-sis has been performed using a Philips X’pert MRD diffrac-tometer with Cu K�1 radiation ��=1.540 Å�.The lattice parameters are extracted from the perovskite pseudocubic 00l diffraction peaks �inset of Fig. 1�.16This allows the calculation of the average out-of-plane strain in each film, given by �¯�t�=c¯�t�/c0−1, where c¯ is the average out-of-plane lattice parameter, c0 is the bulk lattice parameter�cBST=3.95 Å�, and t is the film thickness. The average strain for each film is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. There is an out-of-plane expansion for the thinnest films that decreases with thickness, indicating relaxation of the in-plane compres-sion induced by the smaller lattice parameter of the bottom electrode �cSRO=3.93 Å�.Similar to what is known for semiconductor and metallic epitaxial layers, ferroelectric oxides are known to relieve strain as film thickness is increased.11,17The strain-relieving mechanism is thought to be mainly the formation of misfit dislocations. It is generally implied that this strain relaxation takes place at or very near the interface, and thus the strain state should be essentially homogeneous across the film�save for the first few monolayers� and depend only on the film’s total thickness: �=��t�. However, recent work shows strain that misfit dislocations are associated with distributions.18,19Furthermore, strain may also be relaxed by other mechanisms, such as vertical segregation of different-sized cations.20Thus, rather than a quantity dependent only on the thickness t, strain should be described as an internal profile dependent also on the distance z to the film-substrate interface: �=��z,t�. The homogeneous versus inhomoge-neous scenarios of strain relaxation have major consequences for the functional properties. Inhomogeneous strain fields around dislocations18,21and impurities22affect the polariza-tion and critical temperatures of ferroelectric thin films. Cru-cially, also, inhomogeneous strain is necessarily associated with strain gradients.In order to calculate the vertical strain gradients, x-ray diffraction peak broadening has been analyzed as a function of film thickness. There are three main contributions to peak broadening: the finite thickness of the sample, the inhomo-geneous strain, and the instrumental resolution of the diffrac-tometer. When the peak profile is Gaussian, the integral breadth �area of the peak divided by its height� is related to the partial breadths by �measured 2 =�strain 2 +�size 2 +�instrument .23 The instrumental contribution is calibrated separately using a reference single crystal, and the other two contributions have different angular dependences, so they can be separatedby looking at the peak width for different reflections andfitting the",1012

The existence of a maximum in �i is consis-tent with the presence of a monotonically decreasing internal strain profile as a function of z in the films: for very thin films there is a small dispersion in lattice parameters; con-versely, for very thick films there may be a larger dispersion, but the volume fraction of totally relaxed material is large and dominates the diffraction peak, so that again the variance is small.

Takagi_FeFET_split_CV_IEDM_2019.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Ferroelectric-gate field effect transistors (FeFET) have been continuously studied toward a number of applications such as non-volatile memory and in-memory computing [1,2]. Ferro-electric-gate negative-capacitance (NC) FETs have also been investigated as promising steep-slope devices [3]. The ferro-electric technology has been particularly boosted by the dis-covery of ferroelectricity in CMOS-compatible doped HfO2 [4]. In spite of intense studies on FeFETs, charge behaviors during the device operation is still not fully understood. Most studies so far have analyzed charge behaviors in FeFETs indirectly through Id-Vg characteristics, which is the output affected by many complicated mechanisms (Fig. 1). A typical way widely used to predict the characteristics of FeFETs is to extract the polarization-voltage (P-V) properties of the ferroelectric layer from separately prepared MFM (M: metal, F: ferroelectric) or MFS+ (S: semiconductor, +: high doping concentration) structures, and slightly modify the standard model of MOSFETs using Gauss’ law [5,6]. In this conventional approach, charges equivalent to the ferroelectric polarization is considered to be induced in the semiconductor. However, there has been no",287
Takagi_FeFET_split_CV_IEDM_2019.docx,experiment,"al report that large polarization P in typical ferroelectric materials, in the order of 10 μC/cm2 equivalent to more than 1014 cm-2 of surface charge density, can induce such a high inversion carrier density Ns in FETs, which must result in MOSFETs with extremely-high ION. It should be noted here that a split C-V measurement, a well-known method to evaluate Ns in MOSFET channels, is not applicable to FeFETs. Therefore, an alternative approach is required to reveal charge distributions in actual FeFETs. In this study, we propose a systematic approach with a combination of a novel P-V-measurement-inspired quasi-static split C-V and Hall measurements to evaluate the polarization switching and inversion charge behaviors in FeFETs. This method is applied to Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/Si-based MFIS-FeFET (I: insulator) to clarify, for the first time, the behaviors of electrons, holes, and trapped charges in MFIS interfaces and their roles in the operation of FeFETs. II.QUASI-STATIC SPLIT C-VTECHNIQUE A. Concept Split C-V is a classic method to evaluate the inversion charges in a MOSFET (Fig. 2). A small sinusoidal signal is applied to obtain the small-signal gate-channel capacitance Cgc, and the inversion charge density Qs is obtained by integrating Cgc. In FeFETs, however, spontaneous polarization responses only to the first Vg step (Fig. 3). Smaller capacitance is measured by small-signal C-V (Fig. 3 (ii) to (iii)), hindering us from obtaining the actual Qs-Vg characteristics (Fig. 3 (i) to (ii)). Here, we propose a quasi-static (QS) split C-V technique to evaluate the Qs-Vg relation in FeFETs (Fig. 4(a)). Triangular-shape Vg covering a full voltage range of interest (Fig. 4(b)) is applied to obtain large-signal Cgc through the relation C = I/(dV/dt) (Fig. 4(c)). Since the Vg scan is kept in one direction until it reaches maximum or minimum, the ferroelectric polarization does not fall into small-signal minor loops and the actual Qs-Vg relation can be obtained (Fig. 4(d)). Note that, similar to the conventional split C-V, trapped charges may be included in the obtained Qs. Due to the principle similar to ferroelectric P-V measurements, applying triangular voltages to measure total charges, it is interesting to note that a commercial P-V measurement setup can be employed for the proposed QS split C-V technique (Fig. 5). If S/D and back contacts are both connected to the current/charge measurement terminal, total charges in/out of the semiconductor when Vg is applied can be measured. On the other hand, if only the S/D (back) contact is connected while the other is grounded, the contribution from minority carriers (majority carriers) can be separately evaluated. B.Sample Preparation The fabrication process flow is shown in Fig. 6. A p-Si substrate (NA = 4×1015 cm-3) was cleaned and chemically oxidized to form a thin SiO2 IL. 10-nm-thick ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 was then stacked by ALD before capped by TiN electrode. After the FET fabrication process, the device was annealed at 400°C for 30 seconds in N2 atmosphere to form the ferroelectric phase in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2.As a reference, a non-ferroelectric MOSFET was also prepared by the same process except that 10-nm Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 was replaced by 10-nm HfO2. Fig. 7 shows TEM images of both samples, indicating 0.7-nm SiO2 IL at the Si interfaces. C.",918

When the FeFET is applied with a wider Vg range of -2 V to 3.5 V, Id-Vg characteristics with ferroelectric hysteresis (Fig. 8(c)) can be observed. No S.S. below 60 mV/dec due to the transient NC effect appears with a slow Vg scan rate of 0.1 V/s, which is close to the QS condition [7]. Fig. 9 shows the current response of the non-ferroelectric HfO2 MOSFET from QS C-V using 200-Hz triangular Vg with S/D and back contacts connected.

While C-V and QS C-V give 978-1-7281-4032-2/19/$31.00 ©2019 IEEE23.7.1IEDM19-570similar capacitance values when the FeFET is operated in a small Vg range, where the spontaneous polarization does not response (Fig. 13), prominent discrepancy between both capacitance values can be clearly observed when polarization switching occurs (Fig. 14). The capacitance, i.e. displacement current, peaks indicating polarization switching can be observed from Cg in Fig. 14(a). As mostly-full two polarization switching peaks appear, we can say that this device well operates as a hysteretic FeFET in this voltage range. By integrating Cg and compensating the influence of the DC gate leakage current IDC (Fig. 15), we demonstrate, for the first time, that the polarization-gate voltage (P-Vg) hysteresis loop can be directly measured in FeFET structures by employing the measurement setup of Fig. 5(left), as shown in Fig. 16(b). Integration of Cgc and Cgb, denoted by QSD and QB respectively, provides the contribution of minority and majority carriers in the current flowing in/out of Si when the FeFET operates along the P-Vg trajectory in Fig. 16(b). QSD and QB in/out of FeFET are shown in Fig. 16(a). One interesting behavior can be seen from the open loop of QSD that, unlike typical MOSFETs in Fig. 10-12, most of electrons flowing from S/D of the MOSFET do not come out through the same route. (Note that QSD and QB obtained by capacitance integration gives the charge increment ΔQ, not the remaining charges.) Instead, they flow out into the back contact through the p-Si substrate. The schematic is illustrated in Fig. 16(c), suggesting that electrons induced at high positive Vg are emitted into the substrate and recombine with holes. Moreover, QSD exhibits surprisingly large Ns, which includes both inversion layer charges and trapped charges, in the order of 1014 cm-2 (Fig. 17). III.HALL MEASUREMNET In order to understand these unusual charge behaviors in the FeFET, the Hall measurement was performed in the non-ferroelectric HfO2 MOSFET and the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 FeFET. The device size is W/L = 100/280 mm with a Hall bar structure as shown in Fig. 18. These test devices were fabricated on the same substrates as devices described in Section II. To minimize the electrical stress induced from applied large DC voltage, the Hall voltage VH was measured during a Vg scan with a rate of 0.1 V/s. Fig. 19-20 show Id-Vg and VH-Vg of the HfO2 MOSFET and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 FeFET. The surface carrier densities Ns extracted from VH, with the influence of Ig compensated by a method in [8] and the Hall factor assumed to be one, are plotted as triangle symbols in Fig. 12(a) for the HfO2 MOSFET, Fig. 12(b) for the standard SiO2 MOSFET, and Fig. 17 for the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 FeFET. While a good agreement among Ns from Hall, split C-V, and QS split C-V measurements can be confirmed in the non-ferroelectric MOSFETs, Ns from the Hall measurement (mobile charges; Q s Hall ) of the FeFET is more than one order of magnitude lower than Ns from QS split C-V (total charges; Qtotal), implying that a large portion of minority carriers in the FeFET are trapped and do not contribute to the channel current. Under the assumption that trapped charge Qtrap is given by Qtotal - Q s Hall , Qtrap and the Qtrap / Q s Hall ratio are plotted in Fig. 21. This finding is consistent with the result observed in Fig. 16(c): most electrons flowing from S/D are trapped somewhere in the gate oxide, and subsequently are released and recombined with holes in the substrate. Since the actual Ns can be obtained in this study, we are able to extract the inversion layer mobility of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 FeFET. Compared to the typical Hall mobility μH extracted from the HfO2 MOSFET (Fig. 22), μH in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 FeFET fabricated with the same process significantly degrades in a low-field region (Fig. 23), suggesting that a Coulomb scattering-like process dominates channel electron conduction. Since acceptable S.S. in the FeFET at low Vg is obtained (Fig. 8(e)) and the similar μH reduction is not observed in the HfO2 MOSFET even at high Vg(Fig. 22(b)), the μH degradation in the FeFET is attributed to the characteristics inherent to ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2. It is interesting to point out the hysteretic μH-Ns relation of the FeFET in Fig. 24. This suggests that μH is not a simple function of Ns as expected in conventional MOSFETs, but also dependent on the ferroelectric polarization state, implying the existence of a possible polarization-enhanced scattering process in FeFET channels. IV.ANALYSIS OF FEFETOPERATION Based on the above analysis, a plausible charge distribution in FeFETs when the spontaneous polarization is saturated at the ON state is shown in Fig. 25. To verify our model, the theoretical P-V characteristics of FeFETs without Qtrap is calculated using the linear-scaling model for minor loops [9] and depicted in Fig. 26. Here, the bias condition in each diagram corresponds to the labels shown in Fig. 16. When there is no Qtrap, large polarization in the ferroelectric layer",1422

Note that theoretical coercive gate voltage difference Vg (P→ = 0)−Vg (P← = 0), estimated for this structure, amounts to ~8 V. On the other hand, our",106
Takagi_FeFET_split_CV_IEDM_2019.docx,results,"indicate that the large polarization in the ferroelectric layer is screened by trapped charges to limit the field EIL in IL, similar to the phenomenon reported in MFIM structures [10]. In MFIS-FeFETs, polarization screening consequently limits carriers Ns in the inversion layer (Fig. 27(b)). Trapped charges cannot be easily de-trapped until EIL changes its direction, and eventually, emitted into the Si substrate and recombine with holes in the substrate when the spontaneous polarization is switched to the opposite direction. The charge movement observed during the subthreshold region, which should be suppressed theoretically in FeFETs (thin solid line in Fig. 26), is an evidence that a significant amount of trapped charges are released when the Si surface potential is modulated. With screening due to trapped charges, voltage drop across IL is expected to be suppressed, which is consistent with the clear polarization switching current peaks in Fig. 14 with a small peak-to-peak gap of 3.6 V. Our proposed approach can effectively explore the charge behaviors in FeFETs and clarify the operation mechanism. In the present demonstration, the measurement condition has been limited to the quasi-static operation to avoid any complications induced by the ferroelectric transient effect. On the other hand, we can also apply this powerful method to judge whether a specific FeFET whose S.S. is below 60 mV/dec is boosted by the quasi-static or transient NC effects. Here, quasi-static NCFETs should give non-hysteretic P-Vg loops and the same gate capacitances between small-signal split C-V and QS split C-V measurements. V.",359

However, miniaturizing ization, and are of great technological interest for a myriad of applications, notably in microelectronics1, spintronics2 and erroelectric materials exhibit switchable spontaneous polar- ferroelectrics is not an easy task, since depolarization fields become increasingly important at reduced sizes4,5.. Searching for robust fer-roelectric properties at the nanoscale has therefore been a recurrent challenge.. Thus, the recent discovery of ferroelectricity in ultrathin layers of HfO2-based materials6 represents a real breakthrough in the field, and seems to expose a new type of ferroelectricity: one that appears only at the nanoscale and becomes stronger at smaller dimensions.. In addition, silicon compatibility, the simplicity of their chemistry and low toxicity make them very attractive compared to the other commonly used ferroelectric layers.. In bulk, the stable form of HfO2 (ZrO2)-based compounds is a monoclinic phase (P21/c, m-phase) at room temperature7,8.. Other common high-temperature and high-pressure phases, namely, tetragonal (P42/nmc, t-phase) and cubic ( Fm m , c-phase) phases7,8, can be stabilized at room temperature via doping9 or nanostructur-ing10,11.. In addition, rhombohedral phases (r-phase) have also been obtained by doping and applying mechanical stress12–15.. The t- and r-phases are distortions from the fluorite structure (c-phase) and have a significantly lower volume than the m-phase.. None of the above-mentioned phases is reported to be polar.. A polar orthorhombic phase (Pca21, o-phase) was first reported for Mg-doped ZrO2 when cooled to cryogenic temperatures16.. This polar phase is believed to be the structural origin for the recently reported ferroelectricity in HfO2-based thin films6..

Furthermore, an epitaxial relation between the substrate and the film with [1-10]HZO//[1-10]STO, and [11-2]HZO//[110]STO, can be clearly identified.. Next, we performed cross-sectional high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) analyses on 4-nm- and 9-nm-thick films, along zone axes defined by φ= 0° ([100]STO), φ= 15° and φ= 45° ([110]STO).. Figure 3b displays a HAADF-STEM image from a 9-nm-thick sample (zone axis, φ= 45°), clearly show-ing the coexistence of majority and minority HZO domains with the [111]HZO and [001]HZO out-of-plane, respectively, in agree-ment with the XRD data.. From the fast Fourier transform (inset, Fig.. 3b) across many images, we deduce that d111= 2.95–3.01 Å and d11–1= 2.92–2.96 Å.. These values (d111≠d11–1) provide a clear confirmation of the non-orthorhombic nature of this phase (see Supplementary Fig.. 1 for analysis based on forbidden spots) and support the rhombohedral phase revealed by the synchrotron XRD measurements (Fig.. 2b)..

PLD growth of the thin films at high temperature enables the in situ crystallization of HZO. As previously proposed for hafnia-based ferroelectrics, the small particle sizes induce the formation of low-volume fluorite-like phases (either tetragonal or cubic)39–41. A plane-view bright-field TEM image (Supplementary Fig. 9) from a 9 nm HZO film shows an average grain size of ~10 nm. Our exper-iments strongly suggest that in the initial stages of the growth, after the formation of a fully coherent, atomically thin interfacial layer, the internal pressure due to the small particle size favours the undis-torted cubic phase.

The arrows show the polar distortion with respect to a reference paraelectric structure with R m symmetry, which we deduce by appropriately symmetrizing the R3m state. d, Detailed view of the Hf/Zr–O groups that characterize the R3m structure, allowing the main polar displacements, and how they preserve the three-fold axis, to be more easily appreciated.(111) crystal face of ZrO2 and HfO2 is energetically favourable, so cubic crystallites growing with that orientation are expected. Due to the favourable epitaxial relationships induced by the STO/LSMO stack (see Fig. 3a), the growing crystallites are subjected to a large epitaxial compressive strain that elongates the cubic unit cell along the out-of-plane [111] direction, inducing rhombohedral symmetry with a polar unit cell (as shown by the synchrotron XRD and fer-roelectric characterization).Increasing the thickness allows the crystal size to grow, reliev-ing the internal pressure, thus favouring the monoclinic bulk struc-ture. At the same time, the presence of the secondary m-phase also helps to release the elastic energy of the compressively strained structure. Even though XRD shows only traces of the m-phase for thicknesses above ~10 nm, the TEM analysis shows that monoclinic (001)-oriented crystallites are already present in the 9-nm-thick film (Supplementary Fig. 4).While the stabilization of a high-lying rhombohedral poly-morph of HZO may seem surprising, similar achievements have been accomplished for other ferroelectric thin films (for example, the super-tetragonal phase of perovskite oxide BiFeO3 on compres-sive substrates52). Moreover, the polymorphic character of HfO2 and ZrO2 should facilitate the stabilization of unconventional structures under epitaxial constraints. The evolution of the polarization with the epitaxial constraint reported here (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 10) mimics the behaviour that is typical among ferroelectric perovskite oxides53,54, suggesting that the connections between these two families should be further explored.Outlook We show that strain engineering can be used in very thin films of HZO to induce a ferroelectric rhombohedral phase, with a large Pr of 34 μ C cm−2. Further work is required to tackle issues associated with the strain requisite, such as larger coercive fields or more com-plex integration in three-dimensional architectures. The insights gained in this work provide the missing clues in the understanding of robust ferroelectricity in thin hafnia-based systems, and also help to overcome one of the main issues for their device utilization: the wake-up cycling. Our theoretical calculations predict an even larger polarization for the rhombohedral phases of Hf-rich compositions, and comparable values for epitaxially compressed HZO struc-tures. In addition, this work suggests a pathway to generate large ferroelectric polarization in nanocrystallites of simple oxides, whose rich phase diagrams include cubic, tetragonal and rhombohedral phases, and in particular in materials with a clear preference for one specific crystal orientation. These highly oriented cubic phases can be stabilized during growth and deformed into a polar structure via epitaxial strain. Furthermore, the highly epitaxial growth of ultra-thin ferroelectric hafnia-based films on LSMO has great potential for multiferroic tunnel junctions.Online content Any methods, additional",1254

Thin films of HZO with thicknesses in the range of 1.5–27 nm were grown by PLD on LSMO-buffered (001)-STO substrates. A KrF excimer laser with a wavelength of 248 nm was used to ablate polycrystalline targets of LSMO (purchased from PI-KEM, as the bottom electrode) and sequentially, HZO (home-made). LSMO was deposited using a laser fluence of 1 J cm−2 and a laser frequency of 1 Hz under a 0.15 mbar oxygen atmosphere and a substrate temperature of 775 °C. A ceramic HZO target (monoclinic P21/c phase) was synthesized at 1,400 °C by solid-state reaction, starting from HfO2 (99% purity) and ZrO2 (99.5% purity) powders. A fluence of 1.1 J cm−2 and repetition rate of 2 Hz was employed to grow the HZO films. The deposition was performed in an oxygen pressure of 0.1 mbar while keeping the substrates at a temperature of 800 °C. After deposition, the film was cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C min−1 under an oxygen pressure of 300 mbar.X-ray structural characterization. The structure and orientation of the films was characterized by XRD, using a Panalytical X’pert Pro diffractometer operating in two modes: using the line focus of the incident beam for high-resolution θ–2θ specular scans, which provide the lattice parameters; and using the point focus of the incident beam, for high-intensity/medium-resolution measurements of pole figures, which involve scanning φ (azimuthal angle) and χ (tilt of the sample plane around the incident beam direction) while the detector is fixed at a particular Bragg reflection. Synchrotron diffraction measurements were performed at the P08 High Resolution Diffraction Beamline in PETRA III, with a wavelength of λ= 1.378 Å, using a Kohzu six-circle diffractometer and a two-dimensional Pilatus 100k detector.Electron microscopy and EDS. Cross-sectional and plan-view specimens for electron microscopy were prepared via the standard procedure of mechanical grinding and polishing the samples down to 100 μ m, and dimpling (Gatan) followed by ion milling (PIPS II) to electron transparency. Some cross-sections were also prepared via the focused ion beam (Helios 660 ThermoFischer Scientific) technique, and both preparations yielded similar",919
Noheda_HZO_rhombohdral_NatMat_2018.docx,results,". Electron microscopy and EDS were performed on a Titan G2, Cs-corrected TEM equipped with an extreme field-emission gun and a Super X EDS system with four solid-state detectors placed symmetrically along the optical axes. Atomic-resolution imaging was performed in the HAADF-STEM mode, where the intensity in the image is ~Z2, thus yielding a clear atomic number contrast. Images were analysed using ImageJ, TIA-ES Vision and Digital micrograph. EDS was performed simultaneously with image acquisition in the HAADF-STEM mode. Chemical maps were acquired for 30 min with conditions optimized and collected at thousands of X-ray photons per second, and analysed using Bruker e-spirit software.Electrical measurements. LSMO top electrodes were deposited by PLD with the same growth condition as the bottom LSMO electrodes, as described in the `Thin-film synthesis’ section. LSMO top-electrode pads with different sizes were processed by physical etching (ion milling). Planar LSMO/HZO/LSMO capacitors were measured using a ferroelectric tester (AiXACCT, TF analyser 2000). The ferroelectric response of the films was tested via PUND55 measurements, which are able to separate switching currents from other contributions.Simulation methods. For our structural predictions, we used the USPEX code48–50, which is based on genetic algorithms. We applied this method to search for possible rhombohedral phases of HfO2 and ZrO2 in bulk-like conditions. We considered 12-atom cells for HfO2 and ZrO2. After the blind structural search, we ran additional first-principles simulations for HfO2, ZrO2 and HZO compositions focusing on the discovered R3 and R3m phases. For the HZO composition, we considered several representative Hf/Zr arrangements that preserve the three-fold rotation axis, using a 72-atom cell.NAtuRE MAtERiALS | www.nature.com/naturematerialsOur first-principles simulations were carried out using the VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package) code56,57. We used the PBEsol approximation to density functional theory58. Atomic cores were treated within the projector-augmented wave approach59, and we solved explicitly for the following electrons: 5p, 6s and 5d for Hf; 4s, 4p, 5s and 5d electrons for Zr; and 2s and 2p electrons for O. We represented the electronic wavefunctions in a plane-wave basis, cutoff at 500 eV. For the ground state of the bulk HfO2 (P21/c) with lattice parameters (a, b, c) of about (5.1, 5.2, 5.2) Å, a mesh of 8 × 8 × 8 k-points was used for Brillouin zone integrations; similarly dense grids were used in all other simulations in this work. When doing the structural relaxation, the calculations were stopped for residual forces below 0.005 eV A−1. To simulate the effect of epitaxial strain, we used a hexagonal-like cell with in-plane lattice vectors forming an angle of 120o, and the third lattice vector perpendicular to the plane. The in-plane vectors were fixed at a series of values, smaller ones corresponding to stronger in-plane compression; then the out-of-plane vector, and the atomic positions, were relaxed.We tested the influence of the density functional in our",780

The P-E hysteresis curves were measured to extract the 2Pr at 20 kHz using a semicon-ductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200-SCS). For the pulse write/read measurement (see supplementary material),5 a series of write and read trapezoidal voltage pulses with a pulse width of 4 ls, a rising/falling time of 1 ls, and a delay time of 10 ls were applied to the MIM capacitors using a pulse generator (Agilent 81110A) and an internal resistance of 50 X as a shunt resistor [Fig. 1(c)]. The measured load currents are integrated in order to calculate the polarization. By subtracting these integrated current values of the switch-ing and the non-switching pulses, it is possible to extract the real FE switching polarization (Psw).

When the read voltage is much lower than the coercive voltage, the extracted er (�Ec) is similar to the er obtained from the small signal capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurement (50 mV level) at 2.5 MV/cm where the FE switching effect is minimized.5Meanwhile, the extracted er (�Ec) at or above the coercive voltage in the non-switching pulse write/read measurement is close to the maximum er in the small signal C-V measurement at the coercive voltage, which includes a FE domain switching component due to the voltage bias sweeping. This implies that the FE switching component in the non-switching mode is attributed by FE domain reversal possibly due to the depo-larization effect during large signal measurements.All of the HZO samples were found to exhibit a pinched hysteresis loop before wake-up field cycling (i.e., pristine state, data not shown) and FE properties after 105wake-up field cycling at 2.5 MV/cm. During the wake-up field cycling, a constricted polarization hysteresis becomes more ideal and open due to the redistribution of existing defects such as oxy-gen vacancies.16,17After wake-up field cycling, the HZO sample annealed at 400�C after TiN TE deposition exhibited large 2Pr (48 lC/cm2) and Psw (45 lC/cm2) and low FE Vsat 400�C before TiN TE deposition (2Pr of 6 lC/cm2, Psw of (�1.5 V) compared to those of the HZO sample annealed at 3 lC/cm2, and FE Vsat of �2.0 V). The origin of such a large difference will be discussed in detail later. The HZO sampleannealed at 500�C after TiN TE deposition shows a relatively high FE Vsat (�2.0 V) and leakage current properties while maintaining large 2Pr (52 lC/cm2) and Psw (45 lC/cm2). From these",1002
kim_largepolarization_APL_2017.docx,results,", it was found that the annealing process at 400�C is required to achieve high 2Pr and Psw and should be performed after TiN TE deposition. Moreover, a TiN TE (90 nm or higher) of sufficient thickness is also required to achieve the large 2Pr and Psw as shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(d). Notably, the obtained FE Vsat is maintained at a constant value regardless of the TiN TE thickness and is lower than that (2.5–3.0 V) of previously reported doped-HfO2 films.7,8 The resulting crystal structures of the various HZO films before and after annealing and with varying TiN TE thick-nesses are examined using an X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab) system via grazing-angle incidence XRD (GIXRD) in the 2h range of 26�–40�with an incidence angle of 0.5�as shown in Fig. 2. Before the measurements, the TiN TEs of all HZO samples are removed using SC-1 (NH4OH þ H2O2) after the annealing process. Because of the structural similarity, it is difficult to distinguish the o-phase from the tetragonal phase (t-phase, space group: P42/nmc) in the GIXRD pattern, so that the HZO peaks centered at �30.5�and�35.5�are assigned to the o(1 1 1) phase and o(2 0 0) phase, which coincides with the FE behavior. The HZO (-1 1 1) and (1 1 1) peaks from the m-phase are centered at �28.5�and�31.5�, respectively.9,18The TiN (1 1 1) peaks from the BEs centered at 36.7�(Ref. 19) are also shown in Fig. 2(a).FIG. 2. (a) GIXRD patterns of 10-nm-thick HZO films: as-deposited HZO films and HZO films annealed at 300–500�C before and after TiN TE deposition. The X-ray data for the TiN capped films are taken after chemical removal of the TiN film. (b) Curvature variations of the 100 mm wafers before and after the RTA process and (c) peak position of the o-phase from GIXRD patterns as a function of TiN TE thickness.242901-4Kim et al.Appl. Phys. Lett. 111, 242901 (2017)The lack of the peak definition in both the as-deposited HZO films at room temperature and the HZO films annealed at 300�C is interpreted as having an amorphous or nanocrys-talline structure. The HZO films annealed at 400�C or higher before TiN TE deposition on the other hand reveal the forma-tion of both the o-phase and the m-phase during crystalliza-tion. However, the HZO films annealed at 400�C or higher after TiN TE deposition exhibit o-phase formation with inhi-bition of m-phase formation. Assuming a Gaussian shape of GIXRD peaks from these o- and m-phases, the relative ratio of the area of o(1 1 1)/{m(-1 1 1)þo(1 1 1) þ m(1 1 1)} as a function of annealing temperature is estimated from the deconvoluted GIXRD spectra in the 2h range of 27�–33�. The relative ratio of the o(1 1 1) phase in the HZO film annealed before TiN TE deposition was 54.6% when the annealing temperature was 400�C, and it decreased to 45.3%, 42.0%, and 19.9% for annealing temperatures of 500�C, 600�C, and 700�C, respectively. On the other hand, the relative ratio of the o(1 1 1) phase in the HZO film annealed after TiN TE deposition was 100% when the annealing temperature was 400�C or higher. Figure 2(c) shows the variation in the location of the maximum peak in the 2h range of 27�–33�as a function of TiN TE thickness (i.e., mechanical stress). For the case of a 45-nm-thick TiN TE, the maximum peak position was observed near 30.6�. This means that the HZO film was crystallized with a rela-tively high portion of the HZO (0 1 1) peak from the t-phase, centered at 30.8�,20compared to the tetragonal peak presence in other HZO films used in this work. Interestingly, the ten-dency is entirely consistent with our electrical",1073
kim_largepolarization_APL_2017.docx,results,"as shown in Fig. 1 and Table I. This phenomenon, known as the“capping layer effect,” is related to the mechanical stress from the TiN TE working as a tensile stressor on the HZO film during the annealing process.21–24The mechanical stress is generally divided into two components, namely, an intrin-sic stress due to the film growth process and a thermal stress due to the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the film and its substrate.25By measuring the curvature variations of the 100 mm wafers (Toho FLX 2320-S), the estimated stress becomes larger in accordance with the TiN TE thickness and is induced as tensile stress along the in-plane direction of the HZO film [Fig. 2(b)]. Consequently, the c-axis of the t-phase can be transformed into the a-axis of the o-phase9,20which also agrees with thepresent",207
kim_largepolarization_APL_2017.docx,experiment,"al observation. As the TiN TE thickness increases, the HZO peak shifts toward a lower 2h diffraction angle due to the corresponding change in phase composition [Fig. 2(c)]: the orthorhombic to tetragonal ratio increases.Although the presence of TiN TEs during crystallization of doped-HfO2 films, especially Zr-doped films, has been demonstrated to reduce the m-phase fraction, polycrystalline films consisting of a single o-phase have not been achieved in previous reports.6–9,16–24,26A stable pre-existing m-phase cannot be transformed into the o-phase, and a portion of m-phase can be increased as a result of increasing the HZO film thickness or annealing temperature. Because the m-phase causes the degradation of ferroelectricity, inhibition of m-phase formation during the annealing process is the key to obtaining large FE polarization. Therefore, the overwhelming tensile stress generated by annealing the room-temperature deposited TiN TE is required for the crystallization of a sin-gle, non-centrosymmetric o-phase.Figure 3 shows the cross-sectional high-resolution trans-mission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) images of the 10-nm-thick HZO-based MIM capacitor and HZO samples annealed at 400�C before and after TiN TE deposition. The diffraction spots from o(1 1 1), m(1 1 1), and m(-1 1 1) phases of HZO films are marked in fast Fourier transformation (FFT) images (data not shown). The lattice fringes in both HZO films and the directions of diffraction spots from FFT images suggest that amorphous structures are crystallized. For the case of the 10-nm-thick HZO film annealed at 400�C after TiN TE deposition, the o-phase with a crystallographic orientation along the (1 1 1) plane (a length of about 30 nm in the horizontal direction) was obtained. Using the FFT patterns and its reverse images filtered by a mask, the inter-atomic distance (d) of the enclosed area in both HZO films was measured as shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c).

However, despite these advantages, the HfO2-based FeFETs has shown poor endurance (<106cycles) because of the degradation by charge trapping and defect generation [15]–[17]. Typically, an interlayer (IL) with <1 nm equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) should be used in FeFETs to suppress depolarization field and to maximize voltage drop across FE.As IL is thinner, a higher electric field is applied across IL, which limits the endurance due to IL degradation. Thus, a high-quality IL with <1 nm EOT is required to secure endurance robustness. In this study, to achieve a ∼1 nm thick SiO2 high-quality IL without sacrificing HZO polarization, high-pressure forming gas annealing (HPA) was adopted as the last alloy step. Performance and endurance improvements after the HPA were",789

FABRICATION PROCESSThe FeFETs were fabricated on a 100-nm-thick silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. After the active patterning, the gate stack was fabricated with SiO2 IL, Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO), and TiN. The SiO2 was formed by chemical oxidation using an APM solution (NH4OH:H2O2:H2O = 1:1:5). Next, HZO was deposited using ALD. The deposition cycle consists of 1 cycle of HfO2 followed by 1 cycle of ZrO2. This was repeated 30 times to yield a 6 nm HZO film. Subsequently, 3 nm ALD TiN was deposited and 100 nm TIN was sputtered sequentially on the HZO as a gate metal. Here, the 3 nm ALD TiN plays the role of a blocking layer to prevent the sputtering damage which degrades the HZO and IL (thus, degraded endurance). Gate region was patterned and ion (arsenic) implantation was performed on the exposed source/drain areas with the dose of∼1020and the energy of 15 keV. An RTA at 500◦C for 30 s in N2 ambient was performed as a post-metal annealing (PMA) to activate dopants and to form the orthorhombic phase (O-phase) in HZO. SiO2 was deposited as an interlayer dielectric and the metal contacts of sputtered TiN/Ti/Al were formed. Fig. 1(a) shows the TEM cross-sectional gate stack image where the thicknesses of the SiO2 IL and HZO are confirmed to be 1.2 nm and 5.7 nm, respectively.0741-3106 © 2021 IEEE.

The sense condition (gate voltage was swept from −0.5 V to 1.5 V while drain voltage was kept at 0.1 V) was chosen to sense threshold voltage (VT) but without affecting the polarization of the ferroelectric layer. The width (W) and length (L) of the FeFET under tests are 80 μm and 1 μm. The threshold voltage was extracted at The program voltage (VP) and the erase voltage (VE) were ID = 10−7∗W/L.selected to maximize the memory window (MW) since it is determined by an interplay between charge trapping and ferroelectric switching. With the VP of 3 V, the dependences of VT on the program time (tP) and the drain voltage (VDP) are summarized in Fig. 2(c). The higher VDP",543
Wakeup-Free_and_Endurance-Robust_Ferroelectric_Field-Effect_Transistor_Memory_Using_High_Pressure_Annealing.docx,results,"in a longer program time because the drain-side energy band becomes higher than the source-side by the smaller gate-to-drain volt-age (VGD) and thus VT is determined by the drain-side energy barrier [11].. As a result, it is confirmed that tP < 100 ns can be obtained by VP = 3 V and VDP = 0 V for sufficient programming.. With the VE of −3 V, the dependence of VT on the erase time (tE) and the drain voltage (VDE) was shown in Fig.. 2(d).. It is observed that the faster erasing is achievable with the larger VDE.. This phenomenon can be explained by the combined effects of the larger VGD and gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) on erasing.. For the n-type SOI FeFETs, there are hardly any holes in the body and therefore VE is ineffectual to apply any meaningful voltage across HZO.. However, when high pressure (20 atm) annealing (HPA) was performed at 450◦C for 30 minutes under the forming gas (Ar 96 %, H2 4 %) ambient after the metal contacts formation.. It is clearly observed that the FeFET has the steeper subthreshold swing (SS), higher transconductance (gm), and wider MW after the HPA (Fig.. 3(e)).. To verify the origin of the wider MW, the ferroelectric switching current was directly extracted from the FeFET [19] to evaluate the ferroelectricity (polariza-tion) before/after the HPA through positive-up negative-down (PUND) measurement method by excluding displacement and leakage current components.. The inset of Fig.. 3(d) shows that Pr is enhanced after the HPA because the HPA might help the additional O-phase transition (strongly related to Pr) of the HZO from the tetragonal phase (T-phase).. This hypothesis is supported by the gate current (IG) change in Fig.. 3(d) where the IG is diminished and the clear counter-clockwise hysteretic IG appears after the HPA, which is the strong indicator of both the trap density reduction and the Pr enhancement.. The enhancement of endurance characteristics by the HPA were confirmed under the re-optimized stress condition, VP = 3.5 V, VE = −3.5 V, VDE = 2 V, tP = tE = 100 ns, delay time of 100 ns between VP and VE (Figs.. 4(a) and 4(b))..",553
Wakeup-Free_and_Endurance-Robust_Ferroelectric_Field-Effect_Transistor_Memory_Using_High_Pressure_Annealing.docx,CONCLUSION,"The wakeup-free and endurance-robust FeFETs are demon-strated using high-pressure forming gas annealing. By mon-itoring the changes of the electrical characteristics after the HPA, it is found that HPA contributes significantly to the performance and endurance improvements through trap states reduction, polarization enhancement, and wakeup elimination. After optimizing the biases and timings for program/erase operations, the FeFETs successfully show larger than 1010 endurance cycles. To reveal the endurance limiting factors and to further improve the endurance, the degradation mechanisms were rigorously analyzed by measuring the VT/SS changes of P and E states with respect to the number of cycling. As a result, it is proved that the VT shift and SS degradation mainly result from the injections of the GIDL-induced holes and the holes generated by the hot electrons from the gate into the gate dielectric.Authorized licensed use limited to: Georgia Institute of Technology.

Lett. 102, 242905 (2013)5.5-, 10-, 17-, and 25-nm-thick HZO films were depos-ited on sputtered-TiN/Si substrate using thermal ALD at awafertemperatureof280�CusingHf[N(C2H5)CH3]4,Zr[N(C2H5)CH3]4, and ozone, as the Hf-precursor, Zr-precur-sor, and oxygen source, respectively. Under the given ALD conditions, HZO films with a Hf:Zr ratio of 0.5:0.5 were de-posited using HfO2:ZrO2 ALD cycle ratio of 1:1. For the electrical characterization, Pt (60 nm)/TiN (20 nm) top elec-trodes (TE) were deposited using DC sputtering through a shadow mask with a hole diameter of 300 lm (TiN contacts HZO films). After TE deposition, rapid thermal annealing was performed for 30 s at 400–800�C in a N2 atmosphere. The cation composition and tf were examined using X-ray fluorescence (Quant’X, Thermo SCIENTIFIC) and ellipsom-etry (L-116d, Gaetner), respectively. The evolution of the crystallographic phase of the films according to tf and anneal-ing temperature (Tanneal) was examined by grazing-angle inci-dence X-ray diffraction (GAXRD, Pananalytical X-pert Pro, Cuka radiation with an X-ray wavelength of 0.15405 nm). For electrical characterization, the polarization-voltage (P-V), capacitance-voltage (C-V), and current-voltage characteris-tics (I-V) were measured at room temperature using a ferro-electric tester (TF analyzer 2000, Aixacct systems), an impedance analyzer (4194A, HP), and a semiconductor pa-rameter analyzer (4145B, HP), respectively.Figures 1(a)–1(c) show the detailed GAXRD spectra in the 2h range of 27�-33�for 10-, 17-, and 25-nm-thick HZOfilms, respectively.23Unambiguous identification of the m-,o-, and t-phases in an HfO2-ZrO2 system using a laboratory X-ray system is quite challenging due to the proximity of thediffraction peaks from the different phases. The discrimina-tion of o- and t-phases is especially challenging due to theirstructural similarity. Nevertheless, the diffraction peaks near a 2h of 30.5�are very useful to discern these two phases. Peaks ascribed to the m-phase can be identified quite easily, since there are characteristic peaks near 2h values of 28.5�and 31.6�. For the case of 5.5-nm-thick films, the GAXRD spectra were smeared due to their small tf. The peaks at�28.5�, �30.5�, and �31.6�could be assigned as m(�111), o(111)/t(011), and m(111), respectively. The intensity near 30.5�originates from the overlapped o(111) and t(011) peaks. B€oscke et al. reported that 2h value of t(011) peak is slightly larger than that of o(111) peak for the case of Si-doped HfO2 films.22The GAXRD peaks of the 27.5�–33�region were, therefore, simulated using Gaussian functions with fixed peak locations at 28.54�, 30.40�, 30.80�, and 31.64�for m(-111), o(111), t(011), and m(111), respectively. The assignment of o(111) peak location to 30.40�was based on the lattice parameters of HZO film suggested by Mueller et al.4However, (011) peak position of t-phase HZO cannot be found from literature. The only data that could be foundwere on the (011) positions for t-phase HfO2 (Ref. 14) and t-phase ZrO2 (Ref. 20). Considering that these two phases form a complete solid solution, and have similar structures,FIG. 1.

Lett. 102, 242905 (2013)the Vegard’s law could be used to determine the (011) peak position of t-phase HZO, and the result was 30.8�. For the case of 10-nm-thick films, the as-deposited film is amor-phous. After annealing at 400 and 500�C, a peak at 30.5�can be clearly seen, which indicates that the film first crystal-lizes into a mixture of o- and t-phase. When the film was annealed at 600 and 700�C, a peak at 28.5�appeared, while the intensity of the peak at 30.5�decreased slightly. This means that further crystallization of the amorphous film bythe annealing at higher Tanneal",1478

For the case of 17- and 25-nm-thick films, the as-deposited films show a strong peak at 30.5�and weak peaks at 28.5�and 31.6�, suggesting that the films were already crystallized with a mixture of m- and o/t-phases.. Increasing Tanneal decreases the intensity of the peak at 30.5�, while the intensities of the peaks at 28.5�and 31.6�increase, which suggests that the annealing at higher temperature increases and decreases the portion of m-, and o/t phases, respectively.. In addition, the position of the peak near 30.5�shifted toward the low 2h region with increasing Tanneal for 10- and 17-nm-thick films.. However, such a shift was not observed for the peaks near 28.5�and 31.6�.. Figure 1(d) shows the variations in the location of the maximum point of the peak near 30.5�as a function of Tanneal.. Interestingly, the peak near 30.5�of the 25-nm-thick sample did not show such a change, as shown in Fig.. 1(d).. The diffraction peaks near a 2h of 30.5�were deconvo-luted assuming that the peaks are composed of two components with peak locations at 30.4�(o-phase) and 30.8�(t-phase), with Gaussian shapes.. In addition, the peaks located at 28.54�and 31.64�, both corresponding to the m-phase, are also simulated using the same Gaussian functions to compare the relative area ratio of the peaks.. The variations in the relative ratio of the integrated area of the peaks of each phase to the sum of them are shown in the lower panels of Figs.. 2(b)–2(d) for the 10-, 17-, and 25-nm-thick films, as a function of Tanneal.23Post-deposition annealing can influ-ence the film structure by densification and crystallization.. However, as can be understood from Fig.. 1, the peak posi-tions corresponding to m-phase hardly show any change by the annealing, whereas the peaks near 2h of 30.5�show sub-stantial change depending on the thickness and annealing temperature..",535
CSHwang_HfZrO2_APL_2013.docx,results,"suggest the following.. The non-linear correlation between the 2Pr and relative ratio of o-phase peak intensity reveals that the ferroelectric and non-ferroelectric phases are present with a complicated distribution along the film thickness direction and parallel direction to the film plane.. If they were clearly distinguished from each other and were present in parallel along the film plane, the 2Pr would have to be proportional to the o-phase intensity, which is certainly not the case.. It can be inferred from the generally increasing m-phase por-tion with the increasing tf for almost all Tanneal values that the m-phase grows on top of the t- and o-phases, which must be a reasonable consequence of increasing grain size with increasing tf and lower volumetric free energy of m-phase compared with other phases.. The highest 2Pr of the 10-nm-thick film can be understood from the lower amount of non-ferroelectric m-phase over the o-phase grains.. Meanwhile, the 5.5-nm-thick film may suffer from the deleterious interfa-cial effects with the TiN electrode, such as the dead-layer effect,28which eventually decreases 2Pr compared with 10-nm-thick film.. With a non-ferroelectric phase on top of the ferroelectric phase, the effective electric field applied to the ferroelectric phase is decreased, which is further aggravated as the er of the non-ferroelectric phase decreases.. This can explain the generally decreasing 2Pr with the increasing Tanneal when it is >600�C for the 10- and 17-nm thick films, as the m-phase intensity largely increased in that Tanneal range; a certain por-tion of the t-phase present on top of the o-phase possibly transforms into the m-phase, while the o-phase peak inten-sities are almost invariant.. In contrast, the 2Pr values increase with increasing Tanneal up to 600�C, even though the m-phase peak also increases in that region for the 10-and 17-nm-thick films.. This must be understood from the improvement of the crystalline quality of the o-phase itself with the increasing Tanneal..",462

IMEC_Backend_Ferroelectric_VLSI_2017.docx,Introduction,": Ferroelectric (FE) materials are very promising candidates for memory applications due to their spontaneous polarization, which can be reversed by the application of an electric field. New interests have recently emerged in this area with the discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO2 [1]. The presence of a small amount of dopants, a capping layer and a thermal anneal facilitates the transformation of the monoclinic phase into a non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase, responsible for the ferroelectric behavior. Most of the published papers report on the fabrication of planar capacitor using TiN as metal electrodes [2-4]. Polakowski et al. reported the fabrication of deep trench capacitors based on Al:HfO2 with a 13:1 aspect ratio and TiN as metal electrodes [5]. In this paper, we report for the first time the fabrication of a vertical 3D NAND device with poly-Si gates, ferroelectric Al:HfO2 gate oxide and poly-Si channel. Device Fabrication: Fig. 1 shows the process sequence for the cylindrical vertical channel with three cells in series. In this channel-last process, the Si substrate is firstly implanted to form the source junction and then annealed at 1050 °C for dopant activation. The 50 nm thick doped poly-Si gates are then successively deposited, separated by 30 nm thick SiO2. After dopant activation, vertical cylindrical holes with diameters ranging from 60 to 200 nm are etched. 9.5 nm thick FE-HfO2 is then deposited by atomic layer deposition, followed by a thin a-Si protective layer. The bottom of the hole is then opened and the hole is filled with a-Si, highly doped in this study, which serves as channel and drain after a further As implant. The stack is then annealed at temperatures ranging from 750 °C to 1050 °C for drain activation as well as FE- layer crystallization. Finally, the staircase is formed followed by metal contacts [6]. The schematic view of the vehicle is shown in Fig. 2. The cross-section of the final device can be seen in Fig. 3 with a hole diameter of ~70 nm. The bottom opening with recess in Si substrate can clearly be observed (Fig. 3 (a)) as well as crystallization of the channel (Fig. 3 (b)). To analyze the crystal structure of FE-HfO2 through Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction (GIXRD), a special layout was designed, in which the density of the holes was increased (Fig. 4), to amplify the signal intensity. After HfO2 deposition along the holes, the layer was etched back to leave it only in the sidewall. Thus, only the signal from the vertical HfO2 in the holes was measured through GIXRD. Material and electrical characterizations: GIXRD data can be observed in Fig. 5. A mixture of monoclinic and orthorhombic/cubic phases was detected. Electrical measurements were performed using a 100k holes array. Polarization-Voltage (P-V) measurement after 1000 bipolar cycles at 5 V and a drain anneal of 850 °C is shown in Fig 6. A remnant polarization (2Pr) of 17 μC/cm2 and a coercive voltage (2Vc) of 6 V were extracted. The impact of drain anneal is shown in Fig. 7. High thermal budget seems to degrade the FE-layer, until it loses FE-phase. Endurance was studied by applying successive bipolar pulses (Fig. 8). A drawback of FE-HfO2 is that the coercive voltage is close to the breakdown voltage. The endurance is thus limited by the applied voltage (greater than Vc). Before hard breakdown, the presence of leakage current deforms the P-V hysteresis (Fig. 9). A comparison in term of 2Pr, 2Vc and endurance at 4.5 V is given in Fig. 10. This clearly confirms the degradation of the ferroelectric property with increasing temperature.Retention measurements were carried out at 85 °C and 150 °C at 5 V after 500 cycles, on the sample annealed at 750 °C. The procedure, based on [7], is given in Fig. 11. The imprint phenomenon was studied separately. As can be seen in Fig. 12, an asymmetrical horizontal shift, depending on the baked state, is observed with time, typical for imprint. Extrapolation with time for the larger Vc shift in each case is given in Fig. 13 with the assumption of a Vc limit of 4.5 V, at which all domains can no longer be switched, leading to a loss in 2Pr.

Peide_Ferroelectric_HfO2_sub_ns_IEDM_2019.docx,INTRODUCTION,"resistance. An insulating sapphire substrate is employed to reduce Due to the fast speed [1-7], high retention/endurance [8, 9]and CMOS compatible process, ferroelectric (FE) hafnium oxide (HfO2), such as hafnium zirconium oxide (HZO) [10], has been the promising material for various ferroelectric device applications such as ferroelectric memory (FeRAM), ferroelectric field-effect transistors (Fe-FETs) [1,2,4] and negative-capacitance FETs (NC-FETs) [11-13]. In all these devices, ferroelectric polarization switching speed is a critical factor, which directly determines the working speed of the device. The reported ferroelectric polarization switching times in literatures broadly scatter from few ns to μs [1-7]. Recently, it was studied that the RC time constant in the measurement system can be one of the key problems to under-estimate the intrinsic fast switch speed of ferroelectric hafnium oxide, leading to a broad distribution of polarization switching time [7]. By excluding the impact of RC, 10 ns full polarization switching or few ns characteristics switching time (t0) were achieved [7]. The fast, scalable in dimension and non-volatile properties enable HfO2 based Fe-FET to be a strong energy-efficient candidate for non-volatile memory applications and even for the faster volatile memories [14]. However, to replace volatile memories like dynamic RAM (DRAM) or even static RAM (SRAM), sub-ns or GHz operational speed is required and has not been demonstrated in FE HfO2 system directly. In this work, the transient ferroelectric polarization switching dynamics in HZO is directly measured by an ultrafast pulse measurement setup. A record low characteristic switching time down to 925 ps is achieved for the first time in sub-ns range, extracted by a nucleation limited switching (NLS) model [15]. A W/HZO/W crossbar capacitor structure and fabrication process are developed to scale down the device area to few μm2. RC time constants are carefully measured by both capacitance and resistance measurements directly. It is demonstrated that the capacitor area has a significant impact on polarization switching time not because of the RC time constant but due to the intrinsic area dependence. The intrinsic area dependence is ascribed to the multi-grain polycrystalline nature of the FE HZO thin film. The the parasitic effects and signal reflection. The device fabrication process is described in Fig. 2(a). The starting point is an insulating sapphire substrate. W sputtering followed by CF4/Ar dry etch was used to pattern the bottom W electrodes. Ti/Au contact pads were then defined by photo lithography, e-beam evaporation and a lift-off process. HZO (Hf:Zr=1:1) was deposited by ALD at 200 °C using TDMAHf ([(CH3)2N]4Hf), TDMAZr ([(CH3)2N]4Zr) and H2O as Hf, Zr and O precursors. The top W electrodes were defined by sputtering and a lift-off process. A 500 °C rapid thermal annealing was then performed in N2 for 60 s. Fig. 2(b) and 2(c) shows the cross-sectional schematic of fabricated capacitor and the TEM image on FE HZO. Fig. 3 shows the polarization versus electric field (P-E) hysteresis loop of a crossbar MIM capacitor with 8 nm HZO, showing well-behaved ferroelectric properties. Fig. 4 shows the capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics of a crossbar MIM capacitor with 15 nm HZO, with a typical butterfly-shape ferroelectric hysteresis. Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram of the ultrafast pulse measurement setup. A high speed pulse generator along with high speed and high power amplifier (leading to maximum of ~9 V and 300 ps rise time in this work) and a 80 GS/s oscilloscope were used to generate the voltage pulses and monitor the transient switching current. Impedance matched probes and pick-off tee were used to minimize the signal reflections. A positive-up-negative-down (PUND) pulse sequence was applied to directly measure the polarization switching current [7, 16], as shown in Fig. 6, highlighting the preset pulse, switching pulse and non-switching pulse, as also pointed out in Fig. 3.

The current response to switching pulse 978-1-7281-4032-2/19/$31.00 ©2019 IEEE15.2.1IEDM19-342(Ipulse1) is wider compared to the current response to non-switching pulse (Ipulse2) due to the extra polarization switching current. Fig. 9 plots the transient current Ipulse1, Ipulse2 and IFE in the same time scale. The net polarization switching current IFE is calculated by IFE=Ipulse1-Ipulse2. The transient polarization charge density is calculated by the integration of IFE (P = ∫ IFE dt), as shown in Fig. 10. A nucleation limited switching model was applied for the multi-grain polycrystalline HZO to extract the characteristic switching time constant. In NLS model for a single grain element, the polarization switching dynamics follow the equation as � =����(1 − exp (− ����)), where β is an exponential parameter and t0 is a voltage-dependent characteristic switching time [5,15]. β=2 is used in this work due to 2-dimentional nature of thin film. Sub-ns polarization switching was achieved in 15 nm HZO at 9 V and with a device area of 8.4 μm2, where the extracted characteristic switching time is 925 ps, as shown in Fig. 10. The transient FE switching currents for 15 nm HZO capacitors with different areas (Voltage=9 V, E=0.6 V/nm) are plotted in Fig. 11 and the corresponding transient polarization charge densities are shown in Fig. 12. There is a clear area-dependent switching speed as indicated in Fig. 13. The RC time constants for these devices (as shown in Fig. 7) are about 5 times smaller than the characteristic switching times, suggesting the measured switching speed is not limited by the RC effect. Therefore, the ferroelectric polarization switching has an intrinsic area dependence. It is understood that the polarization switching process in polycrystalline FE thin film is a sequential switching process of each elemental grain, according to the nucleation limited switching model, as shown in Fig. 14. At scaled device size, the grain number is significantly reduced so that the polarization switching speed is improved. Measurements of IFE on 10 nm HZO capacitors under different electric fields are shown in Fig. 15, showing a clear electric field dependence. The corresponding transient polarization charge densities are shown in Fig. 16. Fig. 17 shows the extracted characteristic switching time versus electric field for 10 nm HZO, showing faster polarization switching under higher electric field. Fig. 18 and Fig. 19 show the thickness-dependent transient polarization switching current and transient polarization charge density. The HZO capacitors of each thickness are measured at maximum voltage allowed. The corresponding extracted characteristic time constants versus HZO thickness is shown in Fig. 20, from which the trend of thickness dependence is clear that thicker films are faster.

Later, 100 cycles of Hf0.8Zr0.2O2 is deposited at 250�C using an Ultratech Fiji G2 atomic layer deposition (ALD) tool, providing a 10nm-a)Electronic mail: sayeef@berkeley.edu.thick amorphous HZO film. A 4:1 ratio between the HfO2 mono-layer and the ZrO2 mono-layer determines the stoichiom-etry of the deposited HZO. Next, 10 nm of W or TiN is depos-ited on the stack followed by a 30s-RTA step in N2 at 500�C to crystallize the HZO. Finally, a stack of Ti/TiN/Al is sput-tered on the sample, 60nm each, and the top electrodes are defined by subsequent photolithography and reactive ion etch-ing. For MIM capacitors with W or TiN electrodes, the Si sub-strate is first coated with 100 nm of the chosen electrode (W or TiN) followed by deposition of 10nm HZO and 100nm of the same electrode. Next, the stack is annealed under similar condi-tions mentioned above (500�C and 30s), and top electrodes are further defined by lithography and etching. Two methods for TiN deposition have been investigated: DC sputtering at room temperature and ALD at 400�C. In contrast, only DC sputter-ing has been used for deposition of W films reported here.The PV and PUND measurements described here are performed using a Radiant Precision Multiferroic analyzer. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the PUND and PV measurements on MIS structures. The highest (23 lC/cm2) and lowest (5 lC/cm2) remanent polarization (Pr) values in HZO films are observed with W and ALD TiN capping, respectively. The lower Pr for ALD TiN capping (5lC/cm2) compared to sput-tered TiN (12 lC/cm2) is most likely due to prolonged expo-sure (�1 h) of HZO to a temperature of 400�C at which atomic layer deposition of TiN takes place. This temperature is sufficient to initiate the crystallization of the HZO, and par-ticularly during the sample loading and initial cycles of TiN deposition can modify the stabilized phases in the film.21 Crystallization of the HZO film with no capping is expected to result in the stabilization of a non-polar monoclinic phase, and therefore, ALD TiN-capped HZO is expected to be less ferroelectric than the sputtered TiN-capped film.1,21 The DC current measurement on MIS capacitors, Fig. S1 in the supplementary material, shows comparable leakage current for different electrodes.0003-6951/2017/111(2)/022907/4/$30.00111, 022907-1Published by AIP Publishing.022907-2Karbasian et al.Appl.

Dunkel et al. [2] have reported that the Vth variation of the two polarization states, high-Vth and low-Vth states, are overlapping for industrial scaled FeFETs. The stabilization of the ferroelectric properties in HfO2 filmwas examined through the doping with various elements, such as Si-doping etc. [3], and the controlling of grain growth for the ferroelectric polycrystalline film [4]. Recently, some of the authors have reported that the embedding Al nanoclusters in ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) film tends to adjust the crystal orientation of orthorhombic grains to [001] and the memory characteristics of the HZO based FeFET with the embedded Al nanoclusters is demonstrated [5,6]. In this paper, we revealed by device simulation that fluctuation of polarization orientation induces the large Vth variation for low-Vth state, and demonstrated that the embedding Al nanoclusters in the HZO based FeFET memory suppress the Vth variation after the polarization hysteresis loop measured. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Si-monolayer insertion intothe HZO film with Al nanoclusters suppressed the Vth variation after the erase pulse applied. The transient behavior of the polarization in the FeFET memory is discussed and compared with the classical switching models of the ferroelectric film [7,8].

A HZO film (Hf:Zr = 1:1) with hafnium tetrachloride (HfCl4/H2O) and zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl4/H2O) precursors was deposited on the IL by atomic layer deposition at 300 ºC. Al nanoclusters and Si monolayerwere inserted into the HZO film. Al nanoclusters were doped with physical vapor deposition at room temperature. The dose of Al is 5 × 1013 cm-2.

Vth variation for the two polarization states in FeFET Fig. 3 shows the forward and reverse Id-Vg characteristics in the non-doped FeFET. The counterclockwise hysteresis loop shows the ferroelectric behavior. Fig. 4 shows the gate area dependence of the memory window (MW), the difference between high-Vth and low-Vth states, in the non-doped FeFET. MW is confirmed even in the small gate area devices. However, Vth and MW variation are serious issue in the scaled FeFET as shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Relative Vth after Vg sweep and MW are defined as the difference from the median values. The Vth variation of low-Vth state is larger than that of high-Vth state and strongly correlated to the MW variation.Fig. 7 shows 978-1-7281-4032-2/19/$31.00 ©2019 IEEE15.4.1IEDM19-350Vth variation (σVth) divided by electrical equivalent gate dielectric oxide thickness (EOT) for the non-doped FeFET and bulk NMOSFET [9]. Vth variation of the non-doped FeFET regardless of high-Vth and low-Vth states is larger than that of NMOSFET. Vth variation of NMOSFET is mainly attributed to the random dopant fluctuation.According to the classical switching models of the ferroelectric film, the switching behavior for the actual FeFET memory is also influenced by the non-uniformity of the polarization orientation and domain growth rate as shown in Fig. 8. Therefore, Vth variation of the FeFET memory is attributed to the fluctuation of polarization orientation and domain growth rate in the ferroelectric film. The non-uniformity of the polarization orientation and domain growth rate affects Vth variation even after the completely reversal of each domains and the switching speed variation in FeFET, respectively. We performed device simulation to verify the hypothesis that the fluctuation of polarization orientation induces the large Vth variation for low-Vth state in FeFET. The ferroelectric film is divided into four domains, and one domain is replaced as a paraelectric region to evaluate the spatial fluctuation of polarization. Fig. 9 shows the calculated Id-Vg characteristics of FeFET at high-Vth and low-Vth states. The low-Vth state is more susceptible to the polarization orientation fluctuation than the high-Vth state. Moreover, the fluctuation at the source side in FeFET has the largest influence of the Vth variation. Fig. 10 shows the calculated electrostatic potential along dielectric/Si substrate interface with the polarization orientation fluctuation on the source side of FeFET. It is suggested that the potential fluctuation on the substrate due to the non-uniformity of the polarization orientation causes Vthvariation to be superimposed. The effect is more evident for the low-Vth state because the potential on the substrate of the low-Vth state is lower than that of no polarization state. B. The analysis of the polarization orientation fluctuation Fig. 11 shows the cumulative frequency distribution of relative Vth after Vg sweepof FeFET with Al. Vth variation of low-Vth state is almost the same as that of high-Vth state, which shows the merit of Al nanoclusters to reduce Vth variation at low-Vth state as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 12 shows the cumulative frequency distribution of relative Vth after the erase pulse applied during 1 μs in the three types of FeFET memory arrays. It is found that the suppression of Vth variation for the FeFET with Al+Si is more than 25 % enhanced as compared to that for the FeFET with Al in even short channel region as shown Fig. 13.

The complete polarization reversal (ΔVth max) is defined as MW after 1 ms. The domain reverse probability, which is MW (t) /ΔVth max, as function of pulse time (t) is plotted in Fig. 18.

V C 2011 American Institute of Physics.[doi:10.1063/1.3636434]Electronic devices based on ferroelectric (FE) thin films have enjoyed the attention of the research community for decades.1A number of device concepts based on a direct fer-roelectric/silicon junction have been proposed.2,3However, most of the well behaved ferroelectrics, such as strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT) and lead zirconium titanate (PZT) constitute elements that easily react with silicon and silicon oxide during high temperature steps and are, therefore, not suited for device applications where the ferroelectric thin film is in direct contact with silicon. Therefore, the practical realization has been limited to devices with thick interlayers between ferroelectric and silicon and reduced thermal budget to avoid degradation of the interface.Recently, we reported the discovery of a FE crystalline phase in silicon doped hafnium oxide.4Hafnium oxide is one of only few metal oxides which are both thermodynamically stable on silicon and SiO2 and offer a sufficient band gap to function5as a low leakage dielectric insulator. It is, there-fore, ideally suited for electronic devices which require direct ferroelectric/silicon junctions.Thin films of HfO2 crystallize in a mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic grains.6The fraction of the tetragonal phase can be controlled by doping with silicon,7,8zirconium,9rare earth elements,10and other metal oxides. If HfO2 based thin films, at a composition where the tetragonal phase is not yet stable, are crystallized in presence of a cap, the formation of a FE orthorhombic phase is observed.4For slightly higher levels of doping, antiferroelectric (AFE) polarization loopsSi:HfO2 was deposited by a metal organic atomic layer deposition process based on Tetrakis-(ethylmethylamino)-haf-nium (TEMA-Hf), Tetrakis-dimethylamino-silane (4DMAS), metalorganic precursors, and ozone. The silicon content was defined by varying the cycle ratio of the precursors and moni-tored by secondary ion mass spectrometry and elastic recoil detection analysis on samples without thermal treatment. The crystallization temperature of all films in the used thickness (7-12 nm) and composition range (2.5-6 mol. % SiO2) was above 500�C. Titanium nitride electrodes were deposited by a chemical vapor deposition process based on TiCl4 and NH3. Crystallization of the Si:HfO2 thin films was induced by a 1000�C/20 s anneal after (“cap”) or before (“no cap”) top electrode deposition. All measurements were performed on metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors with TiN top and bot-tom electrodes and on blanket wafers for physical measure-ments. Grazing-incidence x-ray diffractograms (GI-XRDs) of Si:HfO2 thin films were measured on a Brucker D8 Discover equipped with a Goebel mirror using Cu-Ka radiation. The temperature dependent measurements were performed at a heating rate of 3 K/min in a N2 atmosphere. Polarization hys-tereses were characterized using an aixACCT TF Analyzer 2000 system at a frequency of 1000 Hz. To investigate the influence of polarization changes with respect to sample tem-perature, the samples were heated and cooled in a range between �60�C and 180�C. To improve the sensitivity of the XRD-measurements, wet chemical etching was used to remove the TiN cap ofwere found. films that were crystallized in presence of a cap.

The spectrum of the 3.8 mol. % SiO2 film showed clear evidence for the formation of the orthorhombic Pbc21 phase (o), which was previously connected to the occurrence of the ferroelectricity.4This is most evident from the observation of (022)/(220) reflex splitting in the absence of (111) splitting, which indicates the formation of an or-thogonal phase with large c/a ratio and similar a and b dimensions.

The scans confirmed the presence of all dominant diffraction peaks. A strong prefer-ential orientation can, therefore, be ruled out within the lim-its of the GI-XRD technique.To further understand the relation between the FE and the AFE behavior, we performed temperature dependent polarization measurements. As shown in Fig. 3(a), a fully re-versible transition from FE to AFE polarization loops is observed at increased temperature. Increasing the silicon content leads to an offset in the temperature dependence, as evident from the relation between polarization and tempera-ture for different compositions (Fig. 3(b)). Both observations imply a temperature dependent phase transformation fromFIG. 2. (Color online) XRD measurements of capped and uncapped Si:HfO2 samples with compositions that exhibited ferroelectric (3.8 mol. %) and anti-ferroelectric (4.3 mol. %) polarization loops.These findings were corroborated by temperature de-pendent XRD measurements on films having the same com-position (Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)). A reduction of the (022)/(220) splitting is found for increasing temperature, suggesting a transition into the t-phase, similar to the effect of increased SiO2 content. Interestingly, the (022)/(220) split was not restored upon cooling down. Instead, the emergence of monoclinic reflexes has been observed. This implies the for-mation of a m/t phase mixture as found for uncapped films. In contrast to MIM capacitors, where the film was capped during the temperature cycle, the cap was removed prior to the XRD measurement. Removal of the cap alone did not lead to the disappearance of the o-phase. This indicates the existence of an energy barrier between the o- and the m-phase, which prevents a direct transition. Mechanical con-finement (“capping”) is necessary during the formation of the metastable o-phase and not a requirement for the pres-ence of this phase. Since a temperature cycle through the t phase induced formation of the m phase, it can be concluded that both phases emerge by transformation from the t phase.This",1107

If the AFE phase was mechanically confined during cooling, it reversi-bly transformed back into the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase. Without confinement, a monoclinic/tetragonal phase mixture was formed. We conclude that there is a common higher symmetry parent phase to both the orthorhombic FE and the monoclinic phase.

The AFE polarization loops may potentially emerge due to a field driven transformation to the ortho-rhombic FE phase. However, as pointed out by Kisi and Howard,15no direct phase relationship between the t and the o phases exists and the transformation takes place via an in-termediate phase, speculated to be of space group Pbcm. This suggests the microscopic origin of the AFE behavior to be rather complex.

Suman_Samsung_FeMFET_IEDM_2018.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are ubiquitously applied in tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing and self-driving cars (Fig.1(a)). Various neuromorphic accelerators based on the cross-bar architecture with nonvolatile weight cells have been investigated (Fig.1(b)). Neuromorphic accelerator performance is improved via elimination of data movement between the processing unit and off-chip memory by storing the synaptic values locally (on-chip) in the weight cells and performing the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation in the analog domain. The performance metrics of the on-chip weight cells vary depending on whether an in-situ training is supported or not. To support in-situ training, a weight with high bit precision is necessary to handle the incremental weight update during training, and complex peripheral circuitry is required to implement back-propagation. However, for inference only applications, low precision weight cell can achieve near-analog levels of accuracy. Therefore, by relegating the training to the cloud domain, we focus on a logic compatible embedded weight cell capable of excellent inference performance targeting edge devices [1]. The dynamics of multi-domain ferroelectric polarization switching in FeFET can be utilized for an analog weight cell [2]. However, all reported FeFETs suffer from high write voltages (±4.0 V) and limited endurance of ~105 cycles (Fig.2) [3]. This is because of the non-uniform field distribution across the gate stack, with the majority of the voltage drop across the interlayer (IL) and the semiconductor channel [4]. This increases the write voltage and degrades the reliability due to enhanced charge trapping in the FE [4]. This inefficiency can be overcome by integrating the FE capacitor in the back-end, electrically coupled to the gate of a conventional MOSFET (Fig.1(d)), rather than direct integration within the MOS gate stack. By independently optimizing the AFE/AMOS (AR: area ratio between MFM and MOSFET) of the metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) capacitor and the MOSFET, the voltage drop across the FE can be maximized, which in turn reduces the write voltage, eliminates charge trapping and improves endurance(Fig.2).

II.DEVICE FABRICATION PROCESS The key fabrication steps are shown in Fig.3(a). Boron doped (3x1017 cm-3) p-type silicon wafers are used to achieve enhancement mode MOSFET operation. After alignment mark etch, source/drain ion implantation and junction activation follow. SiO2 chemical oxide passivation and thermal ALD of 10nm thick HfO2 with 50nm thick tungsten (W) metal electrode completes the gate stack. CVD SiO2 is deposited for MFM capacitor isolation and a W via process is used to connect to the MOSFET gate. W bottom electrode, 10nm thick PEALD Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 deposited at 300°C and W top electrode forms the MFM stack before 600°C FE crystallization anneal. CVD SiO2 is used for MFM isolation. The FeMFET device fabrication is completed by via etch for connection to W top electrode and source/drain and Ti/Al contact metallization and anneal to form low-resistivity Ti-Silicide contacts. Top and tilted view SEM images (Fig.3(b)) show the top MFM electrode and the internal gate, which are used to probe the C-V, I-V characteristics of the MFM and MOSFET individually. A zoomed-in view shows the W via that connects the MFM cap to the underlying MOSFET gate. Cross-section TEM images (Fig.3(c)) of FeMFET clearly show the connections between the MFM and MOSFET gate, highlighting the monolithic integration of the MFM with the MOSFET. The HRTEM images reveal poly-crystalline nature of the FE HZO in the MFM. III.",447
Suman_Samsung_FeMFET_IEDM_2018.docx,DISCUSSION,"A.FeMFET Operation: Program, Erase and Read The fundamental device operating principle is first demonstrated by electrically coupling a discrete MFM cap to the gate of a MOSFET (Fig.4(a)). The QFE-VFE characteristics of MFM cap show the transition from saturated to non-saturated hysteresis loops as the VFE sweep range decreases (Fig.4(b)). When connected with a MOSFET, the DC ID-VG characteristics exhibit large hysteresis window (~ 2.0V) for a VG sweep voltage of -1.8V to 1.8V. The lowering of VG sweep range reduces the current ratio between the two FE polarization states, which corresponds to minor loop operation of the ferroelectric. To quantitatively understand the program/erase operation of the FeMFET, a model is developed by introducing the AR design parameter to the Preisach FeFET model [5]. Fig.5(a) shows the bias conditions to operate the FeMFET weight cell. The select transistor eliminates the disturb to half-select cells and pass the write voltage to the FeMFET gate. Fig.5(b) shows the waveform for the cell write and read operations. After erase, the internal gate voltage, VMOS, remains high, whereas it becomes low after program. VMOS after program/erase corresponds to the two intersection points between the MOSFET loadline and the FE subloop during program/erase cycle (Fig.6(a)). Their separation determines the current ratio between the two states and the available cell read window. By decreasing the AR, the MFM capacitance is reduced and the voltage across it is increased (Fig.6(b)). This mitigates the undesirable voltage division issue encountered in FeFET and reduces the write voltage from 4.0V to 1.8V. However, too small of an AR decreases the total polarization charge (Fig.6(c)), which in turn decreases the read window, leading to an optimal approximately a linear behavior (Fig.11(b)), critical for neuromorphic inference application. Higher VDS and shorter channel length can further enhance the FeMFET conductance values and accelerate the read speed. The deviation of the FeMFET channel conductance values or weights from ideal linearity and its impact on inference accuracy is illustrated in Fig.12(a). A nonlinear fit is performed on the measured weights and used for hardware aware quantization. Fig.12(b) shows the inference error incurred for the MNIST digit recognition task compared with a floating point weight, resulting from the weight quantization effect (1-bit, 2-bits, and 4-bits). It is clear that 2bits/cell is suffice to achieve analog-level accuracy, albeit with increase in number of the hidden layer neurons. Fig.13(a) shows the FeMFET array architecture for AR range maximizing memory window (Fig.6(d)). inference. The pseudo-crossbar architecture performs the MAC Furthermore, unlike other nonvolatile memories such as STT-MRAM or RRAM, FeMFET can be operated as a multi-port device due to the separation of read and write path. B. Integrated FeMFET Device The integrated FeMFET device characteristics are shown in Fig.7. The MFM capacitor CFE-VFE curve exhibits double peaks, indicating ferroelectric polarization switching. The MOSFET characteristics are shown in Fig.7(b). The CMOS-VMOS measurements indicate that the capacitance ratio CFE/CMOS is 1/8, which increases the voltage drop across the MFM cap, as shown in Fig.6. The FeMFET ID-VG characteristics are similar to the discrete MFM and MOSFET measurement. It exhibits ~1.5V hysteresis window for VG range of -1.8V to 1.8V. Fig.8 shows measured program/erase/read operation waveform of FeMFET with logic compatible write voltages. The thick gate oxideand small voltage drop (due to small AR) in the MOSFET, ensures that there is no charge trapping in the FE or the internal floating node, thereby markedly enhancing the FeMFET endurance[4]. Fig.9(a) shows that the FeMFET endurance exceeding 1010 cycles without degradation. Fig.9(b) shows the read current, ID, corresponding to the programmed/erased state as a function of write pulse width for write voltages of 2V, 1.8V, and 1.5V. FeMFET achieves fast write operation (of 100ns for a program/erase voltage of 1.8V, while maintaining read current ratio of >10). The retention state of FeMFET is shown in Fig.10. During retention after erase, the internal node voltage VMOS is approximately the MOSFET VTH to have enough sensed current. This would result in voltage drop of –VTH across the MFM cap, which acts as depolarization field, decreasing the FE polarization(Fig.10(a)). Fig.10(b) shows the measured polarization retention under externally applied depolarization field. It suggests that, in order to reduce the polarization loss, it is necessary to design the underlying MOSFET VTH close to 0V. C.FeMFET Multi-Bit Weight Cell In this section, we demonstrate multi-bit programming of the weight cell using partial polarization switching in the MFM cap[2]. Fig.11(a) shows a well-tempered distribution of the cycle-to-cycle variation for the four distinct ID levels (2 bits/cell) for FeMFET. By tuning the erase voltage amplitude, four ID levels are achieved. The ID-VDS measurement after write indicates that the programmed conductance values follow operation in the analog domain. Two FeMFETs are used to represent positive and negative weights, respectively, which can be achieved by current subtractor (e.g. current mirror). The inference accuracy of the FeMFET array matches that of the floating point weight. These",1340

During the source/drain implant activation step, a fl ash anneal processing step at 1000 °C was applied. Besides the implant activation, the above-mentioned annealing step is conveniently used to crystallize the doped hafnia and to induce the ferroelectric phase. After the suc-cessful scaling to the state-of-the-art 28 nm high-k technology node [ 12,13 ] and device integration, [ 9,10 ] detailed studies of phys-ical mechanisms occurring within doped hafnium layers are needed. In general, memory devices require two or more dis-tinct states (binary 0 and 1 in case of the simplest two-level memory). The stability of these states has to be preserved for a certain number of cycles and after the required retention period depending on the application. [ 14 ] In case of the ferroelec-tric HfO 2 , a high-fi eld bipolar stress cycling impacts the mate-rial properties. The remnant polarization (i.e., Pr value) evolves with cycling showing two distinct trends (see Figure1 a): (i) “Wake-up”: the remnant polarization memory window, re-lates as the difference between positive and negative rem-nant polarization, increases with cycling.

With this in mind, Sec-tion 3 is devoted to investigation of the physical mechanisms behind the wake-up and the fatigue stage. Furthermore, a comprehensive modeling approach framework is developed and introduced to explain the electrical data in terms of phys-ical mechanisms responsible for the wake-up and the fatigue within the ferroelectric capacitor. 2. Phenomenological Analysis Pristine doped HfO 2 samples are usually characterized by double peaks in the current voltage characteristic and conse-quently, a pinched hysteresis loop. It is reported that pristine double peak behavior may originate from different built-in fi elds within the device stack. [ 20 ] Different built-in biases or a different fi eld manifestation on different grains and even portions of the stack can occur due to a nonuniform defect distribution, polycrystallinity of the annealed fi lm and k-value nonuniformity.

[ 17 ] Wake-up and fatigue behaviors are due to a complex inter-play among phenomena involving the ferroelectric properties (e.g., domain orientation, phase stability and fi eld induced phase transitions) and dielectric characteristics (e.g., defect activation/creation, charge injection and consequent trapping), that could induce a built-in bias. [ 18,19 ] Even though those studies offered valuable fi rst step insight into the behavior of these new materials, they were confi ned only to potential mechanisms separately and in a speculative manner. Therefore, a detailed study of the physical mechanisms responsible for the wake-up and fatigue phase in doped hafnium fi lms is strongly required. To this aim, we will show in the present work a comprehensive collection of",620

To address these fundamental challenges, initially, a detailed built-in bias screening evolution with fi eld cycling is presented in Section 2 . This is necessary to get an idea, of how charged defects and ferroelectric properties are distributed within the tion and assessment of the mechanisms of the wake-up and fatigued stages will be presented. 2.1. Built-In bias Screening The difference between positive and negative remnant polariza-tion, Pr+ / Pr− , is related to the memory window (MW). The MW evolution during cycling measured on Sr:HfO 2 -based capaci-tors is shown in Figure 1 . These types of plots are referred to as endurance plot with the word “endurance” being used to describe the ability of a material to withstand a certain number of switching cycles. The initial increase in the MW observed up to 10 3 cycles correlates with the “wake-up” effect as reported elsewhere. [ 15,16,20 ] With further fi eld cycling, the continuous switching of the polarization state reduces the MW. Besides the polarization–voltage ( P – V ) characteristics meas-ured during the endurance test, the current–voltage ( I – V ) char-acteristics were examined. Figure 1 b represents the I – V curves measured on the ferroelectric capacitor at the three stages of the lifetime: (ii) pristine; (iii) woken-up; (iv) fatigue stage. The I – V characteristic measured on the pristine sample is charac-terized by two distinct current peaks, which move toward each other with continuous bipolar cycling, eventually merging in the wake-up regime. Since the polarization-voltage character-istic is the integral of the transient current, this behavior rep-resents a transition of the initially pinched hysteresis loop to a so-called open hysteresis.

In parallel to the endurance behavior, the evolution of the static DC leakage current with the bipolar cycling was moni-tored (Figure 1 c). Leakage current spectroscopy represents a very powerful technique to examine the quality of a dielectric in terms of defects generated/activated within the dielectric layer during the bipolar cycling stress. Interestingly, leakage current remains constant up to 10 3 cycles, which corresponds to the 4602wileyonlinelibrary.com© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAdv. Funct.Mater.2016, 26, 4601–4612www.MaterialsViews.comwake-up stage. Further cycling resulted in signifi cant increase of the leakage current, accompanied by the reduction of the memory window as shown in Figure 1 a. The observed behavior indicates that new defects are generated within the dielectric stack during cycling resulting in an increased leakage current. On the other hand, the constant behavior of the leakage current in the fi rst 10 3 cycles suggests that in the wake-up phase, there is almost no generation of new defects assisting the charge transport through the trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) but a redis-tribution of the existing ones, as well as a change of their occu-pancy. Thus, the endurance trend in the wake-up phase seems to originate from changes in the ferroelectric properties of the Sr:HfO 2 layer. Nevertheless, defect creation/activation/diffu-www.afm-journal.destack becomes more uniform. The change of the built-in bias could be related to the distribution changes of atomic defects within the stack, which can either trap charge thus changing their charge states and the internal fi eld (e.g., oxygen vacan-cies [ 21 ] ) as well as local changes of the material either by phase transformation or vacancy movement under the infl uence of fi eld and temperature. With further cycling, the onset of the fatigue behavior is observed as the progressing decrease in Pr . To gain insight into the fatigue phase, measurements were performed in sim-ilar manner as for the woken-up case. That is, after the device was stressed with alternating switching pulses for 10 6 cycles FORC measurements were recorded. The pseudo-color plots in sion and charge trapping occurring within the dielectric layer Figure 2 b,c (wake-up and fatigue case) show that the maximum cannot be in principle excluded and, thus, requires an in-depth analysis. To deepen this study and access this behavior from the perspective of the resulting internal fi eld, the fi rst-order reversal curve (FORC) technique was employed. As reported by Schenk et al., [ 19 ] the FORC approach repre-sents a very powerful tool for the analysis of the evolution of the switching and back-switching fi eld distributions in doped HfO 2 -based ferroelectrics. This approach originates from the characterization of ferromagnetic materials [ 22 ] and has also been utilized for the characterization of the classic ferroelectric materials in the past decades. The FORC measurement proce-dure starts at a fi elds high enough to reach the saturation polar-ization, here the positive one. Subsequently, the fi eld is swept toward the negative direction and back to saturation, stepwise lowering the value of the reversal fi eld until the opposite (here the negative) saturation polarization is reached. A detailed [ 23,24 ] and simplifi ed mathematical treatment of the measured data as well as a coordinate transform to Ec and Ebias was described in Supporting Information S1. In contrast to the other studies, here the FORC technique is utilized to analyze the evolution of the build-in bias fi eld and coercive fi eld evolution with fi eld cycling of the device. As for the I – V characterization, the focus will be on pristine, wake up and fatigued phases, as shown in Figure 1 a. Utilizing the coordinate transformation (see Sup-porting Information S1) the Preisach density ρ is plotted as function of bias fi eld Ebias and coercive fi eld Ec in Figure2 . As shown in the Figure 2 a, the pristine sample is character-ized by two distinct regions in the Preisach/switching density plot, with two opposite bias fi elds and almost same coercive fi eld. The obtained",984

As shown before, [ 19 ] with fi eld cycling, the bias of these regions disappears resulting in maxima movement toward each other. The maxima fi nally end up merged around zero bias as depicted in Figure 2 b, following the trend of the current peaks in the I – V characteristics in Figure 1 b. Device cycling proves the initial existence of the internal bias fi elds and their disap-pearance with further cycling. Moreover, the current peak merging fully corresponds to an increase of the magnitude of the merging peaks, as well as to an increase in the remnant polarization observed in dynamic hysteresis measurements. This increase of the polarization indicates the increase of the number of domains participating in the switching process, whereas the disappearance of the built-in bias fi eld suggests that the fi eld distribution within the Preisach density decreases, and it is accompanied by slight biasing of the sample toward negative fi elds, which indicates an increasing asymmetry in the TiN/Sr:HfO 2 /TiN device stack. It is expected that due to the dielectric degradation (which pri-marily corresponds to the O vacancy generation [ 25,26 ] ) and con-sequent charge trapping, the ferroelectric layer experiences a lower effective fi eld. This reduces the number of switchable domains which",293

This strong temperature dependence of the wake-up indicates that indeed diffusion/drift process as well as the defect generation can be the responsible mechanism. However, the leakage current during the wake-up stage stays constant indicating that there are no new defects generated (see Figure 1 c). In addition, conditioning",103

The strong temperature acceleration of the wake-up phase suggests adopting higher temperatures to precondition the memory device cells to achieve more stable and uniform device performances. The cells were subjected to just two cycles at elevated temperatures after which the endurance test, i.e., stress and P-E measurement at room temperature were per-formed. With increasing conditioning temperature, the number of the wake-up cycles reduces signifi cantly and completely dis-appears at 150 °C as shown in Figure 2 e. In order to investigate the dielectric properties during the wake-up stage, the evolution of the DC leakage current curve with fi eld cycling was monitored (Figure 1 a). The leakage current remains constant during the wake-up phase (also at elevated temperatures), thus indicating that no new defects are created/activated in the bulk of the dielectric layer, which are those mostly contributing to the TAT leakage current. This means that a generation of new O vacancy defects is not responsible for the wake-up regime observed in the ferroelec-tric capacitor. A partial phase transformation and structural changes, however, are observed in high-angle annular dark-fi eld (HAADF) STEM, the full details of which will be included in a forthcoming publication.

The structure of this sample is expected to be similar to the electrically tested Sr:HfO 2 . Gd-doped HfO 2 fi lms show analog electrical behavior to the Sr:HfO 2 samples investigated in this work as already reported by Hofmann et al. [ 28 ] A more detailed comparison is presented in the Supporting Informa-tion S2. Monoclinic (paraelectric, PE) and orthorhombic (fer-roelectric, FE) grains were observed in the samples, with decreasing monoclinic presence and increasing orthorhombic presence for samples subjected to greater amounts of fi eld-cycling. Bulk grains adjacent to the electrode interfaces had a tendency to relax toward distorted tetragonal phase symmetry within the last few unit cells of HfO 2 next to the interfaces. Relaxation at the electrodes toward tetragonal symmetry was observed in samples from all three cycling conditions, though it was most pronounced in the pristine and least pronounced in the fatigued samples. Figure 2 f) shows STEM images of the HfO 2 /electrode interfaces for each cycling condition. The pristine sample exhibits the greatest tendency to relax toward tetragonal symmetry. The wake-up image shows some relaxa-tion toward the interface, but it seems to retain the phase of the bulk grain more than the pristine. The fatigued sample shows little to no relaxation at the interface. Beside the change in the ferroelectric response, observed phase changes should have signifi cant impact on the dielectric constant of the com-plete stack. Therefore, small-signal capacitance measurements 4604wileyonlinelibrary.com© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAdv.

This is accompanied by an increase of the leakage current indicating a degradation of the stack, continuation of the phase transition and further drop of the total capacitance and k-value as well. 2.2. Mechanisms Mechanisms responsible for the wake-up and fatigue of the conventional ferroelectric materials were investigated in detail during the past 50 years. A huge number of publications pro-posed numerous scenarios dealing with increase and decrease of the polarization in perovskite-based materials. Wake-up studies on PZT material system were performed and reported before. [ 15,29,30 ] On the other hand, a very detailed and system-atic review of fatigue mechanisms was reported by Tagantsev et al. in 2001 [ 17 ] and Lou et al. in 2009. [ 31 ] These studies sug-gested that a combination of several mechanisms (domain de-/ pinning, [ 32 ] seed inhibition, [ 33 ] and formation of the passive/ dead layer [ 34 ] ) could be responsible for the device wake-up and fatigue. Even though these studies proposed a detailed discus-Figure 3. a) Evolution of the ferroelectric remnant polarization compared to leakage current during bipolar cycling measured on Sr:HfO 2 -based fer-roelectric capacitors; b) extracted defect concentration and bias fi eld evo-lution as well as c) capacitance cycling behavior.were performed as function of the external bias voltage ( C – V ). As for other",1356
Pesic_Miko_Cycling_modeling_AFM_2016.docx,experiment,"s, capacitance evolution was also recorded during the fi eld cycling. Typical ferroelectric C – V curves are characterized by butterfl y hystereses with maxima that occur due to the contribution of domain wall capacitance around the coercive fi eld (during the polarization switching). The dielectric constant of complete stack (interfaces and bulk) was extracted from the most saturated region of the character-istics where contributions of the domain wall capacitance are minimal. Independently from the cycling stage, continuous total capacitance/k-value drop of 5% was observed (see Sup-porting Information S3 and Figure3 c). This behavior indicates that the T→O phase transformation (decrease of the k-value) in the interfacial region has a stronger impact on the total k-value than the M→O transformation (increase of the k-value) that occurs within the bulk. A detailed electrical model consisting of three serial capacitors for the two interfaces CIF and the fer-roelectric bulk Cbulk of the stack is given within the Supporting Information S3. Besides the continuous drop of the k-value, in Figure 3 c can be seen that the amount of the charge within the system (ratio of the peak value- Cmax and saturated capac-itance- Cmin ) completely match with evolution of the remnant polarization. Combining all electrical",289
Pesic_Miko_Cycling_modeling_AFM_2016.docx,results,", some trends during the fi eld cycling can be isolated (Figure 3 ): Initially, during the wake-up stage: the polarization response increases, bias fi elds diminish whereas the leakage current stays constant. From the structural perspective, the stressed capacitor undergoes a phase transfor-mation of M→O and T→O in the bulk and interfaces, respec-tively. Both, the increase of the polarization response and the phase transition are accompanied by an increase of the total switching charge within the material system and continuous drop of the capacitance/k-value. With further fi eld cycling, the sion of the mechanisms, most of the literature only discusses phenomenological scenarios. In order to properly assess the complex physical inter-play governing the wake-up and degradation mechanisms in Figure4 , we show a sketch of potential interactions among mechanisms affecting either dielectric (i.e., defect—O vacancy and O ion—creation, diffusion, recombination) and ferro-electric (change of the remnant polarization by, e.g., domain wall pinning, seed inhibition and other modifi cations of the switching process) properties. These mechanisms are con-nected to each other and take place at both interfacial and in bulk regions. Therefore, they cannot be perfectly separated in reality. For instance: the ferroelectric switching degradation might be connected to defect, i.e., O vacancy creation and sub-sequent charge trapping. The defect creation depends on the fi eld, and increases with increasing fi eld due to the switching and ion displacement of the ferroelectric material during cycling. [ 35 ] As it can be seen from Figure 3 , the relation of the mechanisms within the stack is of rather complex nature neces-sitating in-depth studies. As every high-k material, [ 36 ] Sr:HfO 2 is characterized by a certain amount of oxygen vacancies within the material (see Supporting Information S4 for an estimate). The application of the alternating bipolar cycling voltage represents the main source of stress: It causes the injection of charges into existing vacancies, which can change the polarization state of the ferroe-lectric material via local fi eld modifi cations [ 21 ] as well as domain de-/pinning. This can result in either a rise or a degradation of the remnant polarization. Furthermore, the applied fi eld can either generate new O/Hf vacancies or force the existing ones to diffuse along the material. As a consequence of the vacancy diffusion and generation, a portion of the device volume can undergo a phase transformation. This transformation into a switching or nonswitching phase together with the k-value change can either impede or facilitate the ferroelectric response by changing the internal bias fi eld. In the following, these mechanisms will be assessed in detail, using a special series of",583

As discussed before, the wake-up effect is attributed to the gradual decrease of the built-in bias fi eld. These could be due to the O vacancy defect redistribution that can change their charge state, and/or partial phase transition and k-value change within The initial scenario of different biased regions and the so-called built-in fi elds was created by preferentially highest density of the vacancies in the interfacial regions ( Figure6 ). Furthermore, the same scenario was used to simulate the pref-the layer. erable movement of the vacancies driven by the applied electric The same model was also used for the simulation of the leakage current evolution with cycling (see Figure 1 c), which allows extracting the increase in the density of O vacancy defects within the stack. The increase of density of the oxygen vacancy defects seems correlated with the Pr evolution observed with cycling, Figure 3 b. However, it should be noted that the density of defects evaluated from the leakage current corre-sponds mainly to those located at the grain boundaries, where they contribute the most to the leakage current. [ 45 ] Namely, the leakage current thought the grain boundaries is more than tenfold higher than through the grain itself. Thus, the diffu-sion of the vacancies thought the grain would keep the leakage current constant during the wake-up stage. The role of O vacancy/ion diffusion is also consistent to the fact that HfO 2 based devices are known for their high oxygen mobility. [ 18 ] This claim becomes even more strengthened by the fact that the electric fi eld applied on the HfO 2 -based ferroelectrics is at least one order of magnitude higher than that, typically applied fi eld. In order to investigate the physics of the wake-up process, bipolar cycling stress simulations were performed using the MDLab simulation package, which allows the description of charge and ionic transport. As shown in the Figure 6 a–c, the O vacancies redistribute uniformly within the grain. Moreover, besides this drift/diffusion process, a recombination of vacan-cies and interstitial ions can also occur. As a consequence, the built-in bias fi eld decreases. A more uniform fi eld distribution is created within the stack, resulting in a uniform switching of all domains within the device (see Figure 6 d–f). An increase of the temperature kinetically accelerates the vacancy diffusion resulting in more mobile vacancies and faster wake-up, which is in agreement to Figure 2 e. In order to confi rm the infl uence of the temperature observed in the wake-up characterization on elevated temperatures, the simulation was repeated at 150 °C. The uniform fi eld distribution was achieved two orders of mag-nitude faster than in the room temperature case, which cor-responds to the",633

Pesic_Miko_Cycling_modeling_AFM_2016.docx,results,"that show the transition of the initially tetragonal phase of nonswitching TM-HfO 2 interface to orthorhombic phase (switching) for the woken up device. A thickness reduction of this dead layer [ 34 ] on the interface decreases the infl uence of the parasitic voltage divider and increases the ferroelectric switching response of the device. Thus, the remnant polarization increases during the wake-up. Although the vacancies move toward the middle of the device, the leakage current stays constant because it is dominated by the leakage through the grain boundaries and not through the grain volume. Therefore, vacancies that move during the wake up phase, indeed increase the leakage current component through the grains however insignifi cantly to be seen in the total current. Moreover, the observed phase tran-sition (M → O phase) increases the k-value of the stack. This reduces the fi eld driven leakage transport mechanisms coun-teracting the aforementioned negligible increase of the leakage component via the grain volume. In parallel to the compact modeling of the diffusion pro-cesses and evolution of the fi eld distribution within the device, a ferroelectric switching modeling is needed to compare the charge and fi eld infl uence on the switching of the device. Accordingly, a 3D ferroelectric capacitor model was set-up in Synopsys TCAD Structure Editor. [ 38 ] The model is illustrated in To model the ferroelectric behavior a physical model accounting for the history dependence of ferroelectric devices is required. In case of a ferroelectric capacitor the charge-voltage relationship is nonlinear and represents a second term of the dielectric displacement vector (see Supporting Information S5 for details). This complex behavior is very similar to the Prei-sach hysteresis model, which is used for ferromagnetic and fer-roelectric materials [ 51 ] and it is implemented within Sentaurus Device. [ 38 ] Properties of the modeled ferroelectric material can be found in the Supporting Information S6, where the para-meters are tuned in order to obtain the desired characteristics. Every measured capacitor consists of thousands of grains, [ 50 ] which all might have a slight different domain orientation, coercive fi eld or remnant polarization. To address the vari-ability in the resulting switching characteristics, each of the modelled grains represents an averaged ensemble of domains and grains with similar properties, which are defi ned by a distinct coercive fi eld and remnant polarization value. Coer-cive fi elds used within the grains were chosen in the range of 1.6–2.9 MV cm −1 which is in accordance to the coercive fi eld distribution obtained by FORC measurements (see Supporting Information S1). Moreover, the remnant polarization of the grains was distributed between the 15 and 24 µC cm −2 . Finally, a nonlocal mesh is constructed in order to calculate the tun-neling currents and to couple the traps with the electrodes. The initial stack is also affected by the presence of defects, whose charge can unpredictably alter the local fi eld, affecting the ferroelectric switching performances. To account for this effect, it was considered that oxygen vacancies are preferentially 4608Figure 5 b. distributed at the interfacial regions. These regions are mainly wileyonlinelibrary.com© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAdv. Funct.Mater.2016, 26, 4601–4612www.MaterialsViews.commade of tetragonal phase HfO x , with higher permittivity, which in turn affects also the local fi eld. Moreover, these regions are considered nonswitching in the pristine, i.e., they act as a passive (dead) layer. [ 34 ] Fur-thermore, monoclinic (nonswitching phase) was modeled setting the grains to a low-k nonswitching state. Using the Preisach model implemented in Sentaurus device simu-lator, a double peak I – V characteristic as well as a pinched hysteresis loop was successfully simulated (see Figure 6 c).

This behavior inevitably coincides with progressive de-trapping of electrons from occupied defects. The longer the waiting time, more defects were de-trapped, 3.2.

In addition, an earlier onset of the Having detailedly discussed the effects dominating the so-called wake-up, which lead to an enhancement of the ferroelec-tric properties during the initial cycles, the subsequent gradual degradation of these properties is studied. As shown in Figures 1 c and 3 b, there is a direct correla-tion between the increase of the defect concentration and the degradation of the MW. Using the thermochemical bond breakage model implemented in the MDLab software, [ 37,44,52 ] it was found that a faster O vacancy defect generation occurs at the TiO x interface toward the electrodes. These low quality, nonswitching regions are characterized by more defects and a lower permittivity, resulting in a higher factor of degradation and faster bond breakage. The defect generation and the sub-sequent charge trapping infl uence the fi eld distribution over the device stack. The fi eld over the interface increases, while it reduces inside the ferroelectric bulk. [ 35 ] Thus, the ferroelec-tric layer experiences a lower switching fi eld, which leads to a reduced number of switching domains if the coercive fi eld of some domains is not reached anymore. Furthermore, charge trapping creates dipoles impeding the switching of the domains, which",451

Besides that, the vacancy generation and dif-fusion through the grains continue. In contrast to the wake-up phase, the continued cycling is not only characterized by vacancies diffusion, but also by a vacancy generation within the grains. These defect sites, fi nally, start representing sig-nifi cant leakage current path besides previously dominating leakage through the grain boundaries.

Milan_FEFET_reliability_IEDM_2018.docx,Abstract,"—Discovery of ferroelectric (FE) behavior in HfO2 removed the compatibility roadblocks between the state-of-the-art CMOS and FE memories. Even though FE FETs (FeFETs) are scaled into 22 nm nodes and beyond, the limits of the technology as well as the physical mechanisms and reliability are still under research. In this paper we successfully developed a multiscale modeling platform to understand the interplay between the FE switching and charge trapping. Starting from the nucleation theory and rigorous charge transport modeling we present for the first time a self-consistent modeling framework we used for investigation of reliability and variability in FeFETs. I. DEVICE AND MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATIONThe Ferroelectric FETs (FeFETs) represent the core of both low-power non-volatile memory (NVM) solutions and the low-power negative capacitance (NC) logic. Despite the ferroelectricity (FE) in HfO2 has triggered diverse research and enabled demonstration on 22nm technology nodes [1], the comprehensive understanding of both materials and devices is still under debate. Particularly, the interplay between charge trapping and ferroelectric switching, and its impact on the switching kinetics as well as on the reliability and variability of the device is not clear. Thus, the quantitative understanding of the charge trapping and nucleation interplay is crucial. In detail, the key questions to be answered are: (1) How does the interplay between ferroelectric switching and the charge trapping in HfO2 influence the performance and scalability of FeFETs; (2) what are the boundary conditions for a reliable operation; (3) how can the material properties be tailored to achieve the maximum reliability for such devices? Polarization reversal due to the application of the gate voltage sets the FeFET into high and low VTH state (Fig.1). The characterization of FeFET (28nm bulk FET under test) considered for NVM applications shows that during endurance testing the closure of the memory window (MW=VTH+-VTH-) starts at the point when the charge trapping begins to dominate the FE switching process (Fig.2). To investigate the complexity of the switching process and find optimal operation conditions, we recorded the program/erase (PRG/ERS) matrices, Fig. 3. Within these maps, three regions can be identified: (1) a region of negative MW where charge trapping (CT) dominates; (2) a region of negligible MW (CT compensates the FE switching); (3) and a region of positive MW where the FE switching dominates. Fig. 4 shows the evolution of these regions with field cycling, exhibiting a drift of the switching region towards pulses with lower amplitude, stabilizing at amplitudes of around -4 and -5 V and short pulses (1 µs). After 105 PRG/ERS cycles the CT completely compensates the MW of the FeFET resulting in negative or zero MW. Moreover, the evolution of density of interfacial states reported in [3] indicates that bipolar stress generated by PRG/ERS and the subsequent charging and discharging (carriers tunnel back and forth) degrade the interface properties. Consequently, the increased defect density and deteriorating interface properties may impact the switching kinetics of the FeFET. II.MULTI-SCALE MODELING PLATFORMTo capture the aforementioned FE switching - CT interplay and reproduce the FE-device kinetics as well as to understand the physical mechanisms behind, we extended a multiscale modeling platform (Fig. 5). This modeling platform is comprised of two main parts, consistently connected, which address the charge transport and stress-induced material modifications, respectively. These are crucial to model device aging and reliability phenomena [4]. The capability to handle individual contributions of atomic species and defects (i.e. interstitial ions and vacancies) is included, along with their diffusion and generation processes. In parallel, the FE properties of the film responsible for switching processes and kinetics are also accounted for. The electric potential within the FE-device is calculated by solving the Poisson equation consistently with time dependent Ginzburg-Landau formalism enriched with the domain interaction and depolarization term. Parameters used in the study are listed in [5,6]. III.CHARGE TRAPPING AND NUCLEATION INTERPLAYA.Charge trapping Multiphonon charge transport mechanisms dominated by trap-assisted-tunneling are used to investigate the charge transport within the device whose geometry and doping is depicted in Fig. 6a. We investigated the FE-device behavior by simulating the ID-VG evolution during a PRG/ERS cycle. First a device under test was preconditioned and set in the low VTH state to maintain the reference state. As shown in Fig.6b, charge trapping",1031

To investigate the impact of the PRG/ERS on the bulk defects in the HfO2 layer, we monitored and simulated (using a TAT model) the leakage current [7], which allows extracting the defect density evolution with stress shown in Fig.8b-c. This increase remains limited as the current transport is dominated by conduction band conduction. Evolving concentration is omitted deliberately due to the combined effect of defect concentration and switching state of the device (details in the polarized device is characterized with a higher leakage compared to the non-switched device (13b). To gain insight into the kinetics of the trapping, we set the device in different PRG states and simulated a charge trapping (Fig.13c-d) and gate transients (VG, IG) upon application of a single pulse. The comparison of charge trapping kinetics simulated considering both conventional non-switching HfO2 FET and programmed FeFET shows that the increased band-bending (induced by FE switching) impedes the charge trapping (for this scanning voltage and extracted defect distribution) within the stack, decreasing the trapped- ΔVTH, but increases the gate leakage. To gain insight into the kinetics of the device and competing processes of charge trapping and FE switching we simulated the section B). FE-gate stack response upon application of the positive gate B.Interplay between charge trapping and nucleation The impact of interfacial/bulk defect states on FeFET variability is assessed through Monte Carlo simulations, allowing to investigate the impact of the scaling and defects of the polycrystalline stack on the VTH distribution (Fig.9a). The impact of the defects and trapped charge on the potential within the gate stack is shown in Fig.9b. To assess the impact of the FE-HfO2 material changes on FE-device performances (including variability and reliability), we show in Fig. 10 the simulation of the evolution of the FE domain orientation over time upon the application of the external excitation field. These domain maps represent a top view of the gate of the FE-transistor with source and drain on the left and right side, respectively. The 2D domain map shows a clear domain reorientation from the initial random condition to a common oriented state, which proves that the model captures nucleation occurring upon application of the electric field. The model accounts self-consistently for the potential changes due to the domain nucleation, as shown in the corresponding potential maps in Fig.11a.

Additionally, impact of the different grains (FE switching properties) along the width of device on single device performance was investigated (considering the average grain size of 20-30 nm, 30x80nm FeFET has in average 3 grain along the channel; see [8]). It can be seen that the worst domain (lowest MW when alone) determines the MW of the device (without trapping effects included). Still averaging effect is observable when portion of device is non-FE or pinned; in turn impacting the device to device variation of the FeFET. In the next step we switched on previously calibrated charge trapping into the model. The band diagrams extracted from the grain 1 and grain 2 (Fig.11a) are shown in Fig.13a. Different field over the device changes the dynamics of the charge carrier injection (Fig.13b-c) which in turn impacts the nucleation of domains along the width of the channel (Fig. 14). Same impact has a band bending and injection level change due to the variation of the program pulse amplitude. Using the developed model, we show that gate leakage is determined by the conduction band transport (similar to FE tunnel junction), thus voltage pulse. Compared to the reference device (without defects and charge trapping), the device with CT effects included (Fig. 15a-b) shows that trapping pins the field at the interface, inducing a stronger change in the field across the FE:HfO2, which forces an earlier onset of FE switching (mono-domain) and ability to reach previously inactive “slow” domains (Fig. 14) in multi-domain case.

Highly doped n-type silicon was The memory market is currently in an era of tremendous growth: the big data explosion has yielded the need for more and more data storage. Although 3-D NAND memory is a high density and cost-effective technology, it still suffers from some drawbacks, i.e. speed, cell size and power consumption at system level due to required periphery (e.g. charge pumps). Addressing these issues while keeping the advantages of this technology would be very appealing. Recent years have seen a growing interest in ferroelectric (FE) memory applications. The discovery in 2011 of FE hafnium oxide enabled the emergence of scaled FE devices [1].

This is a known issue for HfO2 FeFET [6], which needs to be addressed through process integration optimization. A thick oxide, without special treatment or film improvement, was used, leading to large PRG/ERS voltages. This could be seen as too high for FE, however this corresponds to an electric field of ~ 6.5 MV/cm and is in agreement with the P-V loop shown in Fig. 3. A thinner gate oxide would reduce the operation voltage and additionally improve the reliability, i.e. reduce trapping and enhance endurance. Detailed reliability studies are required for better understanding of the device behavior, i.e. impact of pass voltages.

The evolution of VT with cycling is shown in Fig. 11. Closure of the MW was observed at 104 cycles. A slight wake up period of around 10 cycles was initially observed. This was followed by a decrease in the MW. While the ERS state decreased slightly with cycling, the PRG state was much more impacted by the endurance possibly due to trapping [6]. Fig. 12 shows the PRG and ERS density distributions after 10 cycles. The device-to-device variability may be caused by differences in defect distribution and charge injection as well as variable FE properties, that can be affected by a combination of factors such as film uniformity and mechanical stress.

masuduzzaman_hotatomdamage_FE_TED_2014.docx,Abstract,"—Ferroelectric materials are the most common exam-ple of a Landau structure, defined as a system having an atom/mass moving in a double-well energy landscape. These materials have applications in memories, actuators, low power logic transistors, and so on. For a bipolar ac signal typical in most of the applications, one suspects that the repeated roller coaster shuttling of the moving atoms located microscopically at the domain walls could lead to bond dissociation, suggesting a new channel for defect generation with no classical counterpart. Here, we demonstrate that once the bipolar pulses initiate transfer of atoms between the energy pockets, the transient overshoot away from their equilibrium positions (hot atoms) leads to significant increase in defect generation. We interpret the degradation theoretically and demonstrate a set of soft-switching schemes to control the hot atom damage and to improve the device lifetime dramatically. The damage mechanism should be generic in other Landau structures, such as microelectromechanical systems, nonvolatile memories, and analogous control strategies should improve the lifetime of all such bistable devices.Index Terms—Defect generation, ferroelectrics, Landau structure, microelectromechanical system (MEMS), negative capacitance, phase transition materials.I.",278

A typical example is the ferroelectric switching, where the microscopic displacement of the central atom (e.g., Ti/Zr for lead–zirconate–titanate or PZT) between the two stable configurations, leads to the switching polarization hundreds of times larger than that of the classical dielectrics. This large switchable polarization is the basis of commercial and emerging memory technologies such as FeRAM [2], [7], logic devices that would allow sub-60 mV/decade switching [5], [6], and so forth.Duringthemacroscopicpolarizationswitchingofaferroelectric material, the domain walls move across the sample [8]–[10]. During this process, the atoms located within the domain walls flip from one microscopic state to another. During this microscopic switching, the transitioning atoms within the domain walls overcome an energy barrier and undergo a characteristic roller coaster movement between the pair of energy pockets [Fig. 1(a)]. This suggests a potential of transient overshoot of these atoms away from the ther-modynamically stable energy minima during each switching at ac bias. These localized, energetic (hot) atoms at the domain walls, further assisted by stochastic absorption of lattice phonons, may stretch the bonds beyond the breaking point—leading to defect formation. We coin the term “hot atom damage” to describe the bond dissociation phenomenon associated with the energetic moving atoms in any Landau structure, such as a memory material. The generated defects along with the preexisting defects in the ferroelectric material could self-organize, and/or capture electrons, and assist the traditional fatigue [11], [12], increase leakage, or might lead to dielectric breakdown [13]. This negative reliability aspect of materials with movable atoms under bipolar ac pulse is intuitively plausible, and has long been indirectly reflected in fatigue [14] and erratic dielectric lifetime [13] of ferroelectric memories, or analogous reliability concerns in microelectro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices [15]; however, the very existence of hot atoms (in materials where atoms move as part of switching) as a precursor of new defect formation has never been established, and more importantly—strategies to address the hot atom damage have not been demonstrated.

masuduzzaman_hotatomdamage_FE_TED_2014.docx,experiment,"s are based on typical polycrys-talline PZT ferroelectric samples (thickness ∼70 nm) with iridium (Ir) bottom and IrO2 top electrodes [16]. First, consider the kinetics of defect generation under a dc stress as a reference point. A dc stress stretches the bond within a single energy pocket, but does not involve periodic oscillations of atoms between the pockets [Fig. 1(b.i)]. Any transient over-shoot occurs only once and dies immediately after the dc bias is applied, and thus the role of hot atoms in defect formation is negligible. Instead, a dc bias increases the bond dissociation probability ( f ) by reducing the activation energy, E′A, sinceEA0 is the activation energy at the relaxed condition, Eloc is f ∼ exp(−E′A/kT ) [17], where E′A= EA0− (pi × Eloc),the local electric field, and pi is the polarization of individual bonds (significant for bonds involving the central Ti/Zr atom of PZT lattice), and kT reflects the average phonon energy available for (stochastic) bond dissociation. As defects are generated, leakage current through the capacitor increases. The reference lifetime, defined by a leakage current threshold [18] (Appendix A) for the dc stress is shown in Fig. 1(c.i).To explore the implications of the polarization switching on defect generation, we design [19] a set of pulses with fixed top (VH), but variable bottom (VL) levels, as shownin Fig. 1(b.ii–v). The pulse amplitude (VA) is modulated by gradually lowering VL. As long as the pulse is non-switching, that is, VL is greater than the lower coercive voltage (−VC), the atoms are confined within a single energy pocket [Fig. 1(b.ii and iii)]. The transient overshoot (the hot atom phenomenon) is minimum and the defect generation is dictated by VH. As a result, the lifetime is reduced only slightly from that of the dc stress [Fig. 1(c.i–iii)]. However, once VL crosses the lower coercive voltage (i.e., a switching pulse is applied), the Ti/Zr atoms at the domain walls are forced to switch to the neighboring energy pockets and is heated significantly by the transient overshoot. Because of the repeated domain wall motion, the defect generation increases dramatically across the entire volume of the ferroelectric, and is reflected in sharply reduced lifetime [Fig. 1(c.iv and v)]. This explicit threshold of leakage-limited lifetime related to the coercive voltage implies that the polarization switching generates defects and reduces the lifetime during the switching ac stress. Note that, since phonon energy is relatively small, the probability that a specific bond would break in any given cycle, especially at low fields, is small. However, the number of atoms undergoing the transition is so large (of the order of 1/a3 l, where al is the lattice constant) that a finite number of defects are generated in each cycle; these defects accumulate over time that leads to increased leakage through the sample [18], [20].3492 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 61, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2014Fig. 2. Physical model for the hot atom damage. (a) Polarization dynamics is shown for an applied ac pulse. For every switching event, there is an associated overshoot in polarization (�p0, with time constant τ) giving more energy to the associated bonds. (b) Contribution of different bias components to the total bond energy is shown schematically. The dc bias increases the bond energy to some extent, which is further enhanced by an ac pulse overshoot. The rest of the energy is taken from the lattice phonons to reach the bond-breaking energy. As shown in (c), the overshoot is much higher for a switching pulse (red) than a nonswitching pulse (green). p/pr = ±1 (horizontal lines: two equilibrium polarization states at zero bias), where pr is the remnant polarization. (d) Calculated lifetime for different ac pulses with varying VL and fixed VH (>Vc) shows a significant reduction in lifetime (more than an order of magnitude), for VL < −Vc, that is, when the nonswitching pulses change to switching pulses [Fig. 1(b)].For further verification of the switching-induced damage, periodically. The corresponding equation of motion is given we apply a switching pulse train with very narrow pulse-width by(∼500 ns), so that any effect caused by the dc stress compo-nent is suppressed (Appendix B). The evolution of the leakage current (a measure of cumulative defect generation) shows very little dependence on frequency, and it depends almost exclusively on the number of the switching pulses [Fig. 1(d)], confirming the essential role of the switching in creating hot atom damage. Also, because switching occurs throughout the volume of the ferroelectric material, hot atom damage is a bulk phenomenon. This is evidenced from the increased leakage current (see Appendix C for supporting",1107

At nominal operation defect generation is reduced and robust endurance has been demonstrated [21].III. THEORETICAL MODELThe physical origin of this switching-assisted hot atom damage within the bulk region can be phenomenologically described by the Landau theory of oscillator in an double-well energy landscape [22], coupled to an elementary ther-mochemical model of bond dissociation and defect generation [17]. For a dc applied field, the local microscopic polarization pi for the Ti/Zr atom is a constant depending on the field. But for an ac electric field, as the domain walls move back and forth, the local Ti/Zr atoms, and hence pi(t), oscillatesM d2 pi dt2 + � dpi dt− F(pi) = E(t) (1)where M and � are the inertial and damping coefficients, respectively, which depend on the intrinsic material properties and extrinsic circuit elements (Appendix D), E(t) is the external applied field, and F(pi) is the field term related to the total system energy U, as F(pi) = −dU/dpi, where U = a/2p2 coefficients for the ferroelectric, and k is the first-neighbor i+ b/4p4 i+ k∇ pi. Here a, b are the Landaucoupling constant for switching [22].Equation (1) can be solved to find pi(t) for any arbitrary applied pulse E(t), for example, the square pulse, as in Fig. 2(a). As the pulse switches from VH to VL or vice versa, there is a microscopic polarization overshoot associated with the transition, as expected. The overshoot (�p0) decays expo-nentially to the final polarization level p0, with a characteristic stored energy within the bond, and greater susceptibility time constant of τ ∼ 2M/�. A higher �p0 implies increased to phonon-assisted bond dissociation [Fig. 2(b)]. Since the lifetime (∼1/ f ) depends exponentially on EA, it reduces dramatically when the transient overshoot �p0 becomes comparable with p0. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the overshoot�p0 is considerably higher for a switching pulse (VL < −VC) compared with a nonswitching pulse (VL > −V C), for same VH.

Guided by the theory, we have also demonstrated a set of soft-switching schemes to reduce the hot atom damage and increase the lifetime dramatically. We find it not surprising that similar schemes (e.g., pulse-shaping [26] and series resis-tance [15]) have been effective in reducing damage due to hard-landing in micro- and nanoelectromechanical switches, because, after all, MEMS is also governed by analogous bistable energy landscape (a Landau structure). The generality of the formulation thus suggests future exploration of such hot atom damage, as well as the control mechanisms, in all bistable phase transition processes, such as MEMS, ferroic materials (multiferroics, ferromagnetics, and so on), resistive RAM and other nonvolatile memories and devices.APPENDIX ATo measure the defects generated in the PZT dielectric after any arbitrary stress, we use a small sense voltage (typically 0.5 V) to measure the leakage current through the oxide.

This measure-stress-measure (MSM) method is a standard procedure for damage measurement for any arbitrary stress. As the defects are generated owing to the stress, the leakage current increases as a function of time, as shown in Fig. 4(c). A threshold level of leakage current is used to define the leakage-limited lifetime. It is very important to use a low sense voltage in the MSM measurements, because the high background leakage current at the stress voltage (dc) makes it difficult to monitor any incremental increase in leakage due to the defectination of contacts [11], [12], [23], and so on.

Because ferroelectric switching would always involve transi-tion of atoms between wells separated by an energy barrier, we believe that the hot atom damage should, in principle, occur, in varying degrees of importance, in all ferroelectric materials, such as, PZT, SBT, PVDF, doped HfO2 [23]–[25], and so on. The methodology presented in this paper (e.g., test patterns, ramp rates, and so on) can be used to quantify the hot atom damage in various materials.Finally, to summarize, we have identified the hot atom damage during ferroelectric switching through a broad rangeFor a ferroelectric switching",178

For example, during normal operation, the nominal operating voltage for switching of the PZT is VH = 1.5 V and VL = −1.5 V (here VC = 0.5 V). However, to accelerate the defect generation so that the lifetime falls within the measurement time limit (<105s), either or both of the pulse levels should be increased to some stress voltage. In our case, we only increased VH to the stress level (∼4.6 V), whereas VL is kept at a nominal voltage of 1.5 V [Fig. 5(a)], so that we only have one control variable for the voltage acceleration measurement.

However, for a square pulse at low frequencies, we find that the lifetime does not scale linearly with frequency. This is because T+ Sbecomes significant at low frequencies, and the damage is dominated by the dc stress.

A pulse with the desired shape is periodically interrupted at the sense voltage to measure the damage using the leakage current. (c) Leakage current evolution (shown for three differentAPPENDIX Csamples) as a function of stress time at the sense voltage indicates creation of defects within the oxide. A threshold in leakage current (horizontal dashed line) has been used to define the leakage-limited dielectric lifetime.therefore, the lifetime is identical irrespective of the particular symmetrical choice of VH or VL for the voltage acceleration.Now, besides pulse levels, the duty cycle is also an impor-tant consideration for the following reason: a pulse exerts two different types of stresses—the switching stress during each transition and the dc stresses at the positive and the negative bias plateaus. The effective stress duration for the switching frequency), and for dc stress as the time T+ stress is measured as the number of cycle (Cy = time ×[Fig. 5(a)]. Because the damage modes could be very different T−S= tL × Cy, for positive and negative biases, respectively S= tH × Cy, andin these two stress conditions and we need to examine only the effect of switching stress, we must avoid dc stressing in both positive and negative biases. As mentioned, the dc stressing at the negative bias is already avoided by keepingdamage is negligible within our measurement time window). VL at the nominal level (i.e., VL = −1.5 V, where theHowever, to avoid the dc stressing at the positive bias, while still maintaining VH at a stress level, we use a narrow pulse train (a very low and fixed value of tH). For example, withDuring ferroelectric switching, as the domain wall pro-gresses, microscopic switching is expected in every functional unit cell across the bulk of the oxide, and the hot atom damage should occur stochastically over the volume of the ferroelectric film (bulk phenomenon). Besides the increased leakage current, this bulk characteristics is also reflected in capacitance measurements. Fig. 6(a) shows that after a dc (or a nonswitching ac) stress, there is no significant degra-dation of capacitance. However, after a switching ac stress for a similar duration, there is substantial capacitance degradation, indicating a significant bulk damage caused by the switching polarization.The lifetime distribution for dc and switching stress also offers an alternate way to verify this bulk damage phenomenon, as follows. Previously, we have shown that, at dc stress, the leakage current path primarily consists of the grain boundaries (GBs) for a polycrystalline PZT, which have large number of preexisting defects [27]. On the other hand, at switching-ac stress, the microscopic switching mainly occurs at the grains and switching is inefficient at the GBs owing to the defective cells. Therefore, new defects are primarily generated at the grain regions. As a result, the stress-generated leakage path should consist of the gain regions. Because the grain regions have much less preexisting defect density3496 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 61, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2014Fig. 6. Bulk characteristics of hot atom damage.

(b) Cumulative failure fraction (F) for 35 samples with dc stress and 18 samples with switching-ac stress shows much higher βac in a Weibull plot. Unlike the dc stress, the leakage path at switching-ac stress occurs within the grain region, and therefore a steeper distribution (βac > βdc ) is expected and observed.than the GB regions, one would expect from the classical percolation-based dielectric breakdown theory [28]–[30] that the lifetime distribution at ac stress should be much sharper than that of the dc stress (because more defects are required to cause a breakdown through a grain).

Published by AIP Publishing.[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4978032]The initial report on the ferroelectric behavior of doped hafnium oxide (HfO2) has used as doping material less than 4% mol. SiO2. The ferroelectric HfO2 has a 10 nm thickness, the ferroelectric phase being attributed to an orthorhombic crystalline structure.1The physical mechanisms for occur-rence of the ferroelectric phase in HfO2, as well as in ZrO2, are detailed in several papers.2,3 The discovery of ferroelectric HfO2 is of tremendous importance since, although ferroelectric materials are involved in many applications, only perovskite ferroelectrics such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 or PZT have been used up to now. In micro- or nanoelectronics, perovskite ferroelectrics are not fully compati-ble with CMOS technology and suffer from limited scalability. Therefore, ferroelectric random access memories,4ferroelec-tric transistors for low-power applications,5,6or high-mobility graphene transistors on ferroelectric substrates7show moderate developments or are in infancy. In deep contrast, HfO2 depos-ited via the atomic-layer-deposition (ALD) method is fully compatible with CMOS technologies and is commonly used as a high-k dielectric in widespread devices based on the CMOS technology, such as i-phones, laptops, computers, and TV-sets. So, ferroelectric HfO2 could enable various applications work-ing at low DC voltages.In the case of high-frequency applications, the tunability of devices and circuits is a prerequisite for further development of radars, wireless communications, internet, and internet of things. All these high-frequency systems require a precise con-trol of the parameters of devices and circuits, which must quickly adapt to sudden changes in the communication envi-ronment. The electrical tunability of high-frequency devices implying specific materials such as ferroelectrics, polymers, and liquid crystals is a mature domain, recently reviewed in Ref. 8. In principle, all future spatial or terrestrial communica-tions will require Si-, GaAs-, or GaN-based circuits witha)Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Namely, the required DC voltage for tuning the frequency or the phase of such devices attains values of tens or even hundreds of volts, depending on the ferroelectric material.9 It is thus the role of this paper to show that high-frequency devices such as filters, phase shifters, and antennas can be tuned with only few volts when ferroelectric HfO2 is used. The",717
dragoman_tunable_FE_APL_2017.docx,results,"presented in this paper are based on two major advantages of the hafnium oxide ferroelectric, pointed out in Ref. 4: (i) HfO2 has a remanent polarization in the 1–45 lC/cm2range, depending on doping, still present up to 5 nm thickness, while in films of perovskite ferroelectrics thinner than tens of nm the remanent polarization is lost and (ii) ferroelectric HfO2 has a giant critical electric field of 1–2 MV/cm, which is one order of magnitude higher than in perovskite ferroelectrics.Using the available data in Refs. 2 and 4 for the ferro-electric Hf0.3Zr0.7O2, we present first in the following the design and simulations of a tunable filter in the X band. The ferroelectric properties of Hf0.3Zr0.7O2 originate in the replacement of Hf atoms in HfO2 doped with Zr, which has a similar size and chemical valence to Hf.The dielectric permittivity Hf0.3Zr0.7O2 as a function of the applied voltage, extracted from",263

The filter has a bandwidth of 400 MHz and shows low losses. Low losses are expected since the measurements of the microwave behaviour of haf-nium oxide on high-resistive Si indicate in the X band tan d ¼ 0:05.10 Further, we have developed a phase shifter cell consisting of a gold interdigitated (IDT) capacitor integrated in a CPW configuration, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The CPW is composed of three gold electrodes (the yellow regions in Fig. 3(a)) with a thickness of 200 nm deposited over 10 nm Hf0.3Zr0.7O2 grown on 100 lm-thick high resistive Si. The central (signal) elec-trode of the CPW has a width of 100 lm, being separated from the ground electrodes by a gap of 50 lm. The IDT capacitor digit width is 5 lm, while the gap between two con-secutive digits is 10lm. The transition between the IDT capacitor and the CPW line is made by a taper.The simulation",681

At the same time, the IDT capacitance changes in the range 1.714 pF up to 2.192 pF at 10 GHz showing a resonance between 11 GHz and 12 GHz. The IDT capacitance was calculated using the formula C ¼ Im Y11 These data are then used to design a phase shifter having Þ=x.14 IDT capacitors connected in series, the distance between two consecutive capacitors being 1mm.

dragoman_tunable_FE_APL_2017.docx,results,", obtained with a CST simulator, it can be seen that the phase shift at 10 GHz between the phases at þ0.3 V and �3 V is about 58.57 degrees. In addition, from Fig. 3(b) it follows that there are certain frequencies at which a phase shift of even 360�is possible. Such a very large phase shift can be used for electronic scanning of the beam of an antenna array.In this respect, we consider further an antenna array composed of two patch antennas on 10nm Hf0.3Zr0.7O2 ferroelectric deposited on top of 100 lm-thick high resistive Si, all dimensions being indicated in Fig. 4(a). Numerical simula-tions of this array performed using CST confirmed that the iso-lation between the two antennas at 10GHz is �44.72 dB, which is a very good value. Both antennas display jS11j ¼ jS22j ¼ �16.52dB at 10 GHz, i.e., a voltage standing If the previously studied phase shifter with 14 IDT wave ratio (VSWR) ¼ 1.352, which indicates a good matching. capacitors is introduced now between antennas 1 and 2, the phase varies continuously between 60.23�and 118.8�with a total phase shift of D/ ¼ 58.57�as the bias is swept from�3 V to þ0.3 V. As a result, the radiation pattern at 10 GHz is steered with 632�, as can be seen from Fig. 4(b). The radi-ation efficiency is 15% due to the fact that the substrate thickness, of about k0=300, is very thin compared with the corresponding wavelength at 10 GHz.The",401
dragoman_tunable_FE_APL_2017.docx,experiment,"al data we have used are the most accu-rate and among few available to date extracted from a MIM capacitor TiN/HfO2/TiN with the thickness of the TiN layer of 10 nm grown on Si (the conception of tunability of HfO2 ferroelectric MIM for RF applications is suggested also in Ref. 11). The choice of TiN as the electrode is justified by the fact that this n-type wide band gap semiconductor, with a resistivity of 0.4 X cm and bandgap of 3.4 eV, induces a mechanical stress in HfO2 preserving its ferroelectric state and suppressing the phase transition to the paraelectric phase. The workfunction of TiN is 4.6 eV, which is close to the corresponding value (4.7 eV) in polycrystalline Au in ambient conditions. Since the thickness of Au is twenty times larger than that of TiN and the free-space wavelength involved in this paper is of order of few cm, the TiN capping layer plays practically no role in the electromagnetic simula-tion. In addition, it was already shown that12the electrical and physical characteristics of TiN/HfO2/TiN and Si/HfO2/ TiN capacitors are very similar, which suggests that the dielectric values obtained from Refs. 2 and 4 can be used for simulating HfO2-based ferroelectric compounds on Si. This result is strengthened by another study (Ref. 13 and the refer-ences therein), which shows that Si has a similar role to TiN, namely, it prevents HfO2 to switch from the ferroelectric to the paraelectric phase due to thermal expansion mismatchFIG. 4.

Recently, short-period BaTiO3 /SrTiO3 superlattices, with modulation lengths down to ten perovskite layers, have been grown on SrTiO3 sub-strates using pulsed-laser deposition1and reactive molecular-beam epitaxy.2These superlattices are reportedly free of dis-locations and coherently matched to the substrate, implying misfit strains of over 2% in the BaTiO3 layers. Strains of this magnitude are expected to increase the spontaneous polarization,3,4and the superlattice geometry preserves the high-strain state and prevents relaxation of the BaTiO3 �BT�layers, raising the possibility of an artificial material with polarization greater than many conventional ferroelectrics. But since the BT layers are interleaved with SrTiO3 �ST�, which has zero polarization in the bulk, the degree to which the overall polarization might be enhanced in the superlattice remains in question.In this letter, we address this issue directly through a series of first-principles density functional calculations on short-period BT/ST superlattices with varying composition. We find that these superlattices are ferroelectric, and predict that some possess polarizations significantly larger than bulk BT. An atomic-level analysis also reveals a significant non-zero polarization and strain in the ST layers, a direct result of internal polarizing fields originating in the BT layers.

Neaton et al APL 2003 Theory of polarization	enhancement in epitaxial BTO-STO superlattices.docx,conclusion,", we have shown, using a series of first-principles calculations, that significant polarization enhance-ment can be achieved in perovskite oxide superlattices. This enhancement arises from the combined effects of strain, in-duced in the BT layers by the epitaxial growth, and internal electric fields, associated with the superlattice geometry, which polarize the ST layers. The induced polarization ob-served here complements a previous prediction of ferroelec-tricity in ST layers under epitaxial stress.3,16Our analysis reveals important physical factors that influence the behavior of the superlattice system for given constituent layers and thickness, which will aid in the prediction of properties of a wider class of systems and provide a valuable guide for the design of artificially structured materials.The authors thank C.

Lomenzo_NaMLab_ACS_AMI_2020.docx,Introduction,"78910111213Ferroelectric hysteresis has long been the benchmark technique to characterize the macroscopic 141516properties of ferroelectric materials. Plotting dynamic polarization vs. electric field can be traced 1718back to 1930 with the original Sawyer-Tower circuit.1 The measurement circuit itself has gone 1920through many iterations, but the unique features and extracted parameters of the hysteresis loop 212223are hallmarks of ferroelectric material properties.2 Hysteresis loops are frequently the only direct 2425measurement of macroscopic ferroelectric properties, but the phenomena of pinched hysteresis 2627loops and wake-up can neither be predicted nor fully understood by the measurement despite 28293031widespread observation in many materials.3–8 Understanding such effects have far-reaching 32implications for piezoelectric sensors and actuators,4,9–11 infrared detectors and energy 3334harvesters,12–14 and particularly for emerging ferroelectric memory technologies,15–17 where the 3536fluorite structure HfO2-based ferroelectrics have demonstrated CMOS compatibility and 373839scalability down to several nanometers in thickness.184041The ambiguity over the interpretation of pinched hysteresis characteristics and wake-up has 4243reached its crescendo in the recently discovered ferroelectric hafnium oxide material system.6,19,2044454647The simultaneous coexistence of the monoclinic (paraelectric), tetragonal (paraelectric), and 48orthorhombic (ferroelectric) phases and their respective phase transitions (i.e. monoclinic (m) 4950tetragonal (t), tetragonal (t) orthorhombic (o)) have generated several competing microscopic 51525354theories. Pinching of the hysteresis loop has been found to depend on the composition and dopant 55ACS Paragon Plus Environment56575859602Page 3 of 521 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60ACS Applied Electronic Materialstype where antiferroelectric-like behaviour is hypothesized to originate from a reversible field-induced to phase-transition or defect-induced internal bias fields.19,21 Pristine ferroelectric HfO2 is commonly observed to be pinched initially, but gains more homogeneous switching properties with electric field cycling. This transformation of the ferroelectric loop with cycling has been proposed to be due to a cycling-induced phase transition or domain depinning arising from field-driven redistribution of defects.6,20,22 This so-called wake-up effect, where the remanent polarization increases with electric field excitation, is not unique to ferroelectric hafnium oxide but occurs in other ferroelectric materials such as lead zirconate titanate perovskites where paraelectric to ferroelectric phase transitions cannot explain the enhancement in Pr.4,7 With enough cycling, ferroelectrics usually begin to fatigue and the remanent polarization decays. In the perovskite ferroelectrics, two competing but not mutually exclusive theories of wake-up and fatigue were proposed: (1) The field-driven migration of oxygen vacancies and (2) interfacial charge trapping were both attributed to domain pinning and the loss of switchable polarization.23–25 Despite decades of controversy and indirect evidence supporting both hypotheses of electric field cycling, neither quantitative modelling nor",1218

If the switching polarization were 234to remain constant, as assumed in Figure 5(a),(b), depolarization-induced nucleation inhibition 5678would cause an increase in the coercive field. It may also be possible that the switching polarization 9could decline with greater depolarization when the linear series capacitance decreases, in which 1011case the coercive field increase could be prevented. Nonetheless, unlike the second-order 1213ferroelectric which must decrease its polarization or become completely paraelectric to minimize 141516its free energy around the transition, the first-order ferroelectric has the ability to use back-1718switching as an energy-lowering mechanism such that higher polarization energy minima are 1920capable of being established with an applied electric field despite the material being pushed beyond 21222324its transition point.

H2O was used as the oxidizer to grow HfO2 while O2 plasma was used for the SiO2 growth, in accordance with previous studies.56 10 nm thick TiN top electrodes were sputtered at room temperature using a Bestec PVD tool. After metallization, the 5.4 nm thick Si-doped films were annealed at 800 °C for 20 s in N2 while the 10 nm thick Si-doped HfO2 thin films were annealed at 650 °C for 600 s in N2. The lower temperature anneal was chosen to stabilize antiferroelectric-like behavior in 10 nm thick films. Lower annealing temperatures have been shown in previous reports of Si-doped HfO2 thin films to stabilize antiferroelectric-like hysteresis loops.57 A 10 nm Ti adhesion layer followed by 50 nm of Pt was evaporated through a shadow mask to form the top contacts.

Deconvolution of the tetragonal and 1011orthorhombic peaks was performed by Gaussian fitting where the respective 2θ peak positions 1213were set at 30.8 ° and 30.4 °.

The antiferroelectric switching process can be understood to be caused by depolarization through careful consideration of the hysteresis properties. When the applied electric field is zero at the beginning of the measurement, the ferroelectric polarization is also roughly zero (Ed ≈ 0). When the applied electric field exceeds the coercive field, polarization switching commences and a depolarization field is created which is opposite in direction to the applied field. As the applied ACS Paragon Plus Environment231ACS Applied Electronic MaterialsPage 24 of 52electric field is then ramped back to smaller applied field strengths, the depolarization field exceeds 234the opposite coercive field causing back-switching. The field in the (anti)ferroelectric during the 5678hysteresis measurement is illustrated in Figure 7, where the coercive field is exceeded in every 9quadrant – resulting in polarization switching and subsequent back-switching. Hence, a field-1011induced first-order phase transition can be driven by depolarization fields in ferroelectric hafnium 1213and zirconium oxide thin films. The electric field in Figure 7 is a macroscopic parameter 141516representing the electric field over the entire ferroelectric crystal and can be interpreted as the 1718averaged, collective response of all actively switching ferroelectric domains.

Pinned domains have traditionally been associated with both wake-up and imprint in perovskite ferroelectrics. Pinned domains do not switch due to charged defects, an in-plane polarization orientation, and/or an unfavourable local electric field.4,23,29 Since pinned domains do not switch but still contribute to the overall dielectric displacement current, we can incorporate the influence of pinning by modifying Eq. (1) to 𝑃 = 𝑃𝑑 + (1 ― 𝛽)𝑃𝐹𝐸 = 𝜀0𝜀𝐹𝐸𝐸𝑎𝑝𝑝 + (1 ― 𝛽)𝑃𝐹𝐸, (22) where β is the fraction of pinned ferroelectric domains. Thus, the increase in polarization with electric field cycling can be quantified by domain depinning. A conventional ferroelectric domain depinning process is shown in Figure 8.Figure 8.

Thus, the coexistence of a large enough proportion of the paraelectric tetragonal phase with the polar orthorhombic phase was demonstrated to be able to generate antiferroelectric behavior in HfO2 and ZrO2 based thin films based upon the assumption that both materials obey a first-order phase transition. Depolarization induced nucleation inhibition was postulated to account for the delayed initiation of polarization switching when the depolarization field exceeds the coercive field of the first-order ferroelectric.

This depolarization field 141516can be related to the internal bias fields extracted from FORC measurements. The reduction in 1718depolarization was modelled as an effective thickness reduction of the interfacial dead layer due 1920to an increase in the interfacial trap density with cumulative voltage stressing, though other 21222324microscopic mechanisms such as a phase transition brought about by defect redistribution and/or 25charge accumulation between polar and nonpolar interfaces remain as testable hypotheses for the 2627depolarization models presented in this work. Domain depinning was shown to increase the 28293031switching polarization as the ferroelectric film underwent electric field cycling and could be 32attributed to the overall reduction in depolarization.3334The striking similarities of pre-cycled ferroelectric HfO2 and ZrO2 based capacitors which show 3536strong wake-up effects and their antiferroelectric counterparts are no coincidence, both effects can 373839be driven by a single phenomenon – depolarization.

kim2018.docx,results,". The HZO films show that the Ec needed to reverse the polarization is almost constant regardless of the film thickness, unlike the increase in Ec as the thickness of the conventional PZT decreases.5,21This thickness-independent result was similarly reported in previous studies.5,22,23When the film thickness was less than 6 nm, the Ec of the HZO film was even slightly decreased (i.e., completely opposite to that observed in the perovskite FE PZT).22As the HZO film thickness decreases, Vsat also decreases along with the coer-cive voltage. Consequently, by reducing the HZO film thick-ness, it is expected that the low-voltage operation of the HZO-based FRAM devices can be realized without losing the FE behavior. In fact, Ec can decrease with the decreasing film thickness in extremely thin films due to the depolariza-tion field across the FE layer, which can make the operating voltage even lower.21,22Based on these inherent characteris-tics of the HZO films, most of the previous research hasfocused on the scaling down to achieve lower operating voltage. However, since the crystallization temperature gen-erally increases as the film thickness decreases, the thin HZO film (<7 nm) requires a relatively high temperature anneal-ing process (600�C or higher) to achieve the appropriate FE properties.22,24This high thermal budget process not only precludes the integration of HZO-based FE circuits in the BEOL to increase the effective memory area and add more functionality but also leads to increased leakage. In addition, as the film thickness decreases, the FE polarization decreases due to the smaller grain size or the dead layer effect at the electrode interface.5,21,22Here, stress-induced crystallization using the room-temperature deposited TiN top electrode was employed to overcome such limitations in the 5-nm-thick HZO film.4The TiN top electrode acts as a tensile stressor on the HZO film during the annealing process to form the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase (o-phase, space group: Pca21) that generates a large FE polarization while maintaining a low thermal budget (<450�C).Figure 2(a) shows the P-E hysteresis and pulse write/ read",502

For the 5-nm-thick HZO-based capacitor annealed at 450�C, the extracted remnant polarization (Pr) was approximately 10 lC/cm2 (i.e., 2Pr of about 20 lC/cm2) and saturated when the operat-ing voltage was 1.0 V or higher [Fig. 3(a)]. In addition, this 2Pr remains constant regardless of the second annealing pro-cess conditions (second annealing temperature and time), but the HZO samples annealed again at or above 550�C tend to exhibit relatively high leakage current properties (data not shown). Since the FE switching effect is minimized in the saturation region (>1.0 V), the dielectric constant can also be extracted from the slope of the P-V hysteresis curve in this region (as indicated by the gray scale).5,25The dielectric constant was about 47, which is almost the same value as the previously reported HZO films extracted from the con-ventional small signal capacitance-voltage measurementFIG. 2.

kim2018.docx,results,"of HZO-based capacitors can be divided into three states: wake-up, stabili-zation, and fatigue. Due to the redistribution of existing defects such as oxygen vacancies,4,262Pr increases with the opening of the pinched hysteresis loop (i.e., pristine state) according to the cycles. After wake-up field cycling, 2Pr remains steady and stable. However, as the number of cycles increases, the existing or newly generating defects could result in charge trapping and domain pinning, thereby lead-ing to degradation of the FE properties (i.e., the reduction of 2Pr).9,11,26Since the 5-nm-thick HZO film has a low operat-ing voltage for sufficient switching of the FE polarization, robust endurance properties up to 1010cycles were achieved at a switching voltage of 1.2 V. The number of cycles for the breakdown decreased with increasing switching voltage:�108cycles for 1.3 V. It is to be noted that these endurance levels of the HZO film are superior to those of the previously reported doped HfO2 films despite the fact that films were also scaled down to 5 nm.8–11 Figure 4 shows the crystal structure of the 5-nm-thick HZO film annealed at 400�C and then at 450�C (secondFIG. 4.

Meanwhile, increasing the HZO film thickness or annealing temperature can result in the formation of the monoclinic phase (m-phase, space group: P21/c).4,5Importantly, the m-phase can work as a dead layer in the FE HZO film and thus degrade both the FE and endurance properties.4,9Consequently, the inhibition of m-phase formation during the annealing process is essential to obtain the robust endurance properties of the HZO film.

kim2018.docx,conclusion,", unlike the conventional PZT FE material, the HZO film exhibited almost constant Ec (approximately 1 MV/cm) regardless of the film thickness.. Therefore, by reducing the HZO film thickness to 5 nm, low-voltage (1.0 V) was found to be sufficient to saturate the FE polariza-tion, which led to excellent endurance properties over 1010 switching cycles at 1.2 V. The stress-induced crystallization used in this study allows the HZO film to have desirable FE characteristics by forming the o-phase even at a thickness of 5 nm, which is formed at a low temperature (450�C) compat-ible with BEOL integration.. In addition, this integration scheme can inhibit the m-phase formation which degrades FE and endurance properties during HZO crystallization.. Therefore, we conclude that the low thermal budget 5-nm-thick HZO-based capacitors showing low-voltage operation and high endurance have enormous potential for next-generation FRAM applications..

Because the FE orthorhombic phase (OFE-phase, Pca21) is not the ther-modynamically stable bulk phase21,22, it could be achieved by kinetic means, supplemented by the surface energy/stress effects in the fine-grained (~10 nm) polycrystalline thin films17,23. This phase formation could be enabled by a specific kinetic phase transition from the amorphous as-deposited ALD material during post-deposition annealing (PDA)24–26. The typical thickness of the HZO film with the highest remanent polarization (Pr) was ~10 nm, but a slightly greater thickness (15 nm) was used in this work to ease the STEM characterization.Figure 1a shows the cross-section of the pristine (before elec-trical cycling) TiN/HZO/TiN structure, which was observed by STEM in the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) mode. In the figure, one of the grains in the HZO film that penetrates through the entire film thickness was identified. The bright contrast region corresponds to the Hf and Zr ionic columns, which confirmed that the grain’s crystal structure is O-phase. However, the different space groups (SGs) among the various O phases cannot be identified by recognition of heavy Hf/Zr ions alone. In particular, identification of the OFE-phase Pca21 (SG: 29) and the antipolar OAFE-phase Pbca (SG: 61) is an advantage of the STEM-ABF technique, which has a high sensitivity to light elements, i.e., oxygen ions. Zooming in to the dashed green square area in Fig. 1a in STEM-ABF mode allowed the oxygen ion positions to be determined clearly, as shown in Fig. 1b. Using the shifts in the oxygen ion positions from the centers of the four nearest Hf/Zr ion positions, the oxygen ions can be divided into OI-type (navy blue, at the centrosymmetric position) and OII-type (cyan, at the off-center position). Here, for ease of comparison of the two crystal structures, the polar OFE-phase was identified asFig. 1 The observation of oxygen atoms of single orthorhombic (O-) phase grain in pristine TiN/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO, 15 nm)/TiN device. a Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image of the TiN/HZO/TiN cross-section. b Annular bright-field (ABF)image extracted from the green square area in a, in which the position of the O atomic columns can be clearly detected with different offset and direction.According to the O atomic columns deviated from the center of the four nearest Hf/Zr columns, it can be divided into OI type (center) and OII type (off-center).

There are two shift directions for the OII-type ions: along the [001] direction (green arrows; majority of OII ions) and along the ½00�1�direction (purple arrow; minority of OII ions). Note that atomic-resolution TEM images show the projected positions of atoms along the beam direction (in this case, the [010] O-phase direc-tion). If mixtures of OI and OII positions were present along this direction, there could hardly be a clear distinction between the OI and OII positions in the STEM-ABF image, but this was not the case (see the enlarged images in the insets). Therefore, there are two types of crystal region: one with all OII ions shifting along the [001] direction (green arrows) and another with OII ions shifting alternatingly along the [001] and ½00�1� directions (purple and green arrows, respectively), which can be identified more clearly in the enlarged insert images from Fig. 1b.

It is commonly believed that the hafnia-based ferroelectric capacitors undergo a wake-up-fatigue-breakdown trend under continuous switching cycles.. Figure 2a shows the variations in 2Pr and the leakage currents of a TiN/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (15 nm)/TiN capacitor with increasing numbers of switching cycles (bipolar voltage pulses of ±5 V at f = 500 kHz).. The 2Pr was measured by±3 V P–V loop, and the leakage current was measured at 2 V. During the first 104cycles, wake-up occurs, and the leakage current remains almost constant.. During subsequent cycling up to ~107cycles, the samples showed gradual fatigue (with 2Pr decreasing from ~20.7 to 13.7 μC/cm2) and a simultaneous increase in the leakage current by more than 50 times.. The sample broke down completely after 108cycles.. The field-dependent wake-up process was shown in Supplementary Fig.. S2 (for the 15 nm Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film), where all 2Pr values were measured using a ±3 V P–V loop after each decade of cycles.. At low voltages (<3.2 V), no obvious wake-up was observed, but the 2Pr value decreased monotonically with increasing numbers of switching cycles.. However, at Va > 3.6 V, wake-up was clearly observed..

To answer this question, DFT was used to simulate the switching path from the Pbca global minimum energy phase to the Pbc21 local minimum energy phase. Details of the calculations are included in SM (Supplementary Fig. S10).

Under the application of a negative Eapp (more precisely, Eeff), the −Ps and +Ps (saturation polarization) states of the Pbc21 phase become more unstable and stable, respectively, while the nonpolar phase energy remainedunchanged. When Eeff > E0, the Pbc21 phase becomes energeti-cally more favorable than the Pbca phase; this is summarized inFig. 5b. The calculations showed that E0 is ~0.8 MV/cm, i.e., when Eeff is lower or higher than 0.8 MV/cm, the OAFE Pbca phase or the OFE Pbc21 phase becomes stable, respectively.

The corresponding STEM-ABF image along the [010] direction in Supplementary Fig. S12b clearly shows the alternating distributions of the OII ion positions being shifted along the [001] (green) and ½00�1� (purple) directions. This finding demonstrates that high-Va fatigue was also induced by the transition from the OFE Pbc21 phase to the OAFE Pbca phase. Another notable finding from this sample is the development of a fairly thick interfacial T-phase, which can be seen in Supple-mentary Fig. S12a. The STEM-HAADF images of this high-field fatigued sample confirmed that the thickness of this layer was ~3.25–4.25 nm. The last row of Table 1 indicates that Eeff across the remaining ~11.75–10.75 nm-thick OFE-phase is as low as 0.29–0.55 MV/cm for Va = 4 V under these circumstances because of the severe depolarizing field effect. These calculation",421
s41467-022-28236-5.docx,results,"thus corroborated the finding that high-Va fatigue is induced by the transition from the Pbc21 phase to the Pbca phase and not by defect generation and the accompanying domain pinning.Following the same line of reasoning used for rejuvenation of the low-Va fatigued sample shown in Fig. 2f, a similar rejuvena-tion was attempted using Va = 5.5 V that increased Eeff to ~0.84–1.09 MV/cm, as also shown in Table 1. Supplementary Fig. S13b shows the evolution of the P–V curve with increasing rejuvenation cycling numbers up to 104. As expected, the fatigued sample is partly recovered. This is further strong evidence that the high-Va fatigue was also induced by the phase transition mentioned above.Similar electrical and structural characterizations were per-formed for the 5.6-nm-thick HZO film to prove the general applicability of the reversible phase transition model for the thinner films. The",206
s41467-022-28236-5.docx,results,"are summarized in Supplementary Figs. S14–S21. Although the thinner film contained a higher portion of T-phase grains in the pristine state, in addition to the O-phase grains, it showed similar wake-up, fatigue, and rejuve-nation processes. Therefore, it can be inferred that the reversible transition between the nonpolar Pbca phase and polar Pbc21 phase also occurs in the 5.6-nm-thick HZO film. The only dif-ference is that the wake-up process in this thinner film is also contributed by the structural transition from the P42/nmc T-phase to Pca21 O-phase.The knowledge acquired based on the effects of the VO con-centration on the phase stability indicates that the increase in the interfacial T-phase thickness is reasonable; it has been reported previously that the highest VO concentration stabilizes the T-phase over the O- and monoclinic (M)-phases28,30. It must then be reasonable to believe that the repeated electrical stimuli enhanced the chemical interactions between the HZO film and the reactive TiN electrode, which would also increase the VO concentration. It was also noted that these interfacial T-phases were mostly found around the top electrode interface. The bot-tom electrode interface was formed by depositing an HZO film on the TiN layer, which may produce a stable interface structure31. However, the top electrode interface was formed by depositing the TiN layer on the HZO film using a reactive sputtering process, which must have had a damaging effect on the HZO layer surface. Therefore, the top surface of the HZO layer must be vulnerable to oxygen concentration losses during electrical cycling tests.",365

s41467-022-28236-5.docx,results,"showed that the 180° domain boundary structure of the OFE Pbc21 phaseis identical to the crystal structure of the OAFE Pbca phase, which is consistent with a previous theoretical expectation18. This structural relationship and the only slightly different energies of the two phases make the reversible phase change produced by the application of an electric field with a controlled magnitude fea-sible. The critical electric field for this transition was estimated to be ~0.8 MV/cm using DFT calculations.The wake-up phenomenon could be induced by applying a voltage that exerted a switching field across the OFE layer that was higher than the critical field. The interfacial T-phase grew as the number of switching cycles increased to the degree that was also dependent on the applied voltage. This interfacial T-phase gen-erated a depolarizing field, which reduced the effective field applied to the remaining OFE phase film. As the interfacial T-phase evolves in tandem with the increasing numbers of cycles, the effective field then becomes lower than the critical field, even at the given applied voltage; this is accompanied by the transition from wake-up to fatigue. However, because the fatigue in this material was not induced by irreversible defect generation and domain pinning but instead was induced by a (reversible) phase transition between the polar and antipolar phases, the fatigued sample could then be rejuvenated by applying a voltage that increased the effective field to exceed the critical field. This degradation mechanism for the ferroelectric performance of the HZO film is critically different from that of conventional perovskite-based FE thin films. A similar model can be applied to other fluorite-structured FE thin films, including variously doped HfO2 films.While the oxygen loss caused by the repeated electrical stimuli was the fundamental origin of the performance degradation, it did not affect the phase stability and FE performance of the OFE phase film directly. Instead, the evolution of the interfacial T-phase caused the depolarization field effect over the remaining OFE phase-based portion, which then promoted the transition to the ground state OAFE phase. Therefore, preventing oxygen loss during repeated electrical operations remains the most crucial factor in achieving the ultimate performance levels when using these newly established FE films.Methods Device fabrication. The TiN/HZO/TiN capacitor fabrication processes were as follows. First, the TiN bottom electrodes were deposited on the SiO2/Si substrate by ion beam sputtering. Then, 10–15-nm-thick HZO thin films were deposited by ALD at 280 °C. Hf[N(C2H5)CH3]4, Zr[N(C2H5)CH3]4, and H2O were used as the Hf precursor, the Zr precursor, and the oxygen source, respectively. The Hf:Zr ratio was controlled by alternating deposition of one cycle of HfO2 and one cycle of ZrO2. Also, 10-nm-thick nanolaminated HfO2/ZrO2 film, where each layer’s thickness was 1 nm, was prepared. Subsequently, the top electrode (TiN) layer was sputtered and patterned into different sizes. Finally, the as-fabricated TiN/HZO/ TiN ferroelectric capacitors were annealed for 30 s at 500 °C in a nitrogen atmo-sphere to crystallize the HZO.Electrical measurements.

Suman_Kai_HZO_highK_IEDM_2019.docx,Abstract,—We demonstrate a novel strategy to scaling the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of MOSFETs by tuning the composition of Hf1-xZrxO2 thin-film near morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between orthorhombic ferroelectric phase and tetragonal anti-ferroelectric phase. This approach can avoid the shortcomings of mobility and reliability degradation incurred in interlayer (IL) scaling approach and gate leakage increase from band gap reduction in traditional higher κ materials. Through comprehensive theoretical modeling and,109

Suman_Kai_HZO_highK_IEDM_2019.docx,INTRODUCTION,"The relentless scaling of CMOS technology has left almost no space for further reduction of the physical thickness of gate dielectric, without incurring penalties of excessive gate leakage current. However, the thinner equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) gate dielectric has been persistently requested for high-κ metal gate (HKMG) high-performance transistors, because it can enable improved electrostatics, higher drive current, and lower gate leakage (Fig.1 (b) and (c)). To that end, generally two approaches exist to further reducing EOT. One is to decrease the equivalent interlayer thickness through either scavenging of the interlayer or increase its permittivity by forming metal silicate [1]. However, that comes with severe degradation in both carrier mobility and reliability due to closer proximity of the channel to the high-κ dielectric [2]. Therefore, it is preferred to take the other approach by pursuing higher-κ dielectrics. It is generally known that the dielectric band gap inversely depends on the dielectric constant (Eg~ κ-0 65) [2]. Therefore, the κ value has been limited to 20-30 to avoid the excessive direct tunneling current in higher κ material, which has lower band gap. To further boost the κ value, strategies without degrading the bandgap are highly desired. In this paper, we propose to design Hf1-xZrxO2 high-κ dielectric near the MPB between the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase (x<0.7) and tetragonal anti-ferroelectric phase (x>0.7). MPB is known as a transition region in the compositional phase diagram, where the crystal structure changes [3][4]. It has been shown that materials exhibit maximum piezoelectric [3] and dielectric response [4] near the MPB, and thus of great interest for applications such as actuators and sensors. The response to external stimuli is significant near the MPB, since several phases (different phases have different charge response, like dielectric, ferroelectric, and anti-ferroelectric) co-exist and there is nearly no energy barrier separating different phases. As a result, a slight mechanical or electrical perturbation could induce a significant response in charge. Therefore, it provides an alternative approach to boost κ if the dielectric can be engineered near the MPB. Zr doped HfO2 has triggered significant interest for its application as ferroelectric memory [5] and negative capacitance logic transistor [6]. In this material system, it exhibits MPB in its compositional phase diagram (Fig.2). On the one end (x = 0), it is monoclinic, and hence purely dielectric; while, on the other end (x = 1), it is tetragonal and purely anti-ferroelectric. In between, it exhibits an orthorhombic ferroelectric phase. Therefore, in this work, we demonstrate that κ exhibits a peak near MPB (x ~ 0.7 with κ = 38) in Hf1-xZrxO2. We employ a microscopic model to explain the phase evolution and existence of MPB in Hf1-xZrxO2 and perform a systematic",699

II.MICROSCOPIC MODELING OF MPB IN HZO The increase of Zr concentration in Hf1-xZrxO2 modulates the internal strain applied to the system by stretching the Hf-O and Zr-O bonds. The transformation from monoclinic to orthorhombic phase is induced by the increasing gliding strain tensor with the Zr ratio [7]. As a result, the polarization within a single sublattice becomes uniform (ferroelectric), instead of canceling each other (dielectric). In this work, we mainly focus on the phase transformation from orthorhombic to tetragonal as it is the MPB that is of interest for high-κ. With the increasing Zr ratio, the bonds between two sublattices are under compressive stress, which leads to an unfavorable increase in the dipole-dipole interaction energy, causing phase change from orthorhombic to tetragonal by flipping the polarization in one sublattice (Fig.3), though at the cost of elastic energy [8]. To capture the aforementioned physical mechanisms for phase transformation, we model a system composed of two sublattices and express the total energy (Utot) as a sum of energy local to each sublattice (Ulocal ) and the interaction energy 978-1-7281-4032-2/19/$31.00 ©2019 IEEE7.4 .1IEDM19-150Authorized licensed use limited to: Georgia Institute of Technology.

The interaction energy includes the dipole-dipole interaction energy (Up-p ), which favors anti-parallel polarization between the two sublattices when under compression and the elastic energy due to bond stretch (Ubond). All the relevant expressions and parameters are listed in Fig.3. This framework elegantly captures the phase evolution with the increase of Zr concentration by comparing the predicted QFE-VFE hysteresis loops and the",504
Suman_Kai_HZO_highK_IEDM_2019.docx,experiment,"ally measured ones (Fig.4). The total system energy contour on the sublattice polarization (P1, P2) plane clearly exhibits phase transformation, as shown in Fig.5. The orthorhombic ferroelectric phase is favored if the energy minimum lies on the anti-diagonal line, where the sublattice polarization equals each other (P1=P2). On the other hand, if the energy minimum lies on the diagonal line, where the sublattice polarization is opposite to each other (P1 = -P2), the tetragonal anti-ferroelectric phase is energetically favorable. For 70% Zr concentration, it can be clearly seen that the total energy is minimum along both the diagonal and anti-diagonal directions, indicating co-existence of both ferroelectric and anti-ferroelectric phases. The disappear of energy barrier separating the two phases (Fig.6(c)) indicating the MPB around this concentration. As shown in Fig.6(b), this transformation occurred because the compression significantly increases the dipole-dipole interaction energy through its coefficient, and hence favors anti-parallel alignment between the polarizations in the two sublattices. We also extracted κ value for various Zr concentration from",291
Suman_Kai_HZO_highK_IEDM_2019.docx,EXPERIMENT,"AL VERIFICATION OF MAXIMUM K NEAR MPB To verify that κ is maximum near the MPB in a practical Si transistor, we fabricated multiple MOS capacitors with different thicknesses for different Zr concentration. The process starts with surface preparation and growth of 8 Å SiO2 interlayer (Fig.7(a-c)). Then the Hf1-xZrxO2 gate dielectrics are deposited via ALD, followed by tungsten (W) electrode sputtering. All the samples receive a 600 °C spike anneal to crystallize the film. Figs.7(d) and (e) show the measured CMOS-VG frequency dispersion characteristics at different Zr concentrations for 7.5nm and 2.5nm oxide sample, respectively. It is clearly seen that the accumulation capacitance exhibits a maximum around 70% Zr, irrespectively of the oxide thickness. MOS capacitors of different oxide thicknesses are measured and their capacitance equivalent thickness (CET) values are linearly fitted as a function of physical thickness (Fig.8(a)). The CET is extracted from the measured capacitance data at a constant semiconductor charge (QMOS=2 μC/cm2). From the slope, the κ value can be extracted as a function of Zr concentration (Fig.8(b)). Clearly, it exhibits a peak around the MPB, similar to Fig.6(a). Therefore, we can further boost the κ value through this engineering approach. The interface trap (Dit) energy distribution profile is also extracted using conductance method (inset of Fig.9(a)) for different Zr concentration samples (Fig.9(a) and (b)). It suggests that 70% Zr sample marginally affect the Dit only towards the bottom half of the bandgap, while improve the Dit in the upper half of the bandgap compared with the best HfO2 sample.

Suman_Kai_HZO_highK_IEDM_2019.docx,CONCLUSION,"S In summary, we have demonstrated a new approach to design a higher κ gate dielectric by utilizing the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) that exists in the compositional phase diagram of Hf1-xZrxO2. It relies on the effect that different phases with distinct charge characteristics (ferroelectric and anti-ferroelectric) co-exist at the phase boundary such that a small external perturbation gets amplified to a large charge response through phase transformation. The morphotropic phase boundary exists in Hf1-xZrxO2 system due to the phase transition between the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase and the tetragonal anti-ferroelectric phase. This transformation is induced as the system attempts to minimize the dipole-dipole interaction energy, which becomes dominant due to the compressive strain introduced with additional Zr. A maximum κ value of 38 is demonstrated at the phase boundary and can improve the electrostatics and boost drive current by 13% in advanced technology nodes. Therefore, this approach emerges as a promising candidate to engineer extremely thin EOT gate dielectric for future HKMG transistors.",240

V C 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4867975]The recent discovery of ferroelectricity (FE) in HfO2 (and ZrO2)-based high-j materials has spurred renewed in-terest in ferroelectric memory devices. Compared to typi-cal (layered) perovskite ferroelectrics used in commercial ferroelectric random access memory (FE-RAM) such as PbZrxTi(1�x)O3 and SrBi2Ta2O9, FE high-j material films can be much thinner (<10 nm). They are also compatible with CMOS standard processing conditions and do not require to be crystallized in an oxygen ambient at high temperature. Moreover, standard TiN was used instead of the more special electrode materials as Pt, Ir(Ox), or Ru(Ox). This does not only open the door for further (DRAM-like) scaling of FE capacitor based FE-RAM but also enables the fabrication of FE field effect transistor (FE-FET) based memory, combining the performance and the established reliability of FE-RAM with a small NAND-Flash cell.1 However, in contrast to the classical ferroelectrics, a detailed understanding of the ferroelectric polarization rever-sal phenomenon in Hf-based films is still lacking. Also, the maximum values of the attainable polarization and of the switching fields are still unknown. We aim at filling this gap by providing more insight by using first principles calcula-tions as this information is crucial to guide further material optimization.To understand the relationship between the atomic struc-ture and the polarization reversal mechanism occurring in FE o-HfO2, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the local density approximation (LDA) formalism with the Quantum ESPRESSO package2and ultrasoft pseudopotentials. A kinetic energy cut-off of 540 eV has been used to truncate the planewave expansion and the Brillouin zone has been sampled with an 8 � 8 � 8 grid. The polarization of bulk systems has been calculated using the Berry phase approach,3–5 integrated over 16 k-point strings, each one containing eight k-points. The computations were performed without an explicit spin–orbit coupling. Finally, the barrier height associated with the fer-roelectric distortion has been evaluated by a nudged elastic band (NEB) approach using a climbing image algorithm,6inwhich a chain of ten images coupled with a spring constant of 5 eV have been minimized.HfO2 is polymorphic and can adopt a series of crystalline phases: monoclinic (P21/c), cubic (Pa3, Fm3m), tetragonal (P42/nmc), or an orthorhombic one (Pnma, Pbca, and closely related Pbc21).7The most stable one is the monoclinic phase, followed by the orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic ones. However, only the orthorhombic phase (Pbc21, henceforth denoted o-HfO2) is non-centrosymmetric, from which the FE originates.",724

On the other hands, potential energy barriers are very sensitive to the convergence of the electronic density. Small deviations in the structure are there-fore expected to have large computation errors. The antici-pated changes do not change the resulting qualitative picture.In contrast to perovskite FE materials, where there is a clear symmetry relation driving the atomic FE distortion, there is no obvious way to predict the local atomic arrange-ments responsible for the spontaneous polarization in the FE o-HfO2 phase. Ab initio simulations are indispensable to identify the two structural minima at the origin of the FE dis-tortion. We hence proceeded as follows: starting with the accepted picture11that the four O atoms present in the unit cell have to move out of their equilibrium position, going0003-6951/2014/104(9)/092906/4/$30.00104, 092906-1V C 2014 AIP Publishing LLC092906-2Clima et al.Appl.

The double well potential that defines the polarization reversal energy barrier (Ea) can be fitted well to a fourth order polynomial (consistent with the Landau–Ginzburg second order phase transition formalism12), as shown in Figure 1. It is interesting to note that the computed value is about twice the highest experi-mental one of the remanent polarization (Pr), observed for Y-doped HfO2 (24–25 lC/cm2).13Take note that the experi-mental remanent polarization is by definition smaller than the theoretical (saturation/spontaneous) one due to polycrys-tallinity and FE domains misalignment. Indeed, the X-ray diffraction measurements shows that the FE HfO2 films are randomly oriented polycrystals without any signs of tex-ture.13In this case, the Pr is the integrated projection of the polarization on the field direction over a half of the sphere and amounts to1=2Ps.

In practice, the domain walls dynamics will reduce the coercive field to much lower values due to the grain sizes.15An additional possible source of devi-ation is the presence of a strain gradient to which the depos-ited film is subject due the processing conditions. Since the first principles investigations of the domain wall dynamics is not a viable option, we studied only the influence of the strain on the polarization reversal barrier. We illustrate the impact of 1% biaxial strain on the in-plane (polarization direction c ¼ [001]) and out-of-plane cell parameters (perpendicular to the polarization axis (110)) for both tensile and compressive strain in Figure 2. A compressive strain tends to decrease the barrier height, while a tensile one increases it with the volume of the unit cell. The distortions induced by the strain (and hence the Hf-O bonds responsible for the FE) are not paralle-l/orthogonal to the plane of the applied deformation, as it is the case in the perovskites. Therefore, the dependence is more complex, as illustrated by the permutation of the two smallest cell parameters in Figures 2(a) and 2(b) and thein-plane/out-of-planestraineffectsinFigure2(c).Interestingly, this points towards the fact that it should be possible to tune the width of the hysteresis loop of the FE response using an engineered external source of stress.Synthesizing the metastable o-HfO2 film proves not to be straight forward, requiring doping and/or stress/capping092906-3Clima et al.Appl.

The deformation induced by presence of the extrinsic dop-ants leads to a volume dependence similar to the case where the polarization direction is along the shortest unit cell pa-rameter (Figure 2(b) vs Figure 3(a)). If one compares theevolution of the barrier height with the volume in a strained system (Figures 2(a)–2(c)) and the strain from the doped sys-tems (Figure 3(a)), one can conclude that the polarization direction is most probably in the direction of the shortest unit cell parameter. We also observe a consistent correlation of the coercive field and of the barrier height with the unit cell size and the dopant atom radius. The volume dependence can be split into three groups of elements: (Al, Si), (Y, Sr), and (Zr, Gd). Both Ea and Ec show qualitatively the same evolution within its group, i.e., an increase of the dopant ra-dius corresponds to an augmentation of both Ec and Ea (as schematically illustrated by the guiding lines in Figure 3). However, doping o-HfO2 with Zr and Gd leads to an inverted trend for Ec and Ea. We speculate that this difference is due to either some",285

The stabilization of higher symmetric phases in HfO2 (cubic, tetragonal) compared to the monoclinic bulk phase was found earlier to depend on the thermal treatment,9growth temperature,10 surface energy effects11and mechanical encapsulation realized by the electrodes.12Furthermore, doping with various elements leads to the stabilization of a higher symmetric phase as summarized by Mueller et al.4After the first discovery of ferroelectricity in silicon doped hafnium oxide in 2011 by Boescke et al.,1it was shown that ferroelectricity can be induced by several dopants which are also known to stabilize a higher symmetric phase in hafnium oxide (Y,13 Gd,14Al,15Sr,16and La17). Furthermore, a mixture of hafnium and zirconium oxide (HZO) does also stabilize the ferroelectric phase.18 Ferroelectricity was not only observed for layers prepared by atomic layer deposition, but also observed for yttrium doped samplesattributed to an antiferroelectric-like behaviour. Later this behaviour could be explained by a field-induced phase tran-sition from tetragonal to orthorhombic in an applied field.24 Moreover, it was shown in a previous work that there is no significant difference in the suitability to induce ferroelectric properties in HfO2 for different dopants from the lanthanoid group.22 In this work the influence of several dopants with varying ionic radii between 54 pm and 135 pm on the ferroelectric properties is investigated (Mg, Ba, Sr, Y, La, Nd, Sm, Er, Al, Ga, In, Co, and Ni). For a good comparability of all dopants the same type of precursor is used during solution preparation as well as the preparation conditions are the same.

Furthermore, an encapsulation was necessary for336 | J. Mater. Chem. C, 2017, 5, 333--338and smaller (Ni, Mg) dopants, respectively. A very similar pattern is found for the larger and smaller dopants. This is kind of unexpected since it is known that dopants smaller than hafnium preferentially stabilize the tetragonal phase, whereas larger dopants tend to stabilize the cubic phase in hafnium oxide.40–44Although a cubic phase is present for all films, still a difference between smaller and larger dopants can be found. For the smaller dopants the peaks are shifted towards larger 2theta values which indicates smaller lattice constants. This is also expected if a smaller ion is incorporated into the lattice. Furthermore, a small shift of the platinum peaks at 811 and 461 can be observed towards smaller values, which indicates a change in the lattice constants of the platinum electrode. Therefore, it seems that the oxide layer slightly influences the crystal structure of the platinum during crystallization. These small differences in the lattice constants could hinder the transformation from the cubic into ferroelectric orthorhombic phase during wake-up cycling for the smaller dopants.Although the chemical properties within one group (e.g. Mg, Sr, Ba) are similar, the different elements still show some differences e.g. in their electronegativity which could influenceThis journal is ©The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017View Article OnlinePublished on 14 December 2016.

For bulk PbTiO3 constrained in plane to 3.846 A˚ the c axis lattice parameter was found to be 4.009 A˚ with a polariza-tion of 0:73 C=m2. For any choice of np and ns, minimi-zation of Eq.

Kisung_Kummel_Cho_Stability_HZO_JAP_2020.docx,ABSTRACT,"Hafnium–zirconium oxide (HZO) thin films are of interest due to their ability to form ferroelectric (FE) and antiferroelectric (AFE) oxide phases. Density functional theory is employed to elucidate the stabilization mechanisms of both FE HZO thin films and AFE ZrO2 films. The FE orthorhombic phase is primarily stabilized by in-plane tensile strain, which spontaneously occurs during the synthesis process, and this is more effective for HZO than HfO2. Layer-by-layer stack models and core-matrix three-dimensional models of the polymorphs reveal that the electrostatic component of interfacial free energy can play a critical role in the formation of the AFE tetragonal phase in ZrO2 and the “wake-up” effect for FE HZO.Published under license by AIP Publishing. https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0011547I.",214

A number of factors have beensuggested to stabilize the ferroelectricity in HZO thin films such asthe thickness and composition of the film as well as the top/bottomelectrode materials.1,2,6–8Thinner films with a composition close to50% Hf and 50% Zr tend to favor ferroelectricity.6In addition, fer-roelectricity is favored for HZO films grown on specific electrode materials. Titanium nitride (TiN)6,7and tungsten (W)9are well-known to favor the ferroelectricity in HZO while Pt electrodes cannot form ferroelectric HZO films.10In contrast to the inert Pt electrodes, both TiN and W electrodes are known to form strong interfacial bonding with HZO, which is a key factor for inducing ferroelectricity in HZO.While some of these factors are recognized as important by various research groups, most of the theoretical predictions based on DFT calculations argue that compressive strain is responsible for the stabilization of the FE orthorhombic phase over the mono-clinic phase.11,12However,",556

Only a few related DFT calculations can be found recently to take into account the HZO interfaces. For instance, Blaise has demonstrated a metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitor model of TiN/ Si-doped HfO2/TiN in DFT calculations, and quantitatively esti-mated a depolarization field of 2.5 MV/cm,17which agrees withTo impose in-plane strain along different orientations of HZO such as {001}, {011}, and {111}, unit cell rotation is performed to orient one of the cell axes to be perpendicular to the plane of inter-est, which is similar to a previous study.12Isotropic change of the initial rotated cell area is imposed to generate in-plane strain. To model the plane-stress condition, i.e., σzz = 0, the cell parameter along that orientation is set free to relax while the other two cell parameters are fixed at the designated values. The details of the in-plane biaxial strain can be found in the supplementary material.To model HZO in a 1 × 1 × 1 cell containing four HfO2 formula units, two of the metal sites are occupied by Hf, while the other two sites are occupied by Zr. All the possible configurations of HZO alloys are determined to be energetically degenerated within the sub-meV/fu limit for 1 × 1 × 1 cell, and the difference in energy is less than 2 meV/fu for doubled cells. Therefore, the most energetically stable configuration of the ordered HZO alloy is chosen for all the calculations below.III.",474

Crystallization of amorphous HZO on strongly bound electrodes generates tension due to the crystalline phases having a higher density than the amorphous phase. During post-deposition crystallization of amorphous HZO, the resulting tension will favor the formation of FE orthorhombic HZO compared to the high density plane of the monoclinic phase. Second, stack and 3D models show that a polarization perpendicular to the dielectric–fer-roelectric interface has a high interfacial free energy consistent with nanocrystalline ZrO2 spontaneous forming the tetragonal phase and HZO commonly requiring electrical cycling, i.e., a wake-up process, for observation of strong ferroelectric behavior.II.

The plane-wave basis set of wave functions is expanded up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV. The projector augmented wave method is used for the core part.20The exchange-correlation functional of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof is employed.21 For the Brillouin zone sampling, Kohn–Sham energy eigenvalues are integrated into reciprocal space on even grids generated by a Monkhorst–Pack22scheme with a density of 0.25 2πÅ−1. The electronic structure self-consistent field optimization is iterated until changes in each of the eigenvalues and the total energy are less than 10−4meV. Atomic positions and lattice parameters are optimized by the conjugate gradient method until the Hellmann–Feynman forces acting on each atom became smallera cubic parent phase (fluorite), all the polymorphs show similar atomic arrangements; the metal ions (Hf/Zr) form a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice framework with the O atoms occupying all eight tetrahedral sites of the FCC lattice. Each of the O atoms is displaced from the cubic symmetric positions (i.e., the center of the tetrahedral site), and the polymorphs are identified by the specific arrangements of the displaced O atoms as shown in Fig. 1(a). Note that the Pca21 phase (ortho FE) represents a non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric phase with spontaneous dipoles as marked by blue arrows in Fig. 1(a). However, the ortho FE phase is a metastable phase in the pure bulk state with its formation energy higher by 60–79 meV/fu (ZrO2 to HfO2) than the ground state P21/c phase (mono) as seen in Fig. 1(b). The Pbca phase (ortho AFE) shows a similar atomic arrangement as the ortho FE but the displacements of O atoms are switched in every other unit cell of the ortho FE to form a centrosymmetric phase.Figure 1(b) shows that the tetragonal P42/nmc phase (tetra AFE) is 65–93 meV/fu (ZrO2 to HfO2) higher in energy than the ortho FE in static DFT calculations (i.e., at 0 K) but it is known that the tetra AFE is the ground state at relatively high tempera-ture,23indicating that the difference in entropic contribution from phonons plays a role.

It has been previ-ously shown that FE HZO films sandwiched by TiN electrodes after annealing are under tension.13Therefore, identifying the distinct planes with different densities and taking into account the strong bond formation at the interfaces play a crucial role to explain properly the hypothesis that in-plane tension generated during the post-deposition annealing might stabilize the ortho FE phase.Figure 2 shows the energy of HZO polymorphs with varying compositions (i.e., HfO2, Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, and ZrO2) with in-plane strain perpendicular to the {111} orientation which is the preferred growth direction when HZO is deposited on TiN or W.1,2,25,26 Here, only the high density plane of the monoclinic (“mono”)phase, or (11�1), is shown since it should be preferred on reactive electrodes and since it is observed",336

Furthermore, the required amount of in-plane tensile strain to stabilize the ortho FE over the ortho AFE ranges 3.2%–3.8% for {011} which is even smaller than the case of {111} (5.3%–5.5%). This indicates that the amount of field cycling, or“wake-up,” process can be avoided/reduced for the {011} growth inBased on a kinetic model proposed previously,26the tetra AFE phase forms first during the thermal annealing and is subsequently transformed into the ortho FE phase. Using the internal energy change (ΔU = Etetra – Eortho) and the interfacial free energies (ES) obtained from the stack models as shown in Fig. 4(e), the energy of ortho–tetra phase transition within a 3D cubic matrix (ΔE) is estimated as a function of the orthorhombic nanocrystal size (m) which is depicted in Fig. 4(f),contrast to the {111} case.ΔE(m) ¼ V(m)ΔU(m) þXAS(m)ES,In contrast to {111} and {011}, the HZO films along {001}cannot be stabilized either by mechanical strain or epitaxial growthsince the energy curve for the monoclinic phase shows a lowerenergy compared to the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase over a wide range of strains as seen in Fig. S2 in the supplementary material. However, Shimizu et al. have grown an epitaxial film of (001) Y-doped HfO2 on (001) YSZ using PLD and demonstrated that the HfO2 phase progressively changes with substrate Y content from monoclinic to orthorhombic to tetragonal.29As the lattice parameters of Y-doped HfO2 and YSZ are sufficiently close to each other, the tetragonal/orthorhombic phases in these films could be stabilized by doping effects or low interfacial free energy due to matching the substrate crystal structures but a full understanding of this system requires further DFT modeling.To further elucidate the observed FE behavior of HZO and the AFE behavior of nanocrystalline ZrO2 films, stack models with domain boundaries of the tetra and ortho FE phases were con-structed for ZrO2 in Figs. 4(a)–4(d) and other compositions in Fig. S3 in the supplementary material.

The tetragonal phase is strained to have the bulk ortho FE cell dimensions and is rotated simultane-ously with the ortho FE layer so that the interfacial strain is inde-pendent of the dipole orientation. The interface free energy (Einter) is calculated byEinter ¼ (Estack � nEtetra � nEortho)/2A,where Estack is the total energy of the stack. Etetra and Eortho are energies in the bulk state for tetra AFE and ortho FE phases, respectively, with the unit cell volume fixed at ortho FE. The n and A are the tetra/ortho layer thickness and cross-sectional area, respectively. Figure 4(e) shows that the Einter converges with increasing n in all cases. Moreover, the stack with the dipole direc-tion perpendicular to the interface (i.e., along z) shows the highest Einter, which is expected to be due to the electrostatic interactions. This is consistent with the negative capacitance models of Khan et al. showing that perpendicular polarization is destabilized by having a paraelectric in series with ferroelectric HZO.31The field due to the spontaneous polarization in the ortho FE region induces the neighboring dielectric layer to be polarized, which will increase the energy of the system. It is observed that unconstrained stack models spontaneously transform into other phases or change polar-ization directions from perpendicular to parallel to the interface.where the subscript S in the second term represents the different crystallographic orientations of the {100} interfaces, i.e., (100), (�100), (010), (0�10), (001), and (00�1).

Hanrahan_Epitaxial_strain_HZO_111_PRMater_2019.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Ferroelectrics characterized by switchable spontaneous po-larization have long been considered as a candidate material to realize low-power high-speed nonvolatile memories and logic devices [1–3]. However, the difficulty of integrating perovskite ferroelectrics into complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes [4] has hindered device scaling to the sub-100-nm regime [5]. The discovery of ferro-electricity in both pure and doped HfO2 thin films [6–11] have revitalized interest in using ferroelectrics in nanoscale de-vices [12] because HfO2 is a well-studied CMOS-compatible gate dielectric that is thermodynamically stable on silicon [13]. Moreover, contrary to conventional perovskite-based ferroelectric thin films where the depolarization field due to an incomplete screening of surface charges often leads to the instability of out-of-plane polarization [14–16], HfO2-based thin films possess robust electrical polarization at the nanoscale, ideal for device miniaturization [6]. It is suggested that HfO2 may well be a type of ferroelectric material that only exhibits spontaneous polarization at the nanometer length scale but not in the bulk form [17].The observation of ferroelectricity in HfO2 is unexpected, given that this simple binary oxide has been studied ex-tensively for decades as high-κ dielectrics [18]. Bulk HfO2 adopts the monoclinic (M) P21/c phase at room temperature and pressure, transforms to the tetragonal (T) P42/nmc phase and the cubic Fm¯3m phase with increasing temperature, andbecomes the “antiferroelectric-like” orthorhombic (AO) Pbca phase at a higher pressure. All these phases are centrosymmet-ric and thus nonpolar. Böscke et al. first reported the presence of ferroelectricity in thin films of SiO2-doped hafnium oxide with a thickness of 10 nm [6]. Since then, many divalent and trivalent dopants were found to be able to induce ferroelec-tricity in hafnia thin films [7–9,19]. Robust polarization of 10μC/cm2was observed even in dopant-free hafnia thin films in a thickness range of 4-12 nm [20].The origin of ferroelectricity in HfO2-based thin films has attracted intensive studies in recent years. Combined",565
Hanrahan_Epitaxial_strain_HZO_111_PRMater_2019.docx,conclusion,"that the polar orthorhombic (PO) Pca21 phase is most likely responsible for the ferroelectricity [10,21–24]. Based on density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations, the M phase is the most stable phase, followed by the polar PO phase and the nonpolar T phase [21,22,24]. The stabiliza-tion of the metastable PO phase in thin films is attributed to a variety of extrinsic factors such as finite-size effects and surface/interface effects associated with small grain size [10,20,24–27], strains of different origins [28,29], dopants [9,19,30–32], oxygen vacancies [11,33], and electric fields [29].In the phenomenological surface energy model developed by Materlik et al. that takes into account the surface en-ergy contribution to the phase stability, the hafnia grains of nanometer size (< 4 nm) will favor the ferroelectric phase because of the lower surface energy of the PO phase than that of the M phase [24]. Batra et al. evaluated the sur-face energies of different phases of hafnia with DFT and*liushi@westlake.edu.cn†brendan.m.hanrahan.civ@mail.milfound that the PO phase has lower (001) surface energy but higher (100) and (010) surface energies than those of the2475-9953/2019/3(5)/054404(9)054404-1©2019 American Physical SocietySHI LIU AND BRENDAN M. HANRAHANPHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS 3, 054404 (2019)M phase [25]. They also found that the surface energies of the T phase are consistently lower than the M phase for all surface planes, suggesting a surface-induced formation of the nonpolar T phase at the nanoscale, followed by a transition to the ferroelectric PO phase due to other extrinsic perturbations [25].The epitaxial compressive strain is considered to play an important role in inducing the ferroelectric PO phase [22,29]. However, DFT calculations have shown that neither hydro-static pressure nor biaxial compressive stress alone is enough to make the polar phase the most stable phase. Therefore, the application of external electric fields is required to drive the nonpolar to polar phase transition [29], which may explain the “wake-up effect” in hafnia thin films [9,34,35]. The pres-ence of oxygen vacancies is often detrimental to the device functionality by causing leakage current, aging, and fatigue in ferroelectrics, but is proposed to be beneficial for realizing the ferroelectric PO phase [27].

It appears that the emergence of ferroelectricity in HfO2 thin films is indeed the cumulative effect of various extrinsic factors.. Previous studies on epitaxial strain engineering of ferro-electricity have mostly focused on thin films grown on (00l)-oriented substrates [37].. There is now growing interest in ap-plying biaxial strain along other crystallographic planes such as (101) and (111) by growing thin films on substrates of dif-ferent cuts [38].. The substrate orientation offers an unconven-tional route to tune the mechanical boundary conditions that can substantially affect the phase stability and ferroelectric domain morphologies.. For example, DFT calculations suggest that (111)-oriented BaTiO3 thin films have strain-driven phase transitions drastically different from the (001)-oriented thin films, and (110)-oriented BaTiO3 may support three distinct M phases that are not present in bulk BaTiO3 [39].. Experi-mental works on (111)-oriented PbZrxTi1−xO3 thin films re-vealed a high-density, nanotwinned domain morphology con-sisting of degenerate polarization variants that enable both di-rect 180◦and multistep 90◦switching [40–42].. In this regard, it is important to explore the effect of substrate orientation on the ferroelectric properties of HfO2 [43]..

Moreover, HfO2-based films are often polycrystalline, consisting of grains of different orientations such that only grains with the polar axis along the out-of-plane direction will contribute to the out-of-plane polarization in (001)-oriented films..",470

We make a special note here that the biaxial strain states studied in this way do not consider the effect of in-plane shear strain as the value of γ is fixed.

In reference to the T phase, the energy per formula unit (f.u.) of M, AO, and PO phases is −128, −95, and −75 meV/f.u., respectively. Figure 3(a) shows the minimum energy paths identified with VC-NEB. The transition barriers are used to gauge the kinetics and are reported in Table I. We find that the three phases, M, AO, and PO, are separated by large barriers (> 100 meV/f.u.≈ 1160 K). In contrary, the transition from the T phase to the other three phases only needs to overcome a small enthalpy barrier, �H̸=(T → AO) = 67, �H̸=(T → PO) = 32, �H̸=(T → M) = 13 meV/f.u., respectively. We propose the T phase is likely to serve as the “precursor” phase during the phase transitions between M, AO, and PO. Notably, the transformation from the T phase to the ferroelectric PO phase is faster kinetically than to the nonpolar AO phase despite the AO phase being lower in enthalpy. This implies the formation of the ferroelectric PO phase is feasible due to the relatively low kinetic barrier.We now compare the two phase transitions that have low barriers: T → M and T → PO. It is found that the transition T → M involves a large change (11% increase) in lattice angle undergoes a modest unit cell variation (see details in Supple-β (between a and c axes) whereas the transition T → PO mental Material). The substantial shear deformation required to realize the T → M transition hints at a stronger impact of substrate clamping. To test this hypothesis, we carry out conventional clamped-cell NEB calculations where the lattice constants are fixed to the values of the T phase, assuming the T phase is the “precursor” phase during the growth of thin films [54]. As revealed in Fig. 3(b), constraining the lattice degrees of freedom drastically affects the transition paths.FIG. 2.

The effect of epitaxial strain in the (001) plane (X[a00]Y [0b0]Z[00c]) on the relative stability of different phases of hafnia was already explored in Ref.

Hanrahan_Epitaxial_strain_HZO_111_PRMater_2019.docx,results,": The compressive strain tends to stabilize the two orthorhombic phases AO and PO over the M phase, while the energy of the nonpolar AO phase is always lower than the polar PO phase [29]. A similar trend is also found for equibiaxial deformations imposed in the (100) plane. However, the M phase remains the lowest-energy phase in (010)-oriented films.To distinguish different crystal orientations, we introduced the convention that the a, b, and c axes of the unit cell are aligned along the cubic crystallographic directions [100], [010], and [001], respectively (Fig. 1). However, it is possible that the c axis of the crystal will align along the [100] or [010] direction of the substrate during the growth or the cooling process after film deposition [57], leading to (100)- or (010)-oriented crystal grown on (001)-oriented substrates. For this reason, it is important to compare energies of all differently oriented crystals (Fig. 4 bottom). We find that the compressive strain (η < 0) induces a M → AO transition above a criticalFIG. 4. (a) Energies of polymorphs of HfO2 in response to epitaxial strains (η) in {001} planes.

The epitaxial strain is measured with respect to the cubic HfO2, η = (a − a0)/a0, where the effective in-plane lattice constant is defined as a = (101)-oriented films, we find the optimal equilibrium strain (at√SXY /√2 (see Fig. 1). Inwhich the energy is a local minimum) of the two orthorhombic phases (η ≈ 1%) is well separated from that of the M phase (η ≈ 7%). This suggests it is possible to stabilize AO and PO phases thermodynamically by depositing HfO2 on a substrate with an in-plane lattice constant of ≈ 5.05 Å if the [a0c] lattice vector of the crystal is controllably oriented along the out-of-plane direction. However, when the constraint on the crystal orientation is lifted, the M phase is favored over a wide range of epitaxial strain conditions (Fig. 5 bottom). Thereis also a compressive strain-induced M → AO transition at η ≈ −0.3%. We now focus on (111)-oriented films where the effectivein-plane lattice constant is calculated using a = [see Fig. 1(b)].

In comparison, the M phase remains the lowest-energy phase at the optimal equilibrium strains of PO and AO phases in (100)/(101)-oriented thin films. In this regard, it is more likely to realize the orthorhombic phase thermodynamically by growing (111)-oriented thin films on selective substrates that offer the right in-plane strains even in the absence of electric field.The remaining issue is the consistent higher energy of the ferroelectric PO phase relative to the AO phase. We propose two mechanisms potentially responsible for the formation of ferroelectric PO phase in thin films. Kinetically, as revealed by our VC-NEB calculations, the transition from the T phase to the PO phase is faster than to the AO phase in a bulklike environment. The substrate orientation and the underlying mechanical clamping will likely affect the transition barriers and kinetics. We suggest the intrinsic barrier heights estimated with VC-NEB are good approximations to those in (111)-oriented thin films at the optimal equilibrium strain where the crystal is in a nearly stress-free equilibrium state similar to a bulk condition. Therefore, if the T phase forms first during the high-temperature annealing process when preparing the thin films, a significant portion of the T phase may transform to the PO phase because of the low activation energy of the T → PO transition. This kinetic argument is supported by recent",1322

In this paper, the as-deposited YHO7 films were heat treated by a rapid thermal furnace at various temperatures. It was found that the as-deposited and lower temperature treatment resulted in the M phase whereas a higher temperature treatment leads to more O/T phases. Further in situ high-temperature x-ray diffraction measurement indicates that the M phase has transformed to the T phase above 950◦C, and the O phase appears below 300◦C during the cooling process. Our DFT calculations therefore offer a possible explanation to the origin of ferro-electricity in (111)-oriented YHO7 thin films consisting of a single orthorhombic phase [59].Thermodynamically, the presence of an external field along the polar axis will favor the PO phase and induce the AO the “wake-up” effect observed",358

Hanrahan_Epitaxial_strain_HZO_111_PRMater_2019.docx,CONCLUSION,"SIn summary, we have investigated the kinetic effects of phase transitions on the emergence of ferroelectricity in HfO2 thin films by quantifying the transition barriers between different polymorphs of hafnia with DFT calculations. The multiwell potential energy surface obtained with the VC-NEB technique suggests that the mixture of different phases often presented in HfO2-based thin films has both kinetic and thermodynamic reasons. We propose that the T P42/nmc phase, likely formed during the annealing process at high temperatures, is the key “precursor” phase, responsible for the formation of M and orthorhombic phases because of the low transition barriers. One important finding is that the transition from the T phase to the PO Pca21 phase is kinetically faster than the transition to the competing nonpolar Pbca phase, though the latter is favored thermodynamically. Additionally, the transition barriers depend strongly on themechanical boundary conditions. In particular, when the shear deformation required for the T to M phase transition becomes inaccessible (e.g., clamping by grains or capping electrodes), the formation of the M phase will be suppressed whereas the formation of the PO phase is favored.Growing differently oriented crystals on substrates of un-conventional cuts offers a modality to tune the mechani-cal boundary conditions. We systematically investigate the effects of growth orientations and epitaxial strains on the relative stability of different phases of HfO2. In agreement with previous studies, the biaxial compressive stress will drive the M to orthorhombic transition. Notably, the two orthorhombic phases at their optimal equilibrium strains are thermodynamically more stable than the M phase in (111)-oriented thin films. Combined with the kinetic effect that the transformation from the T phase to the PO phase is faster than to the nonpolar AO phase, we propose it is likely to better stabilize the ferroelectric Pca21 phase in (111)-oriented thin films via appropriate thermal annealing process even in the absence of external electric fields. Recent realization of single orthorhombic phase in (111)-oriented ferroelectric Y-doped HfO2 thin films further supports our findings. These",476

We found that the polarization of the hafnia films is a function of the annealing time, temperature, and the film thick-ness with a maximum remnant polarization (Pr) of 10 µC cm−2. From our bending test, the ferroelectricity can be retained under a bending radius below 8 mm with bending cycles up to 1000 times. Finally, we developed a novel low voltage vertical ferroelectric transistor on a flexible substrate, demonstrating the feasibility of these materials for flexible memory applications.2.",587
So_HZO_flexible_substrate_ADFM_2017.docx,Discussion,"s2.1. Growth of HfxZr1−xO2 Thin Films on Glass SubstratesThin films of pure HfO2 with a monoclinic (P21/c) crystal structure are known to have a high dielectric constant. Hafnia ferroelectric films typically require a high crystallization temperature to form the ferroelectric phase which is known to be a polar orthorhombic phase (Pca21),[1a] and Si wafers are Adv.

Formation of the polar orthorhombic phase in HfO2 films can be induced by vari- ous dopants such as Al, Ga, Co/Ni, Si, Gd, Sr, Er, Ba, La, Y, N, and Zr.[8] These dopants appear to contribute to the formation of a nonferroelectric tetragonal phase (P42/nmc) in HfO2 films which subsequently transform to the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase upon thermal annealing.[1a,9] In this work, Zr dopant was used because it requires a lower activation energy to transform to the orthorhombic phase compared to other dopant systems,[9] allowing lower processing temperatures.Growth of thin hafnia films on a plastic substrate requires a different processing condition compared to processing on silicon substrates due to the noncrystalline nature of the plastic surface and a lower thermal conductivity of the plastic sub-strate. To understand the crystallization process of hafnia films on amorphous substrates, HfxZr1−xO2 films were grown on glass substrates and the structure of the capacitor used for the study is presented in Figure1a. HfxZr1−xO2 films were deposi- ted by atomic layer deposition and the details are given in the",483
So_HZO_flexible_substrate_ADFM_2017.docx,Experiment,"al Section. To grow a hafnia ferroelectric thin film, TiN electrodes were used due to their mechanical confinement to suppress the formation of the nonferroelectric phases.[10] Indium tin oxide (ITO) films were used for the contact elec-trodes of the ferroelectric capacitor.The polarization–electric field behavior of the HfxZr1−xO2 thin film capacitors are shown in Figure 1b with different Zr doping ratio. We found that the resulting capacitors reveal the dielectric, ferroelectric, and antiferroelectric properties of the films depending on the composition, with a composition of Hf:Zr = 1:1 showing the largest ferroelectric polarization (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The polarization–electric field loop of the ferroelectric capacitor (Hf:Zr = 1:1) shows a shift to the positive bias region due to an asymmetric distribu-tion of charge such as oxygen vacancy across the ferroelectric layer.[11] This ferroelectric-to-nonferroelectric transition due to Zr doping is in agreement with the previous report on HfxZr1−xO2 films on Si substrates.[7a] Figure 1c shows the remnant polarization of the ferroelec-tric capacitor as function of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film thickness (Figure S2, Supporting Information). As seen in the figure, 2Pr is only 1 µC cm−2 for the 10 nm thick film while 2Pr> 10 µC cm−2 is observed for films thicker than 20 nm. This is different from the reported Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 ferroelectric films on Si substrates which exhibited the strongest polarization at thick-nesses below 10 nm.[9] The difference may be due to the fact that glass substrates have a much lower thermal conductivity and lower thermal expansion coefficient compared to Si sub-strates, leading to a different growth mechanism of the ferro-electric phase. It is reported that a tensile stress in the doped hafnia film might induce the formation of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase.[10b] The large difference in thermal expan-sion coefficient between the glass substrate and the hafnia film may be beneficial for such a strain. To understand the phase distribution within the films, grazing incidence X-ray Figure 1.

The sample structure is TiN/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/TiN/glass and the reference peaks at the bottom are from the powder diffraction peaks of HfO2.Adv. Funct.

KGaA, Weinheimwww.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.dediffraction (GIXRD) was performed on Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films with different thicknesses. As observed in Figure 1d, distinct crys-talline peaks appear in the films with a thickness over 20 nm. More importantly, as the film thickness increases from 20 to 40 nm, the diffraction peak at 30.65° shifts to 30.55°. The shift in diffraction peak may be due to the increased fraction of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase (peaked at 30.15°) relative to the nonferroelectric tetragonal phase (peaked at 30.25°), which is also reflected from the data in Figure 1c where Pr increases as the film thickness is increased from 22 to 35 nm. As the film thickness is further increased to 40 nm, the intensities of the peaks at 28.4° and 31.65° are increased, resulting in an increase of the fraction of the nonferroelectric monoclinic phase. In addition, for P–E measurements of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 capacitors with film thickness larger than 35 nm, the applied electric field was reduced from 3 to 2 MV cm−1 due to the electric break-down of the capacitors. The abrupt decrease in Pr between 35 and 40 nm might result from the lower applied field, sug-gesting that the ferroelectric properties can be retained even over 40 nm thickness. With a proper interfacial treatment to suppress the breakdown, the ferroelectricity of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films thicker than 40 nm may be further improved.[12] From these",1149

Growth of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Thin Films on Flexible SubstratesUsing the optimized film described above, a flexible capacitor with the following structure of ITO (100 nm)/TiN (50 nm)/ Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (30 nm)/TiN (50 nm)/ITO (100 nm)/polyimide substrate was fabricated. For the ferroelectric capacitors on glass substrates shown in the previous section, rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 500 °C for 30 s was used to crystallize the films. However, we observed that the polyimide films deformed during the RTA process even at 300 °C due to thermal shock as shown in the left inset of Figure2a. In order to alleviate this problem, the polyimide films were placed in a chamber consisting of an aluminum bottom plate and a cover glass petri dish with the chamber placed on a preheated hot plate as shown in the bottom inset of Figure 2a. The actual sample temperature was measured using a thermocouple. By con-trolling the heating rate in this setup, thermal degradation of the film was not observed even with the substrate heated to a temperature up to 430 °C as shown in the right inset of the Figure 2a. Figure 2b shows the polarization versus electric field of a flexible capacitor after heated at 380 °C for 2 min. A clear hysteresis loop is observed with a 2Pr value of 15 µC cm−2 at a coercive field of 1 MV/cm, showing a ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film on the polyimide substrate.2.2.1. Effect of Annealing Times and Annealing TemperaturesThe polarization of the flexible capacitor depends on the annealing time and the annealing temperature as shown in Figure 2c (raw data in Figure S3, Supporting Information). The fact that the polarization increases with annealing time indi-cates that the fraction of ferroelectric phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2Figure 2.

At 330 °C, the polarization is weak due to insufficient annealing to form the ferroelectric phase. As the temperature is increased from 330 to 430 °C, Adv. Funct.

KGaA, Weinheimthe 2Pr value increases rapidly as a function of the annealing time, indicating a larger fraction of ferroelectric phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film is formed at higher annealing temperatures. The maximum 2Pr of 19 µC cm−2 observed at 430 °C for 90 s is comparable to the polarization density of the ferroelectric capac-itor on the glass substrates shown in Figure 1c, revealing that the ferroelectricity of the hafnia films does not degrade by the controlled annealing process on plastic substrates. The 2Pr value of our flexible hafnia film is about 20% larger than the values reported from the flexible organic ferroelectric thin films.[2f,13] From this",932
So_HZO_flexible_substrate_ADFM_2017.docx,experiment,", we found that the optimum annealing condition of this flexible ferroelectric capacitor is at 380–430 °C for 90–120 s. Temperatures higher than 430 °C could not be applied due to thermal degradation of the polyi-mide substrate.. It is noted that compared to the ferroelectric capacitor on the glass substrate, a relatively longer annealing time is required for the polyimide substrates.. However, pro-longed annealing to 150 s above 380 °C leads to a decrease in 2Pr due to thermal degradation of the polyimide substrates.. 2.2.2.. Effect of Bending Radius and Bending Cycles To test the flexibility of our hafnia films, a bending test was car-ried out.. Figure3a illustrates the polarization of the capacitor as a function of the bending radius.. The dashed line shows the 2Pr values measured before the bending.. The 2Pr value shows no degradation in ferroelectricity until the bending radius reaches 5 mm which is comparable as the minimum bending radius demonstrated in previous organic ferroelectric devices.. [2b] At radii below 5 mm, extreme bending leads to electrical break-down and no ferroelectric polarization was observed.. Figure 3b demonstrates the effect of repetitive bending on remnant polar-ization.. Here, the radius for the bending cycle test was fixed at 8 mm.. The ferroelectric capacitor endures repetitive bending up to 1000 cycles and bending beyond 2000 cycles resulted in shorting and complete loss of ferroelectricity.. This excellent bending tolerance is due to the ultrathin thickness of the fer-roelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film.. It should be noted that a slight increase in 2Pr is observed as the bending cycle is increased up to about 700 cycles.. To understand this effect, laboratory-based GIXRD was performed on samples with different bending cycles.. Figure 3c shows the diffraction patterns for samples with different bending cycles.. The overall increase of the intensity at 2 theta below 30° is due to the broad diffraction signal from the polyimide substrate (Figure S4, Supporting Information).. We found that the diffraction peak at 30.5° is slightly shifted to 30.3° as the bending cycle is increased.. This is probably due to an increased fraction of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase (30.15°) resulting in a slight increase in 2Pr up to 500 cycles..",511

All hysteresis curves were acquired using a bipolar waveform with In summary, we have demonstrated ferroelectric hafnia thin films on plastic substrates by developing a nonrapid thermal annealing process. The formation of the ferroelectric phase and hence the polarization were prominent at the ferroelectric film thickness over 20 nm due to the usage of the amorphous plastic substrate. The ferroelectricity was retained at a bending radius below 8 mm and up to 1000 bending cycles. We also observed the evolution of the ferroelectric phase with increased bending cycles which was confirmed by 2D GIWAXS measurements. Finally, a novel, vertical, ferroelectric transistor was demon-strated with 10 years of retention characteristic extrapolated. The delineated work represents a new opportunity of flexible applications based on inorganic ferroelectric films for future a frequency of 1 kHz. Before measuring the hysteresis, 10 000 cycles of sine wave electric field (2 MV cm−1 and 1 kHz) was applied to wake up the ferroelectric film. The performance of VFeFET was measured using Keithley 4200 where the gate voltage pulse was applied and the transfer characteristic was analyzed. For the bending test, a customized bending machine consisting of metal clamps to hold a flexible substrate on both sides and an automatic handle to vary the distance between the clamps to control the bending radius was used (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The bending radius was precisely controlled and calculated by comparing the distance before and after the bending.

Next, a 50 nm thick TiN film was deposited on the substrate by radiofrequency sputtering at 2 mTorr of chamber pressure and 50 sccm of Ar flow (Kurt J. Lesker PVD system, PRD036170) from a TiN target (purchased from Kurt J. Lesker). Immediately after sputtering, the sample was moved to an atomic layer deposition (ALD) chamber (Ultratech Savannah 200) for growth of HfxZr1−xO2 films. Tetrakis(dimethylamino)hafnium (Strem Chemical, Inc., 98-4021) was used for Hf precursor and tetrakis(dimethylamino) zirconium (Strem Chemical, Inc., 98-4012) was used for Zr precursor. Ozone was used for oxygen source in the ALD chamber. To control the Zr doping ratio, different cycles of HfO2 and ZrO2 recipe were used at a chamber temperature of 250 °C. For Hf:Zr = 1:1 doping ratio, alternative cycles of HfO2 and ZrO2 recipe were used where each cycle corresponds to 0.95 Å thick film.

This would result in a tilted polarization axis after wake-upThe strong differences in the HSO microstructure for MFM and MFIS samples (as summarized in Table I) are further underlined when analyzing their crystallographic texture. While an out-of-plane texture of the [002]- and [020]-axis was reported for HSO and HZO MFM samples,3,15,25a different texture is observed on the MFIS stacks. As shown with the inverse pole figure (IPF) maps in Fig. 3(a), MFIS samples annealed at 1000�C indicate a clear out-of-plane texture as well. Some grains aligned closely to the [010]- or [001]-axis appear with dots or larger connected regions of the [001]- or [010]-axis, respectively, a signature that can be easily assigned to either misin-dexing or ferroelasticity, as these are the axes that most likely undergo ferroelastic switching.26 For a detailed analysis of the out-of-plane texture, pole figures are extracted [see Fig. 3(b)]. Here, the [010]-axis does not align fully parallel but rather donut-shaped around the out-of-plane axisand, therefore, in an increase in the effective coercive field of the layer. A similar orientation of the polarization axis has also been reported for a 22-nm FeFET.15 With decreasing annealing temperature, this texture becomes less dominant while more [111]- and [101]-axes align out-of-plane [see Fig. 3(c)]. This agrees well with the measured GIXRD patterns [see Fig. 3(d)], where an increased intensity of the diffraction line at 24�, corresponding to the (110) index, is observed for the 1000�C anneal. Minor shifts of the diffraction lines to higher angles are likely to originate from strain inside the layer. Nevertheless, a texture that might be described by a preferred absence of all h100i axes is very sur-prising for a layer grown on an amorphous substrate, as no orienta-tional information can be transferred to the hafnium oxide. Moreover, the polymorphic phase transitions that HfO2 is likely to undergo would not enable the formation of such a texture.FIG. 3. TKD microstructure analysis: (a) inverse pole figure maps of the x, y, and z planes for the sample annealed at 1000�C highlight the presence of an out-of-plane tex-ture; (b) pole figures of the same sample indicate the sample normal vector to be [110] aligned; (c) inverse pole figures of the z plane show an increasing texture along the [110] and [011] axes when raising the annealing temperature.

In order to remove misindexing or ferroelastic contri-butions, cubic symmetry operations are applied to highlight these gradients [see Fig. 4(a)]. When calculating the mean orientation of every grain, intra-granual misorientation can be visualized. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the misorientation is especially high in the dendrites. As this correlates with increased stress and defect level, it is very likely to assume that the interplay of ferroelectric and ferroelastic switching will differ in these regions. Note that beyond such local stress fields, the thermal expansion mismatch between adjacent layers will equally impact the ferroelectric switching behavior.As the presence of diffusion cannot be ruled out for the annealing temperatures used here, the chemical composition of the layer stack is investigated as well using time-of-flight secondary-ion-mass-spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). When mapping the area-integrated signal intensity of selected molecular ions, oxidation at both interfa-ces of the TiN layers is observed for samples annealed at 650�C and 1000�C, respectively. Moreover, the SiO2 interface layer shows accumulation of nitrogen when annealing at 1000�C, indicat-ing diffusion of nitrogen through the HSO layer [see Fig. 5(a)]. Furthermore, an increase in the interfacial layer thickness is observed. This increase is also present in the HfSiO4�signal, sugges-ting the presence of hafnium or the formation of hafnon (HfSiO4) inFIG. 4. Extraction of intragranular misorientation: (a) under the assumption of higher (cubic) symmetry, 90�-angle based misindexing and ferroelastic components disappear, but lattice distortions remain, as shown for the sample annealed at 650�C; (b) this allows calculating the intra-granular misorientation angle with respect to the mean orientation, showing strong distortions for dendrites.FIG. 5.

Nevertheless, the SiO2 interface layer still is amorphous as confirmed by transmission elec-tron microscopy [see Fig. 5(b)]. Consequently, the crystallization anneal of Si-doped hafnium oxide on an interface layer is character-ized by the subtle interplay of diffusion and crystallization processes. As mentioned above, diffusion alone cannot explain the observed textures, as the interface layer remains amorphous.In",723
Lederer_TKD_HSO_Si_TiN_APL_2021.docx,conclusion,", TKD measurements of Si-doped hafnium oxide layers grown on silicon oxide reveal a microstructure dominated by dendritic orthorhombic grains, having an average equivalent diameter of about 230 nm for annealing temperatures ranging from 650�C to 1000�C. Additionally, a strong [110] and [011] out-of-plane texture is found that becomes more prominent with increasing annealing tem-peratures. This strongly contrasts HfO2 layers grown on polycrystal-line TiN layers, which have a significantly smaller grain size and show considerable [020] or [002] out-of-plane textures.3,15Misorientation analysis highlights the strong mechanically induced distortions observed for dendrites, while ToF-SIMS measurements indicate both an increased thickness and nitrogen concentration of interface layers. MFIS structures, hence, show a fundamentally altered interface mor-phology and texture compared to MFM samples, with a clear impact on their ferroelectric switching behavior.Appl. Phys.

There is also a memory for all previously acquired maximal values, as long as these are below a certain threshold value that is able to wipe out the previous history. One speaks of hyster-etic behavior with nonlocal memory.1On the microscopic level, various phenomena contribute to the measured polar-ization.

The irreversible hysteretic part is conveniently described by the Preisach model, a mathematical model that takes into account a statistical density of rectangular hysteresis loops.

The testing bench measurement principle de-picted in Fig. 1 permits the elimination of the influence of generator impedance. The current flowing in the sample is provided by an operational transductance amplifier. This de-vice is controlled by a feedback loop which performs the control of the sample voltage. The controller is designed in order to provide a closed-loop bandwidth greater than 50 kHz. It is not necessary to implement an integration in the voltage controller due to the integrator behavior of the sample. Thus, the control devices operate in such a manner that the electric field E applied to the device is equal to the reference Eref for low frequency transients. The current is measured by using a current viewing resistor connected in series upstream from the sample under test. The measure-ment resistance varies in a range of 1 k�–100 M� so that an accurate measurement can be performed over more than 6 frequency decades.In the feedback loop, the sample voltage is measured using a field effect transistor input follower. The input im-pedance of this device can be modeled by a capacitor con-nected in parallel with the sample. The corresponding ca-pacitance will be taken into account in measuring the reversible effect of the sample and thus eliminated. There-fore, in this testing bench, voltage applied to the sample is perfectly controlled while the electric current is measured. The electric displacement D is approximately equal to P, as�0E�P. P is composed of a local reversible part Prev �lattice and reversible small signal domain wall contributions�, and an local irreversible effect Pirr which is due to domain switching �Eq. �1��The reversible effect can be measured by applying a low level ac voltage around either a dc or a slowly varying voltage.7This effect can be modeled by a field dependent capacitance C(E).

These transient problems can be reduced by adding a floor step when electric field rises to either the maximum or the minimum voltage level. In this case, tran-sient effects will not have any influence on the DSED calcu-lation.The current measured in the sample using such a voltage wave form is shown in Fig. 3. The plot of Fig. 4 giving the polarization versus the electric field strength is obtained by integration of the sample current with respect to time and then by plotting this value divided by S as a function of the electric field �voltage divided by h�. At the same time, the low level capacitive effect is measured using the lock-in am-plifier. The two effects are compared in Fig. 5. This figure shows the evolution of the derivative of polarization with respect to sample voltage versus the electric field strength and leads to the butterfly hysteresis representation.According to Eq. �6� DSED �H(E)� is calculated by sub-traction of the reversible contribution to the total effect. Then, the ferroelectric loop due to irreversible switching can be calculated by integration of Eq. �5� �see Fig. 6�. The 1/2 Psat factor in Eq. �5� serves to normalize this integral.

Thus frequency depen-dence of the low level capacitive effect can be neglected.On the other hand DSED is different from zero when the electric field reaches an extreme value, meaning that satura-tion is not achieved.

EPD is also null beyond the macroscopic electric satu-ration raised for Esat electric field strength. This density can thus be drawn inside an isosceles triangular shape as shown in Fig. 8. Note that the upper triangular part of the shape corresponds to elementary cycles having two positive thresh-olds, whereas the lower triangular shape corresponds to two negative thresholds, i.e., back switches. Finally, cycles placed in the last square part of the shape have a positive and a negative threshold. EPD evaluation can be done using DSED and measured as described in the previous section.For example, during electric field periodic variation be-tween Emin and Emax, switching will occur for domains placed in a triangular shape given by Y�Emin and X�Emax. In the case of an electric field increase (dE�0), the variable X is taken to be equal to the applied electric field strength, which varies from Emin to Emax. In that case, DSED corresponds to the EPD projection on the X axis �Eq. �7��1:1�Pirr�E�E�N�E,Y �dY�Hi�E,Emin�,2Psat�E�EmindE�0.�7�FIG. 8.

The main difficulty consists therefore in the choice of electric loading, which must provide enough inde-pendent measures to calculate each value of EPD. The way of operating such measurements is described in Sec. VI.VI. EPD DETERMINATIONEPD can be calculated by the derivative of DSED mea-sured for different values of maximal or minimal electric field strength �Eqs. �9� and �10��. It is interesting to imple-ment a method in which the mean value of the electrical field remains null. This condition is fulfilled when the electric field, drawn in Fig. 9, is applied to the sample. In this wave form, note that Emax and Emin vary both in the same way.With the electric field increasing, EPD can be calculated in a triangular shape with boundaries defined by Y��X,3550Rev. Sci.

In this case, the decreas-ing field E is equal to Y. On the right hand side DSED is represented as evaluated during increasing electric field strength, with respect to Emin. In this case, increasing field E is equal to X. EPD can then be evaluated in the gray zone defined in Fig. 8 by the derivative of Hi(E,Emin) with respect to Emin for increasing field and in the white zone defined in Fig. 8 by the derivative of Hd(Emax,E) with respect to Emax for the decreasing field. Note that calculation is difficult near the Y��X axis. To overcome this problem, the number of measurements is increased and a linear interpolation is used around this axis. EPD �drawn in Fig. 11� is normalized as-suming that saturation is almost achieved. This gives a dif-ferent method for determination of polarization at saturation.

Muralt_Preisach_RevSciIntr_2002.docx,DISCUSSION,"In this article, the EPD method has been introduced as well as the testing bench developed in order to perform its measurement. It was assumed that a macroscopic loop can be decomposed into an elementary nonsymmetrical rectangular cycle. This yields a two-variable model in which the positive and negative thresholds have to be defined for each elemen-tary cycle, leading to the EPD, a 2D domain switching den-sity. A physical model was considered, associating each el-ementary cycle with a single domain crystallite characterized by both a local bias field and a coercive field. Thus EPD allows observation of the switching mechanism via the dis-tribution of these local fields. Gondro et al.13assumes that trapped charges at the electrode interface generate a local bias field in these regions. This internal bias field locally modifies the switching criteria and could be responsible for fatigue. This electrode effect is modeled in EPD by the pres-ence of three different 2D Gaussian distributions: one for each electrode effect with average bias field of opposite signs and one for the inner region. We confirm these assumptions by measurements of EPD before poling of the sample �Fig. 18�.FIG. 18. EPD determined before poling. �a� top view and �b� side view.It appears clearly that two opposite, nonsymmetrical, in-ternal bias field exist in the sample. These internal fields, and the trapped charges they represent, seem to disappear after poling �Fig. 11�. However, it can be postulated that these internal bias fields have just been decreased, thus perhaps superimposing two or three different 2D Gaussian functions might provide a more accurate modeling of Preisach density. This may also justify previous errors introduced by the Nest calculation. Improvement of the model fitting to the Preisach density in a ferroelectric simulator is an important challenge because it greatly affects the values of the parameters in-volved. In addition, EPD is potentially a very useful way to characterize ferroelectric ceramic behavior and properties, such as temperature, pressure, frequency, and aging effects on domain switching mechanisms.1Isaac Mayergoyz, Mathematical Models of Hysteresis �Springer, New York, 1991�.2S.

Rampi_HfO2_ChemMaterial_2017.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Intentionally added impurities, i.e., dopants, can completely alter the physical properties of the host material. While in some cases, the additional electrons or holes contributed by the dopants dramatically modify the electronic structure, thereby changing properties like the electrical conductivity1and magnetism,2in other cases, the small doping-induced perturbation is enough to alter the atomic arrangement (crystal structure) of the host system (e.g., yttrium stabilized zirconia). Hafnia (HfO2), a well-known linear dielectric material,3−7is likely an example of the latter, as doped thin films of this material have been recently observed to exhibit ferroelectric (FE) behavior through the formation of a nonequilibrium polar phase.8,9Despite a great number of",171
Rampi_HfO2_ChemMaterial_2017.docx,experiment,"al and theoretical studies,10−13the origin of this novel functionality, which finds applications in FE-field effect transistors14and FE-random access memories,15has not been completely under-stood.In the most likely mechanism, some “suitable” combination of surface energy, mechanical stresses, oxygen vacancies, dopants, and the electrical history of the hafnia film is postulated to stabilize the polar orthorhombic Pca21 (P-O1) phase over the equilibrium monoclinic (M) phase of hafnia, thus enabling the FE behavior.16−19The disappearance of ferroelectricity in the absence of a capping electrode and with increasing film thickness suggests the critical role of the mechanical stresses8 , 2 0 − 2 4 and surface ener-gies,11−13respectively. Similarly, the demonstration of the“wake-up effect” (on application of external electric fields)hints at the role that the electrical history of the film plays in stabilizing the FE phase.25−27Dopants, too, have been found to increase the stability “window” of the P-O1 phase as reflected in an increase in both the magnitude of the measured polarization and the critical thickness of the hafnia film (below which FE behavior is observed).9Some insight into the role of dopants has emerged from recent empirical studies,17,18which have indicated the trend of dopants with higher ionic radii leading to enhanced polarization. Nevertheless, the true role of the dopants in the formation of the P-O1 phase remains unclear, given that traditionally doping is known to stabilize the high-temperature tetragonal (T) or the cubic phases of hafnia.28−30 Two critical questions, important from both application and theoretical standpoints, that these recent studies8,18,23,24,31on FE-doped hafnia raise are (1) which dopant favor the polar phase the most and at what concentration?, and (2) do dopants play a critical role in stabilizing this polar phase in hafnia films, and if yes, which attributes of a dopant (chemical or physical) are relevant?In this contribution, we address these questions using high-throughput first-principles density functional theory (DFT) computations. In order to address the first question, we follow a three-stage down-selection strategy, illustrated in Figure 1, wherein we examine the influence of nearly 40 dopants on the energetics of the relevant low-energy phases of hafnia, includingReceived:July 7, 2017Revised:October 12, 2017Published: October 13, 2017© 2017 American Chemical Society9102DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02835 Chem.

On the basis of these energy changes, the initial set of nearly 40 dopants in Stage 1 is down-selected to 14 dopants in Stage 2, and finally, to the 6 most promising dopants, i.e., Ca, Sr, Ba, Y, La, and Gd, in Stage 3. In agreement with empirical observations,17,18our study revealed that these 6 dopants favor the stabilization of the P-O1 phase of hafnia. To answer the second question, the computational data obtained in Stage 3 was analyzed. Clear trends illustrating that dopants with higher ionic radii and lower electronegativity stabilize the P-O1 phase the most were found, also consistent with the",877
Rampi_HfO2_ChemMaterial_2017.docx,experiment,"al observations.18The root-cause of these trends is traced to the formation of an additional bond between the dopant and the second nearest-neighbor oxygen atom. On the basis of these findings, we search the entire periodic table, predicting the lanthanides, the lower half of the alkaline earth metals (i.e., Ca, Sr, Ba) and Y as the most favorable dopants to promote ferroelectricity in hafnia.Theoretical Methods. Our work is based on electronic structure DFT calculations, performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package32(VASP) employing the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional33and the projector-augmented wave methodology.34A 3 × 3 × 3 Monkhorst−Pack mesh35for k-point sampling was adopted and a basis set of plane waves with kinetic energies up to 500 eV was used to represent the wave functions. For each doped phase, spin polarized computations were performed and all atoms were allowed to relax until atomic forces were smaller than 10−2eV/Å.To determine the energy ordering of phases in doped hafnia, we define the relative energy of a phase α with respect to the equilibrium M phase in the presence of a dopant D asΔ E D α−M = E D α−E D M (1)where ED α and ED M are the DFT computed energies of the doped α and M phases, respectively. To highlight the direct role of a dopant in stabilizing the phase α, we subtract from eq 1 a term corresponding to the energy of dopant-free pure phases:Δ E D α−−M Pure = ( E D α−E D M )−( E Pure α−E Pure M ) (2)where EPure α and EPure M are the DFT computed energies of pure α and M phases, respectively. ΔED−Pure α−M represents the change in the relative energy of the phase α with respect to the M phase solely due to the",525

As captured in Figure 2a, the M phase remains the equilibrium phase for all the dopants considered at 3.125% doping concentration, although the energy differences among the hafnia phases change significantly. The relative energy of T phase alters substantially more with the choice of the dopant (e.g., Ge, Au, etc.) in comparison to that of the P-O1, P-O2, and OA phases, possibly due to the different coordination environment experienced by a dopant cation in the T (coordination number = 8) versus the other phases (coordination number = 7) considered here. Interestingly, the T phase of Pd- and Pt-doped hafnia collapse into the P-O1 phase (see Supporting Information for details) upon atomic relaxation (resulting in absence of these data points in Figure 2). An important implication of this finding is that even small perturbations can possibly result in T to P-O1 phase transformations, and can be a potential pathway of formation of the P-O1 phase in hafnia. We will continue to encounter this collapse of the T phase to the P-O1 phase in later stages of this work as well.Owing to the large energy scale and the small doping level, the influence of dopants on the phase stability appears feeble in Figure 2a. This picture, however, changes substantially when we replot it using eq 2 as shown in Figure 2b. We again caution here that the quantity ΔED−Pure α−M plotted in Figure 2b only helps us identify the phase(s) a dopant prefers over the M phase, and not the lowest energy ground state of hafnia, which is indeed determined by the quantity ΔED α−M. Two key trends to be observed in Figure 2b are (1) row IV and row V dopants follow very similar phase stability trends when moving from left to right across the periodic table, with the row V dopants inducing larger energy variations, and (2) dopants from alkaline earth, and group 3, 10, 11, and 12 of the periodic table tend to favor the P-O1 and/or the P-O2 phases in hafnia, leading to the9104 DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02835Chemistry of MaterialsArticleFigure 3.

Thus, we further reduce our configurational space to cases which involve breakage of only 3 Hf−O bonds in the M, P-O1, OA, and P-O2 phases. This leaves us with 3 different choices for the M, P-O1, OA phases, and 2 choices for each of the O2 and T phases. For each phase, only the configuration with lowest energy was considered in order to obtain the phase stability trends presented in Figure 3. To summarize, in Stage 2 we computed the phase stability of hafnia at dopant concentration of 3.125% for the case of the 10 shortlisted divalent elements, and with the restrictions of Ovac being in nearest-neighbor site of the dopant and occupying an O site with 3 Hf−O bonds in the case of M, P-O1, OA, and O2 phases.

Rampi_HfO2_ChemMaterial_2017.docx,introduction,"(e.g., compare the open and solid symbols for the case of Cu and Zn in Figure 3). On the other hand, the T phase is consistently favored with the addition of Ovac due to the lowering of the coordination number of the vacancy neighboring Hf atoms from 8 to 7, which is energetically preferred, and is also the reason why the M phase is the equilibrium phase of hafnia. This behavior is consistent with the past study.38The Cu- and Ag-doped T phase was, however, found to collapse into the polar P-O1 phase. Further investigations are necessary to identify what triggers this collapse of the T phase into the P-O1 phase. Nevertheless, the important trend to be observed in Figure 3 is that the alkaline earth metals like Ca, Sr, and Ba favor the polar phase(s) substantially more than the remaining 7 divalent dopants (e.g., Cu, Zn, Pd) considered in Stage 2. Thus, these 3 alkaline earth metals, along with the previously selected trivalent dopants (Y, La, Au, and Gd), were selected to form the final set of 7 most promising candidates to be comprehensively studied in Stage 3.Stage 3. From the initial set of ∼40 dopants, we are now left with the 7 most promising candidates in Stage 3 that favor the polar phase(s) in hafnia.

Rampi_HfO2_ChemMaterial_2017.docx,experiment,"al observations of this phase.19 One important limitation/assumption of the above study pertaining to the dopant and Ovac arrangement should be mentioned here. Higher doping concentration (6.25% and 12.5%) leads to a rather challenging modeling problem of expansion of the configurational space. For instance, for the case of 6.25% Sr-doped hafnia, the two Sr atoms would lie on any two sites of the cation sublattice and the associated two Ovac on any two sites of the anion sublattice. Even after discounting for the symmetry of the system, a huge number of such permutations (or configurations) are possible and it is not at all trivial to determine which among them would be energetically preferred. Further, to finally determine the phase stability of doped hafnia, one would have to ascertain the lowest energy configuration of each phase. Although methods, such as, cluster expansion,39etc., can be used to surmount this problem of large configurational space, these approaches are extremely computationally demanding. Nevertheless, we get some estimate of the scale of energy variations expected in our doped hafnia systems owing to the different possible configurations by computing energies of 10 diverse config-urations of 6.25% Sr-doped P-O1 phase at various dopant−dopant distances. A standard deviation of just ∼8 meV/f.u. in the energies of these configurations was found, suggesting that the scale of energy variations owing to different possible configurations of dopants is rather small as compared to that of the relative energies among the different phases of hafnia. Thus, we expect the trends observed in the Figure 4 and the",356

mueller2012.docx,Abstract,"—Ferroelectric properties of Si-doped HfO2 thin films (10 nm) have been investigated. The focus of this letter is to evaluate the potential applicability of these thin films for future 3-D ferroelectric random access memory capacitors. Polariza-tion switching was tested at elevated temperatures up to 185◦C and showed no severe degradation. Domain switching dynam-ics were electrically characterized with pulse-switching tests and were not in accordance with Kolmogorov–Avrami-type switching. Nucleation-limited switching is proposed to be applicable for these new types of ferroelectric thin films. Furthermore, same-state and opposite-state retention tests were performed at 125◦C up to 20 h. It was found that samples that had previously been annealed at 800◦C showed improved retention of the written state as well as of the opposite state.

As previous studies have shown [3], this represents a major obstacle for traditional ferroelectric materials since the ferroelectric properties degrade or even vanish for small film thicknesses.On the other hand, there are certain dielectrics, like STO, which possess paraelectric properties as bulk materials but become ferroelectric under certain conditions like mechanical confinement or doping [4], [5]. Only recently, these properties have been discovered for doped HfO2 [6]–[10]. Incorporation of substituting elements like silicon, zirconium, yttrium, or alu-minum as well as mechanical confinement using TiN electrodes can stabilize a ferroelectric phase in hafnium oxide.II.",741
mueller2012.docx,EXPERIMENT,"SIn order to characterize polarization switching of the substi-tuted hafnium oxide, metal–insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors (104µm2) were manufactured on highly doped silicon sub-strates. TiN bottom and top electrodes of 10-nm thickness were deposited by pulsed chemical vapor deposition at 450◦C, and the 10-nm ferroelectric Si:HfO2 was formed by atomic layer deposition at 350◦C. The precursor gases tetrakisethylmethy-laminohafnium and tetrakisdimethylaminosilane were used in a 16 : 1 pulsing ratio effectively achieving 3.8 mol% of incorpo-rated SiO2. Rapid thermal annealing was carried out at 650◦C in nitrogen environment. Evaporated platinum dots served as contact for electrical characterization.

mueller2012.docx,DISCUSSION,"In order to analyze the switching characteristics of the thin-film ferroelectric, standard pulse-switching tests were carried out. Four voltage pulses were applied to the MIM capacitor, whereas only the first pulse was of opposite polarity. By sub-tracting the current response of the second and the fourth pulses, it is possible to extract the real ferroelectric switching current. Delay times of 1 s between all of the pulses reduce potential errors due to relaxation. These tests were performed for various symmetric voltage amplitudes and at different temperaturesFig. 3. Normalized switched polarization versus WRITE pulsewidth for (top) negative and (bottom) positive WRITE amplitudes. The linear relationship between pulsewidth and switched charge indicates that switching is nucleation limited and not governed by the speed of domain wall motion. Polarity depen-dence of switching speed reflects imprint characteristics as observed previously. The normalization was performed with respect to PSW obtained for 3 V at 0.1-s pulsewidth.We observed a logarithmic dependence of switched polar-ization and WRITE pulsewidth for voltages close to the co-ercive voltage. This behavior is not in accordance with the traditional Kolmogorov–Avrami switching which would pre-dict an exponential dependence between switched polariza-tion and pulsewidth [11]–[13]. A similar behavior has already been observed for polycrystalline Pb(Zr, Ti)O3 thin films with 135-nm thickness [14], and a nucleation-limited switching (NLS) model had been derived. This model neglects the kinetics of domain coalescence and is mainly based on nucleation statistics represented by a partially defined distribution function g(z) [15]. As already mentioned, a consistent data set could be achieved for pulsewidths between 10 µs and 100 ms. Within this range, a logarithmic fit led to a good interpolation of the acquired data and indicated that the thin-film switching dynam-(Fig. 2). ics are in accordance to the previously defined NLS model.Slightly asymmetric switching behavior indicates imprint most likely caused by the electrode interfaces. The small in-crease of switched polarization from 25◦C to 105◦C can be assigned to initial poling of the sample. During our studies, this was observed to be an intrinsic property for many of the Si:HfO2 compositions. The switching behavior was stable up to 145◦C. At 185◦C, degradation of PSW was clearly visible. Based on a more detailed temperature-dependent study of the switching characteristics, a Curie temperature of approximately 400◦C was linearly extrapolated based on remanent polariza-tion values in the range between 150◦C and 205◦C.Furthermore, switching dynamics of the ferroelectric thin films were investigated using the same pulse scheme as de-scribed before. In addition, the WRITE pulsewidths (first and third pulses) were varied from 10 µs to 100 ms. Since the RC delay of the measurement setup was in the range of microsec-onds, no pulses shorter than 10 µs had been applied. The READ pulses (second and fourth pulses) had a constant amplitude and width of ±3 V and 10 µs, respectively. Switching dynamics are reported in terms of normalized switched polarization versus WRITE pulsewidth (Fig. 3).The fact that the thin-film layers are only 10 nm in thickness further supports the hypothesis that the switching dynamics are dominated by the statistical distribution of nucleation times rather than by domain coalescence.In order to test the retention characteristics of ferroelec-tric thin films, same-state and opposite-state retention tests at elevated temperatures are commonly used [16]. For these measurements, the samples are poled in one of the two possible ferroelectric states and then put into an oven for a certain bake time. In our studies, a bake temperature of 125◦C was used, and the polarization measurements were performed at room temperature. For the first retention tests, the same samples as described in Section II had been used. However, these samples showed strong degradation of the opposite-state polarization, i.e., significant imprint [Fig. 4(a)].For another retention test, samples with larger amounts of incorporated silicon (5.3 mol% SiO2, pulsing ratio 10 : 1, and 10 nm thickness) were annealed at 800◦C in order to achieve larger Pr values and were characterized as described before. These samples showed significantly improved retention char-acteristics, particularly with respect to opposite-state retention1302 IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS, VOL. 33, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2012Fig. 4. Same-state and opposite-state retention tests performed at 125◦C bake times. Sample (a) shows severe degradation of the opposite state, whereas sample (b) has significantly improved retention characteristics and only small degradation of the opposite state up to 20 h of bake time. (c) Endurance tests show a sharp breakdown at voltages above 3 V.[Fig. 4(b)]. Moreover, endurance measurements were carried out by exposing the samples to 106bipolar voltage cycles of different amplitude. Sharp breakdown characteristics can be observed for voltages above 3 V. The increase of switched polarization with cycling can again be attributed to the incre-mental poling of the sample.Compared to state-of-the-art PZT-based FRAM capacitors, which can achieve up to 1014endurance cycles, same-state and opposite-state retentions up to 103h, and stable operation in the range of −40◦C to 125◦C [17], the presented data are not sufficient to claim Si:HfO2 as a replacement of PZT yet. Nevertheless, the exceptional scalability as well as the CMOS compatibility of HfO2-based ferroelectrics should stimulate more extensive research regarding HfO2-based ferroelectrics.IV.",1286
mueller2012.docx,CONCLUSION,"We have investigated polarization switching in 10-nm-thick Si:HfO2 thin films, and stable switching behavior could be observed up to 145◦C. For pulsewidths between 10 µs and 100 ms, measurements indicate that the switching dynamics are mainly governed by nucleation times and their statistical dis-tribution. Furthermore, retention characteristics of those films were tested by same-state and opposite-state retention tests. Our investigations showed that processing and annealing con-ditions of the ferroelectric thin films can significantly influence retention characteristics. Further studies will elaborate on this even further (to be published). Endurance was measured for 106 switching cycles and did not degrade for voltages up to 3 V. In summary, because of the very small layer thickness and due to the fact that HfO2 films can be deposited into high-aspect-ratio geometries, the authors see great potential for Si:HfO2 to enable the development of next-generation 3-D FRAM capacitors. However, future studies will have to verify the stability of the ferroelectric phase for vertical capacitor geometries.",233

For the pulse write/read measurement (see supplementary material),5 a series of write and read trapezoidal voltage pulses with a pulse width of 4 ls, a rising/falling time of 1 ls, and a delay time of 10 ls were applied to the MIM capacitors using a pulse generator (Agilent 81110A) and an internal resistance of 50 X as a shunt resistor [Fig. 1(c)].

When the read voltage is much lower than the coercive voltage, the extracted er (�Ec) is similar to the er obtained from the small signal capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurement (50 mV level) at 2.5 MV/cm where the FE switching effect is minimized.5Meanwhile, the extracted er (�Ec) at or above the coercive voltage in the non-switching pulse write/read measurement is close to the maximum er in the small signal C-V measurement at the coercive voltage, which includes a FE domain switching component due to the voltage bias sweeping. This implies that the FE switching component in the non-switching mode is attributed by FE domain reversal possibly due to the depo-larization effect during large signal measurements.All of the HZO samples were found to exhibit a pinched hysteresis loop before wake-up field cycling (i.e., pristine state, data not shown) and FE properties after 105wake-up field cycling at 2.5 MV/cm. During the wake-up field cycling, a constricted polarization hysteresis becomes more ideal and open due to the redistribution of existing defects such as oxy-gen vacancies.16,17After wake-up field cycling, the HZO sample annealed at 400�C after TiN TE deposition exhibited large 2Pr (48 lC/cm2) and Psw (45 lC/cm2) and low FE Vsat 400�C before TiN TE deposition (2Pr of 6 lC/cm2, Psw of (�1.5 V) compared to those of the HZO sample annealed at 3 lC/cm2, and FE Vsat of �2.0 V). The origin of such a large difference will be discussed in detail later. The HZO sampleannealed at 500�C after TiN TE deposition shows a relatively high FE Vsat (�2.0 V) and leakage current properties while maintaining large 2Pr (52 lC/cm2) and Psw (45 lC/cm2). From these",1000
kim_low_thermal_budget_HZO_APL_2017.docx,results,", it was found that the annealing process at 400�C is required to achieve high 2Pr and Psw and should be performed after TiN TE deposition. Moreover, a TiN TE (90 nm or higher) of sufficient thickness is also required to achieve the large 2Pr and Psw as shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(d). Notably, the obtained FE Vsat is maintained at a constant value regardless of the TiN TE thickness and is lower than that (2.5–3.0 V) of previously reported doped-HfO2 films.7,8 The resulting crystal structures of the various HZO films before and after annealing and with varying TiN TE thick-nesses are examined using an X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab) system via grazing-angle incidence XRD (GIXRD) in the 2h range of 26�–40�with an incidence angle of 0.5�as shown in Fig. 2. Before the measurements, the TiN TEs of all HZO samples are removed using SC-1 (NH4OH þ H2O2) after the annealing process. Because of the structural similarity, it is difficult to distinguish the o-phase from the tetragonal phase (t-phase, space group: P42/nmc) in the GIXRD pattern, so that the HZO peaks centered at �30.5�and�35.5�are assigned to the o(1 1 1) phase and o(2 0 0) phase, which coincides with the FE behavior. The HZO (-1 1 1) and (1 1 1) peaks from the m-phase are centered at �28.5�and�31.5�, respectively.9,18The TiN (1 1 1) peaks from the BEs centered at 36.7�(Ref. 19) are also shown in Fig. 2(a).FIG. 2.

Lett. 111, 242901 (2017)The lack of the peak definition in both the as-deposited HZO films at room temperature and the HZO films annealed at 300�C is interpreted as having an amorphous or nanocrys-talline structure. The HZO films annealed at 400�C or higher before TiN TE deposition on the other hand reveal the forma-tion of both the o-phase and the m-phase during crystalliza-tion. However, the HZO films annealed at 400�C or higher after TiN TE deposition exhibit o-phase formation with inhi-bition of m-phase formation. Assuming a Gaussian shape of GIXRD peaks from these o- and m-phases, the relative ratio of the area of o(1 1 1)/{m(-1 1 1)þo(1 1 1) þ m(1 1 1)} as a function of annealing temperature is estimated from the deconvoluted GIXRD spectra in the 2h range of 27�–33�. The relative ratio of the o(1 1 1) phase in the HZO film annealed before TiN TE deposition was 54.6% when the annealing temperature was 400�C, and it decreased to 45.3%, 42.0%, and 19.9% for annealing temperatures of 500�C, 600�C, and 700�C, respectively. On the other hand, the relative ratio of the o(1 1 1) phase in the HZO film annealed after TiN TE deposition was 100% when the annealing temperature was 400�C or higher. Figure 2(c) shows the variation in the location of the maximum peak in the 2h range of 27�–33�as a function of TiN TE thickness (i.e., mechanical stress). For the case of a 45-nm-thick TiN TE, the maximum peak position was observed near 30.6�. This means that the HZO film was crystallized with a rela-tively high portion of the HZO (0 1 1) peak from the t-phase, centered at 30.8�,20compared to the tetragonal peak presence in other HZO films used in this work. Interestingly, the ten-dency is entirely consistent with our electrical",1073
kim_low_thermal_budget_HZO_APL_2017.docx,results,"as shown in Fig. 1 and Table I. This phenomenon, known as the“capping layer effect,” is related to the mechanical stress from the TiN TE working as a tensile stressor on the HZO film during the annealing process.21–24The mechanical stress is generally divided into two components, namely, an intrin-sic stress due to the film growth process and a thermal stress due to the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the film and its substrate.25By measuring the curvature variations of the 100 mm wafers (Toho FLX 2320-S), the estimated stress becomes larger in accordance with the TiN TE thickness and is induced as tensile stress along the in-plane direction of the HZO film [Fig. 2(b)].

As the TiN TE thickness increases, the HZO peak shifts toward a lower 2h diffraction angle due to the corresponding change in phase composition [Fig. 2(c)]: the orthorhombic to tetragonal ratio increases.Although the presence of TiN TEs during crystallization of doped-HfO2 films, especially Zr-doped films, has been demonstrated to reduce the m-phase fraction, polycrystalline films consisting of a single o-phase have not been achieved in previous reports.6–9,16–24,26A stable pre-existing m-phase cannot be transformed into the o-phase, and a portion of m-phase can be increased as a result of increasing the HZO film thickness or annealing temperature. Because the m-phase causes the degradation of ferroelectricity, inhibition of m-phase formation during the annealing process is the key to obtaining large FE polarization. Therefore, the overwhelming tensile stress generated by annealing the room-temperature deposited TiN TE is required for the crystallization of a sin-gle, non-centrosymmetric o-phase.Figure 3 shows the cross-sectional high-resolution trans-mission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) images of the 10-nm-thick HZO-based MIM capacitor and HZO samples annealed at 400�C before and after TiN TE deposition. The diffraction spots from o(1 1 1), m(1 1 1), and m(-1 1 1) phases of HZO films are marked in fast Fourier transformation (FFT) images (data not shown). The lattice fringes in both HZO films and the directions of diffraction spots from FFT images suggest that amorphous structures are crystallized. For the case of the 10-nm-thick HZO film annealed at 400�C after TiN TE deposition, the o-phase with a crystallographic orientation along the (1 1 1) plane (a length of about 30 nm in the horizontal direction) was obtained. Using the FFT patterns and its reverse images filtered by a mask, the inter-atomic distance (d) of the enclosed area in both HZO films was measured as shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c).

Miko_Uwe_Yurchuk_Fatigue_IRPS_2014.docx,Abstract,"— Novel HfO2-based non-volatile ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs) reveal integration and scaling properties superior to the devices utilizing perovskite-type ferroelectrics. However, until now the switching endurance of only 104 program/erase cycles could be proven. The mechanisms responsible for the cycling degradation have been scarcely studied so far. Therefore, the scope of this paper is to clarify the origin of the cycling degradation in HfO2-based FeFETs. Several possible degradation mechanisms – fatigue of the ferroelectric layer and degradation of the transistor gate stack – are proposed and investigated. The limited endurance properties were found to be linked to the transistor gate stack reliability rather than to the ferroelectric material itself. The gate leakage current measurements and the trapping analyses presented in this paper identified a degradation of the interfacial layer in the gate stack, which in turn is strongly linked to a reduction of ferroelectric memory window.",232
Miko_Uwe_Yurchuk_Fatigue_IRPS_2014.docx,INTRODUCTION,"The ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) is considered as a promising candidate for future non-volatile memory applications [1]. In the FeFET two stable polarization states of a ferroelectric material incorporated into a transistor gate stack are utilized for data storage. The concept of a non-volatile ferroelectric transistor was introduced in the late 50’s of the last century [2]. Its industrial implementation is, however, still missing primarily due to the integration [3] and scaling obstacles [4] associated with conventionally used perovskite-type ferroelectrics (PZT, SBT). The recently discovered ferroelectric properties of HfO2-based thin films [5] overcome these issues. By utilizing ferroelectric Si:HfO2, it is possible to fabricate FeFET devices at a state-of-the-art 28 nm technology node [6]. Low operation voltages (4 – 6 V) and switching times in the range of a few nanoseconds could be demonstrated for these devices [6]. In the first HfO2-based FeFETs, however, the memory window (MW) closes after about 104 – 105 program/erase cycles [7]. FeFETs with conventional ferroelectrics, on the other hand, are reported to withstand up to 1012 program/erase cycles [8]. In order to identify the main cause of the limited endurance in Si:HfO2-based FeFETs we performed an extensive study of their endurance behavior using capacitor and transistor structures. The gate stack structure of the studied ferroelectric transistors is similar to an ordinary high-k metal gate stack, whereas a thicker and crystalline high-k layer exhibits additionally ferroelectric properties. Therefore, the observed endurance degradation can be explained in the context of either reliability aspects of the ferroelectric material or the entire high-k metal gate stack.

The devices were manufactured using a state-of-the-art 28 nm high-k metal-gate technology on 300 mm wafers [6]. Metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) capacitor structures consisting of a Pt (50 nm) /TiN (10 nm)/Si:HfO2 (9 nm)/TiN (10 nm) film stack were fabricated on 300 mm silicon substrates [9]. Both device types included 9 nm thick HfO2 films doped with 4.4 mol% SiO2, known to exhibite the best ferroelectric behavior as evaluated in [9]. 978-1-4799-3317-4/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 2E.5.1Polarization-voltage characteristics of the MFM capacitors were recorded using the aixACCT TF Analyzer 3000 by applying triangular pulses at 1 kHz frequency and measuring transient current response, which is subsequently converted into a polarization hysteresis. The trapping behavior of Si:HfO2 layer within the transistor gate stack was studied with the help of a single-pulse ID-VG technique [10], [11]. This method allows for a more accurate characterization of the amount of charge trapped during the stress time. Since the ID-VG characteristics are measured directly at the rising and falling edges of a stress pulse applied to the gate, the time delay between stressing and sensing is practically eliminated. The threshold voltage(VTH) shift induced by the stress pulse gives a quantitative estimation of the amount of trapped charges. The measurement setup used in this work allowed exploiting pulses with rise/fall transition times of 500 ns. The pulse width was varied between 500 ns and 100 μs. The drain voltage was set to 300 mV in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. The VTH values were extracted using a constant drain current criterion. The interface trap density was analyzed by means of variable base level charge pumping technique [12], [13]. The interfacial traps, located directly at the Si / SiON interface, as well as traps, located within the interfacial SiON layer close to the Si interface, are accessed. The charge-pumping current was induced by applying ac signal of 1 MHz and constant amplitude of 1.8 V to the gate. The base gate voltage (VG BASE) was varied between -2.5 and + 0.5 V, forcing the Si surface to transit from accumulation into inversion.device into the “ON”- and “OFF”-state and reading out the corresponding VTHvalues. A more pronounced MWdegradation was detected for the alternating pulses accompanied by continuous polarization switching, whereas for unipolar pulses only slight shifts in the VTH-values of both memory states were observed. From that we deduce, that the polarization switching itself or mechanisms coupled with alternating pulses aggravate the endurance degradation in Si:HfO2-based FeFETs. -1 100 101 102 103 104 105 101.0OFF state (- 6 V100 ns )(a) VTH (V)0.5VSENSEresidual MW: 0.9 V0.0-0.5ON state ( + 4 V100 ns )MW (V)1.52)20Voltage/SenseStressSense3 V(a) 0.8VC (V)VTH (V)4Initialization//Trapping test(a) 200 nst PULSE VTH1 VTH2 1 kHz1 MHzTime+ 4 V 0 V - 6 V200 ns VTH 1 1 kHz1 s(b) PStress cycles 100.4 initial 1E4 VTH 2 PR (μC/cm PR+/PR- +PRV3 10 5E4 00.0 100 1E5 / VC+/VC- – VC 1000 -10+VC-0.42– PR-2010-1 10 0 101 102 10-0.83 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 10 9 10 10 Number of stress cyclesFigure 3.

We examined the possibility of the gate stack degradation by monitoring the gate leakage current of MFIS-FET devices during program/erase cycling (Figure 4).. An increase in the gate current was detected after 103 cycles, which correlated well with the onset of the MW degradation (Figure 1).. Gate leakage current induced during endurance stress was verified on devices with varying gate areas and lengths.. The gate leakage was found to scale together with the gate area, which indicates a homogeneous degradation of the gate stack under cycling stress..",445
Miko_Uwe_Yurchuk_Fatigue_IRPS_2014.docx,CONCLUSION,"SIn summary, the endurance behavior of Si:HfO2-based FeFET devices was studied in order to identify the root cause for its limited endurance capability of 104-105 program/erase cycles. The reliability of the transistor gate stack rather than of the ferroelectric layer itself was found to be responsible for the degradation of the ferroelectric memory window with cycling. Increase in the gate leakage current was detected with progressive endurance stress, correlating to a simultaneously appearing degradation of the ferroelectric memory window. Based on the charge trapping analyses the interfacial SiON layer was identified as the main reliability concern within the gate stack. The deteriorated insulating properties of the interfacial layer are held responsible for the decrease of the ferroelectric memory window with cycling. Optimization of the operation conditions or/and gate stack structure is required to improve the endurance properties.",178

The dependence on the HfO2 thickness within the 30 to 3 nmrange revealed that the ferroelectric properties decrease rapidly below a critical thickness. In the ultra-thin HfO2 region, methods such as higher Y doping or metal capping annealing were required to fur-ther stabilize the ferroelectric phase. These methods could be used to enhance the switchable polarization (Psw) to 35 lC/cm2in 5 nm- and 10 lC/cm2in 3 nm-thick Y-doped HfO2. This paper indi-cates that HfO2 ferroelectricity is scalable even in the ultrathin region. Published by AIP Publishing.https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5017094Ultrathin ferroelectric films are required for high-density ferroelectric random-access memory (FeRAM)1,2 and non-volatile resistive memory with ferroelectric tunnel-ing junctions (FTJs).3–5However, the spontaneous polariza-tion of ferroelectric films tends to degrade as the thickness is scaled down due to intrinsic size effects,6,7interfacial mechanical stresses,8,9chemical effects,10and potentially increased intrinsic depolarization field effects11–13from unscreened charges at electrode interfaces. Therefore, the thickness dependence of the ferroelectric properties is of vital importance with regard to both materials science and practical applications.Since the discovery of ferroelectric HfO2, well-behaved ferroelectric properties have been demonstrated in polycrys-talline HfO2 films by doping them with cations (Y, Sr, Al, Si, Ge, Gd, or Zr)14–20or anions (N).21Since HfO2 is fully compatible with conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes and can be manufactured using common atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), or physical vapor deposition (PVD) methodologies, it may prove superior to traditional perov-skite ferroelectric materials with regard to applicability to ferroelectric devices. Scaled ferroelectric field-effect-transis-tors (FeFETs) with thin ferroelectric HfO2 layers have been fabricated using 28 nm22,23and 22 nm24technology node metal gate/high-k CMOS processes. It is thought that the fer-roelectricity in HfO2 originates from one of the orthorhom-bic phases (Pca21). This is not the ground state but rather is a metastable phase of HfO2. Therefore, it is expected that the resulting ferroelectricity can be influenced by external condi-tions such as stress,25–27doping,17,28thermal treatment,29,30 and film thickness.25,30,31It has been reported that decreasing the film thickness or particle size of HfO2 or structurally sim-ilar ZrO2 stabilizes high symmetric phases more than mono-clinic ones due to the lower surface energies in high symmetric phases.32–34However, most studies have focused on relatively thick ferroelectric HfO2 regions (>6 nm).

We unambiguously demonstrate stable ferroelectric properties in 3 nm-thick Y-doped HfO2 via pulsed polariza-tion current measurements.

The Y2O3 plasma power was controlled for adjusting the Y doping concentra-tion, while that of HfO2 was fixed to 80 W in all of the films. The atomic concentration of Y was estimated via x-ray pho-toelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Most of the films were proc-essed via post-deposition annealing (PDA) in N2 at 600�C for 30 s. However, the 4 nm and 3 nm samples used a PDA temperature of 650�C to enhance film crystallization. The HfO2 film thickness was measured via x-ray reflectivity (XRR). Au was deposited via vacuum evaporation through astencil mask to make a top electrode (TE) with an �43 lm radius. Samples that were processed by post-metallizationannealing (PMA) included a top TiN layer (�25 nm) depos-ited via rf sputtering, before they were subject to the previ-ously discussed PDA thermal annealing process.Ferroelectric properties were measured using polarization-voltage (P-V), current-voltage (I-V), and the double pulse mea-surements using a ferroelectric analyzer (FCE-1A, TOYO Corporation). A schematic of the sample structure and mea-surement configuration is shown in Fig. 1(a). Polarization was measured using P-V and double-pulse measurements five times and averaged. The first poling process was ignored in the P-V measurement. No field cycling was used in these measure-ments. Figure 1(b) shows both typical P-E and I-E measure-ment",1324

Torium_3nm_Y_HfO2_APL_2018.docx,results,"from 3 nm-thick HfO2 films are shown in Fig. 2(b). Compared to perovskite ferro-electrics,40the leakage current is well suppressed in the 3 nm HfO2 layer. This can be attributed to the fact that the HfO2 has a large barrier height with both Au and Ge. Although the P-V result includes a hysteresis loop, it is narrow and slanted.Therefore, the first recorded current peak (IPþC) includes both polarization switching and capacitor charging currents, while the third current peak (IC) includes only the capacitor charg-ing current (no polarization occurs during the second pulse). Thus, the polarization switching current (IP) can be estimated from the difference between IPþC and IC. Figure 2(d) shows the double pulse measurement result from a 3 nm-thick HfO2 layer. The Psw value is estimated to be �2.8 lC/cm2based on integrating the IP. This is substantially comparable to the value obtained from the P-V curve. In addition, an ultrathin paraelectric Y2O3 measurement is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2(d), in which exactly the same currents are shown for two pulses with no corresponding IP curve. This further sup-ports the idea that the current difference in the double pulses originates from ferroelectric polarization switching. Thus, fer-roelectricity in a 3 nm-thick Y-doped HfO2 layer has beenTherefore, it is difficult to determine whether it stems from confirmed directly.ferroelectric characteristics.

The Psw obtained from the P-V hysteresis loop is �3.0 lC/cm2for 3 nm Y-doped HfO2 with the same Y concentration as a 30 nm layer. Since leakage current in thin films is intrinsically related to the P-V curve, double pulse measurements help to characterize the ferroelectric propertiesThe thickness dependence of Psw in 30 nm to 3 nm Y-doped HfO2 films prepared with a fixed Y doping concen-tration of 0.53 at. % is summarized in Fig. 3(a).

The high symmetric phase peak consists primarily of three phases: orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic (o/t/c), which are difficult to distinguish from each other.14,21,30We can define the high symmetric phase ratio (ro/t/c) using ro/t/c ¼ Io/t/c/(Io/t/c þ Im11-1 þ Im111) in the diffraction intensities in 27�–33�. The film thickness dependence of ro/t/c is shown in Fig. 3(c). This quantity also exhibits a critical thickness around 8 nm. Figure 3(d) indicates the relationship between Psw and ro/t/c below 8 nm. The Psw reduction in the ultrathin region may result from decreases in the ferroelectric phase.Since interfacial effects should be more significant in thinner films, an internal driving force might be needed to recover their ferroelectric properties. Therefore, the effects of doping concentration and annealing methods on the crys-talline structure and ferroelectric properties of 5 nm Y-doped HfO2 were investigated. Either higher Y doping or PMA processing was expected to promote the high symmetric phase. The 5 nm-thick HfO2 in Fig. 3 exhibits a significantly reduced Psw of approximately 8 lC/cm2. Increasing the Y doping concentration to 1.51 at. % increases the Psw to approximately 24 lC/cm2, as shown in Fig. 4(b). When the PMA process with TiN capping is applied, no significant increase in the high symmetric phase is noted via XRD [Fig. 4(a)]. However, Psw improves significantly to 35 lC/cm2, as shown in Fig. 4(b). It is inferred that higher Y doping increases the portion of both the ferroelectric phase and the non-ferroelectric high symmetric phase. In Fig. 4(b), both PDA and PMA samples exhibit asymmetric Ec values, which may stem from a voltage polarity dependent asymmetric voltage drop in the pþ-Ge substrate. In addition, the differ-ence between the work functions of Au and pþ-Ge in PDA samples is larger than that between TiN and pþ-Ge in PMA samples. These are likely reasons for the asymmetric P-V curve shown in Fig. 4(b). Furthermore, the average Ec isreduced in the PMA sample. This might be due to a lack of interfacial layer formation during the PMA process (data not shown).The 5 nm-thick film requires a large driving force toward the ferroelectric phase in order to maintain ferroelec-tric polarization comparable to that of a thicker film. The properties of the 3 nm-thick Y-doped HfO2 film were investi-gated by changing the Y doping concentration and annealing method. Figure 4(c) shows a double pulse measurement of a 3 nm Y-doped HfO2 film with a Y concentration of 1.51 at. %. The Psw increases to �10 lC/cm2in the 3 nm-thick HfO2 film, demonstrating that ferroelectricity can be scaled down to the ultrathin region. Figure 4(d) summarizes the Y con-centration dependence of Psw in 3 nm HfO2 films prepared via PDA and PMA and shows that application of PMA to a 3 nm film is not as effective as using a 5 nm film with regard to maintaining a high Psw.Figure 5(a) shows the dependence of Psw on the thick-nesses of samples produced via PMA and PDA processes. High Psw values are demonstrated with layers as thin as 5 nm. A sharp drop in Psw is observed with the 3 nm film, which implies that other effects may destabilize the ferro-electric state in the ultrathin region below 5 nm. The relation-ship between Psw and ro/t/c is plotted in Fig. 5(b) for different HfO2 thicknesses and both PDA and PMA processes. A 5 nm film prepared via a PMA process exhibits a high Psw under a high ro/t/c. This is the same trend as is observed with thicker films. On the other hand, a 3 nm film exhibits a weaker rela-tionship between Psw and ro/t/c. A combination of a high ro/t/c and low Psw is shown in Fig. 5(b) for a 3 nm Y-doped HfO2 device. It is inferred that the low Psw in 3 nm HfO2 might stem from two causes. One potential cause is that more regions may remain amorphous in the 3 nm film because it is difficult to crystallize thinner films. The other is that morephases might transfer from orthorhombic to tetragonal when102902-4Tian et al.Appl. Phys. Lett. 112, 102902 (2018)FIG. 4. (a) GIXRD",1156

Further study of the depolarization field effect is in progress.In summary, ultrathin ferroelectric HfO2 films as thin as 3 nm have been unambiguously demonstrated. A rapid Psw decrease below a critical thickness of approximately 8 nm was observed upon systematically testing the thickness depen-dence of HfO2 ferroelectricity.

As already mention in the main manuscript, for characterization of the defects in the HfO2 layer the thermally stimulated depolarization current technique (TSDC) is applied. Initially, the sample is polarized at 380°C with an applied electric field and rapidly cooled down while the same electric field is still utilized to freeze possible diffused charges in their local and energetic positions. During slow heating with 0.2 K/s the depolarization current is determined suggesting S4 two current maxima at about 290 °C and 320°C. For peak separation the thermal cleaning method was applied. The relaxation current peak at 350 °C was solely measured by poling the sample at 350 °C, cooling it down to 250 °C while applying the same poling voltage and holding the temperature without application of a bias voltage to allow relaxation of charges with lower activation energy for 800 s (Figure SI 8a). The current peak at 275 °C was separated by poling at only 200°C, which does not allow charges with higher activation energy to move (Figure SI 8b). The activation energies were determined by using the initial rinse method as 0.45 – 0.51 eV (Figure SI 8c) and 1.23 – 1.46 eV (Figure SI 8d) depending on the applied poling voltage. This function was fitted to the measurement data for extraction of the amount of mobile charge carriers per volume for both peaks (Figure SI 7e and f).

Figure1 a shows the manifestation of both wake-up and fatigue in the polari-zation hysteresis whereas Figure 1 b depicts the evolution of Pr throughout the course of continuous fi eld cycling. Besides the aforementioned changes in the polarization–voltage ( P – V ) hysteresis (loop opening and Pr increase followed by a decrease in Pr ), the slopes of the saturated hysteresis branches hint at changes in relative permittivity of the fi lm. These changes become even more apparent when measuring the small-signal capacitance as a function of applied bias voltage.

Inter-estingly, the minimal relative permittivity εr,min outside these regions, which represents only the dielectric contributions (no domain walls present), exhibits a steady decline from around 33 to 27. Since this value is coupled to the phases present in the polycrystalline fi lm (Figure 1 c), the question arises whether phase fractions in the bulk and/or at the electrode interfaces are subject to a continuous change during fi eld cycling. For com-parison with the data in Figure 1 a,b, different hafnia phases with their corresponding relative permittivities are shown in Figure 1 d. From the change in these values, the trend in rela-tive permittivity seems to suggest a change from predominantly tetragonal/cubic phases toward predominantly orthorhombic/monoclinic phases. It should be noted, however, that a signifi -cant polarization is still present in the fi lm even after the εr,mindropped to 27. Moreover, judging solely from published X-ray diffractograms of this sample, [ 3,17 ] a predominantly monoclinic to orthorhombic character can be inferred for the pristine case.

To elucidate the origin of these changes in permittivity, impedance spectroscopy was performed. Impedance spectros-copy provides the potential to identify structural inhomogenei-ties and their evolution via frequency-dependent small-signal measurements of the complex impedance Z (Z = Z′ −Z′′). [ 18 ]Bulk ceramics, for which this technique is frequently used, are often represented by parallel arrangements of a capacitance Cand a resistance R (an RC element) to account for the dielec-Figure 1. a) Hystereses of polarization P (dotted lines) and relative permittivity εr (solid lines) for the three different regimes: pristine (0 cycles), during wake-up (1000 cycles), and during fatigue (215 000 cycles); b) the evolution of remanent polarization Pr and minimum rela-tive permittivity εr,min versus number of switching cycles; c) a bright-fi eld STEM image of the complete fi lm stack; and d) literature values of εr for the ferroelectric (FE) orthorhombic (O) Pca2 1and the paraelectric mono-clinic (M) P2 1 /c , tetragonal (T) P4 2 /nmc , and cubic (C) Fm3m phases.

In series with this RC element, an additional resistance contribution is usually included to rep-resent uneliminated resistances of the electrodes, the elec-trode interfaces, the cables/contacts, and parasitic elements of the measurement setup. In the Supporting Information S1, a more exhaustive description of this very basic equivalent cir-cuit and its refl ection in the frequency-dependent behavior of the measured impedance is provided. In contrast to mm-thick ceramics, [ 18 ] grain boundaries are not expected to necessitate a second RC element in series to the fi rst one. As Figure 1 c shows, grains span the whole fi lm thickness and should, from a physical point of view, give rise to an RC element in parallel to the RC element of the grains. However, from a mathematical point of view, the two parallel resistances and two capacitances could be condensed into one R and one C , respectively. A unique best fi t for the two R and two C elements is impossible as it is an underdetermined system. Thus, also for thin fi lms, the mod-elling strategy does not change and series arrangements of RC elements are primarily used and then later on assigned a phys-ical meaning in all conscience. Differences in interface and bulk properties, for example, can explain the necessity of two or more RC elements in series.

It can be explained by a TiO xN yinterfacial layer formed during the deposition and subsequent annealing pro-cess [ 25–27 ] or a partial oxidation of the Ti adhesion layer below the Pt pad. Despite the high ratio of roughness to thickness anticipated for an interfacial TiO xN y, this electrode-like layer does not require a CPE for a proper fi t. Existence of an interfa-cial TiO xN yelectrode interfacial layer of ≈1 nm thickness would result in εr≈ 6 for all three stages of fi eld cycling. The scenario of an interfacial layer with such a low permittivity combined with a high uniformity in dielectric and resistive properties is, thus, unlikely. Instead, assuming a layer thickness of ≈10 nm as would be the case for a partially but uniformly oxidized TiN or Ti layer, the permittivity would be around 60, which is in the range of what has been reported for TiO 2 . [ 28 ] Comparing the remaining parameters to the actual fi lm, we see that the high resistance R1 together with a capacitance C1≈ 1 nF (resulting εr≈ 30) is exactly expected from the capacitor geometry and the bulk of the thin fi lm. Thus, the second RC -like element has also to be in a thickness range of an interfacial-like layer, but still possesses notable insulating properties with R2≈ 10 5 –10 7Ω.

Figure3 summarizes the equivalent circuit with extracted fi t parameters at different stages of fi eld cycling and the concluded counterparts for each element in the physical fi lm stack. From this overview, some trends can be identifi ed: 1. The resistance of the electrode-like layer ( R3 , C3 , R4 ) does not change substantially. A drop of the capacitance occurs during the wake-up stage. No CPE was needed to fi t the data. 2. The capacitance C1 of the bulk layer remains nearly constant during wake-up, but drops by 20% during fatigue. A look at Figure 1 a reveals the problem arguing with these values: At 0 V, they are superimposed by domain-wall contributions (peaks of the butterfl y like curve). Moreover, impedance spectroscopy is not able to account for the evolution of the exceedingly large R1 .

The second RC -like element consists of a fi nite resistance R2 and a constant-phase element (CPE) Q2 , which can be con-sidered as a nonideal capacitance. A wealth of potential sources for such nonideal capacitance behavior have been found previ-ously including fi lm roughness [ 18 ] as well as inhomogeneities in resistivity and/or permittivity (distributed in-plane and/or normal to it), [ 19–24 ] which are all possible explanations for pre-sent sample. Finally, the third RC element is given by another ideal capacitance C 3and a resistance R 3on the order of 100 Ω, which is similar to the series resistance R 4. Thus, it is likely that this third RC element is more refl ective of a nonideal electrode than of a real capacitance, and it therefore likely stems from the interface of TiN to HfO 2 or imperfect electrode-behavior of sistance degradation of this thickest layer by at least one order of magnitude for the fatigued sample. 3. The dielectric interfacial layer is subject to notable changes of both resistance and permittivity. Its resistance (both the R2 and the real Q2 contribution) increases during wake-up, which hints on a reduction in the number of defects, but it then drops by two orders of magnitude during fatigue. Interestingly, n (exponent of the constant phase element) in-creases continuously from about 0.87 via 0.91 to 0.93, which represents a decrease in inhomogeneity. These",438

Through observation of multiple regions in each sample, all three samples are found to be polycrystalline containing orthorhombic and monoclinic grains of various sizes, including many grains that span the entire fi lm thickness in the direc-tion of growth (such as in Figure 1 d). Phase fractions are determined by identifying phases in a region with high magni-fi cation images and measuring the grain areas from lower mag-nifi cation images. An example of this process is included in the Supporting Information S6. Nine regions in both the pristine and woken-up samples and eight for the fatigued are suitable for phase fraction measurement. From pristine to woken-up to fatigued stages of fi eld cycling, the presence of the monoclinic phase decreases from roughly 90% to 20% and fi nally to 10%, respectively. The remaining regions are all orthorhombic. The STEM phase measurements have estimated error of ±10% to the reported phase fractions (limited by STEM sampling and challenges in measuring area due to grain overlap, localized tilting, etc.). Hence, the phase fractions of the woken-up and fatigued samples are within error of each other. Measurement of phase fraction using a histogram “counting” method by tal-lying the zone-axis/phase combinations from the different regions yields phase fractions which are in good agreement with the values and trends of the area measurements. Further information on this alternative measurement are presented in Supplementary Information S6. Though the above phase frac-tion assessments approach the limits of what STEM can pro-vide in terms of statistics, it remains a competitive and realistic approach especially without easy alternative at hand.

Lastly, it is worth noting that while the polarity of each orthorhombic grain Figure 3. Film stack with corresponding equivalent circuit and model parameters used to fi t the impedance spectra presented in Figure 2 . Rela-tive standard deviations of all fi t parameters are 10 −4 or below.(1000 cycles), and fatigued (after onset of fatigue, see Figure 1 b; 215 000 cycles) states to gain insight into any changes in struc-ture that occur with fi eld cycling. These numbers of cycles were chosen in compromise between a best possibly saturated hys-teresis (amount of domains taking part in the switching) and low enough fi eld to avoid an early dielectric breakdown of the lab-scale capacitor stack. The incoherent imaging afforded by high-angle annular dark-fi eld (HAADF)-STEM enables direct visualization of atomic arrangements, which is suffi cient to distinguish crystal structures. While STEM is limited in its sampling capabilities, it is uniquely situated over conventional techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) to address changes in HfO 2 structure with fi eld cycling. Since the target regions in the present sample are cycled HfO 2 areas beneath top electrode pad of a few hundred µm width, they are spatially too small for common XRD without special microspot optics. The use of pad-diameters in the millimeter or centimeter range is hampered was not sampled individually in this work, it is a safe inference that many of the orthorhombic grains generated by fi eld cycling here are polar. The Pr increased with cycling suggesting genera-tion of polar grains, and polar orthorhombic grains have been previously isolated in these fi lms. [ 17 ] In addition to changes in bulk structure, complex changes particular to the interfacial HfO 2 layers occur with fi eld cycling. For the pristine Gd:HfO 2 , some grains exhibit a noticeable transition into tetragonal phase directly adjacent to TiN elec-trodes ( Figure4 a). These regions are regularly between half a unit cell to several unit cells thick and they abruptly relax into the bulk monoclinic or orthorhombic phase. These regions are expected to be stabilized by and relate to the defect concentra-tion and strain environment at the interfaces as will be further considered in the",551

In contrast to the pristine sam-ples, woken-up (Figure 4 b) and fatigued (Figure 4 c) Gd:HfO 2 samples exhibit changed and possibly diminished interfacial tetragonal regions, and their presence is often more subtle as they commonly retain some of the symmetry and spacing of the bulk grains. More STEM images of the interfaces can be found in the Supporting Information S5. Changes in this interface 1600173 (4 of 7)wileyonlinelibrary.com© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAdv. Electron.Mater.2016, 2, 1600173www.MaterialsViews.comwww.advelectronicmat.defi t, which suggests the absence of such a layer. Furthermore, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) found oxygen in the ≈10 nm thick Ti adhesion layer beneath the Pt electrode (Sup-porting Information S9), suggesting partial but uniform oxida-tion of the Ti into TiO x. Thus, impedance spectroscopy suggests that the equivalent circuit elements R3 , C3 do not stem from a thin interfacial TiO xN ylayer and EELS shows oxidation of the Ti adhesion layer into TiO x. More importantly, interfacial changes do occur in the thin dielectric layer comprising circuit elements R2 and Q2 , and these changes originate from a strained and defective dielec-tric interfacial layer of tetragonal HfO 2 . The tetragonal phase and the related strained region appear to change and diminish during fi eld cycling. Impedance spectroscopy reveals that the resistance of this layer increases during wake-up (both in R2 and Q2 contribution), although the thickness decreases. This hints on a reducing number of defects in the layer counter-acting and surpassing the effect of physical thickness reduction. Defects can enhance both the charge carrier transport through and the injection of carriers into the dielectric fi lm. [ 29–31 ] This was shown in earlier studies for similar fi lms. [ 11 ] Adjacent to an oxidized electrode, these defects are likely to be charged oxygen vacancies (O ions scavenged from the HfO 2 fi lm). The nonuni-form lateral distribution of this tetragonal, defect-rich interface layer in the pristine sample, explains the observed constricted hysteresis, which is known to result from internal bias fi elds (for a detailed illustration, see Supporting Information S8). [ 12 ] A uniform charge accumulation at one electrode can result in a so-called imprint, [ 13,32,33 ] as was observed by Lomenzo et al. [ 7 ] for a pristine Si:HfO 2 sample with TaN electrodes. Since oxygen vacancies stabilize the tetragonal compared to the monoclinic bulk phase, [ 3 ] the result of tetragonal regions being defect-rich and thus, charged regions is plausible. A recent simula-tion approach [ 11 ] and other studies on hafnia [ 34,35 ] also support a redistribution of interfacial oxygen vacancies during fi eld Figure 4. Tabulated monoclinic (M) and orthorhombic (O) phase frac-tions measured from the pristine, woken-up, and fatigued samples together with corresponding remanent/maximum polarization Pr / Pmax values. HAADF-STEM images show that the interfacial HfO 2 layer under-goes complex changes in interfacial strain and phase presence with fi eld cycling, including some reduction of the presence of the tetragonal phase in the cycled (woken-up and fatigued) samples compared to the pristine. Lattice parameter maps from these regions further highlight the complex interface environments and assist in visualizing strain and phase pres-ence (color-scale ranges set manually to better visualize details). structure with cycling is likely driven by defect redistribution and phase change/orientation change of grains which both alter the strain environment and occur with fi eld cycling.

LeBeau_Uwe_Miko_Structural_changes_Cycling_Endurance_AEM_2016.docx,Discussion,"Combining the electrical and structural fi ndings, the following pictures of interfacial effects and bulk effects that change with fi eld cycling can be identifi ed. Beginning with the electrode-like layer (circuit elements R3 , C3 , and R4 ), existence of an inter-facial TiO xN ylayer with a high ratio of surface to roughness would necessitate inclusion of a CPE element to properly fi t the impedance data. This, however, is not needed for the current cycling in similar fi lms. Moreover, a templating effect by the pre-deposited crystalline TiN electrode on the anneal of amor-phously deposited Gd:HfO 2 fi lms should be considered. During the subsequent anneal, the HfO 2 likely starts crystallizing beginning at the electrode interfaces with a structure more compatible to the cubic TiN lattice which then relaxes after the strain relaxes away from the interface. Evidence of an orienta-tion relationship was found in STEM, and can even be seen in the pristine sample in Figure 4 . Moreover, fi rst principles studies have explored the nuances of formation of higher sym-metry phases (i.e., orthorhombic, ferroelectric orthorhombic, and or tetragonal), fi nding that strain and surface energy effects play a crucial role in stabilizing them over the monoclinic phase. [ 2,36,37 ] The presence of an interfacial layer that is involved in the wake up process is consistent with recent electrical work on Hf 1-xZr xO 2 . [ 9,10,38 ] Finally, for the bulk of the fi lms (circuit elements C1 and R1 ) a transformation from monoclinic to orthorhombic phase HfO 2 is found. Only 10% of the grains were orthorhombic in the pristine sample, but remanent and maximum polarization are found to be 40% and 70% of the value after 1000 cycles, respectively (see Figure 4 ). This strongly suggests that part of the transfor-mation already took place during the very fi rst P – V measure-ment (see Supporting Information S7 for further insights into Adv.

[ 2 ] reported that 1 MV cm −1 reduces the ground state energy (not the initially constricted P – V hysteresis. The fatigue regime is characterized by an increase in the bulk defect concentration, the barrier) of the FE phase by around 10 meV. The effect on the barrier can, thus, be expected to be in the same order of magni-tude. The redistribution of oxygen vacancies from the interface into the bulk is expected to result in an additional leverage to surmount the energy barrier. Leakage current measurements indicate an increasing amount of bulk defects in the layer with fi eld cycling. With the applied methods, it cannot be explic-itly determined if these defects act as pinning centers for the domains and consequently induce fatigue, but there is a corre-lation of the onset of fatigue and the leakage current increase similar to what has been demonstrated for Sr:HfO 2 . [ 11 ] As a fi nal note, this work further stresses the importance of optimizing processing conditions to yield interfacial layers that contribute minimally to wake-up and fatigue effects. Previously, Hoffmann et al. [ 3 ] pointed out the structural (certain extent of orientation relationship, lateral grain size confi nement, nuclea-tion sites during crystallization of HfO 2 , maybe strain) and chemical role (oxygen is scavenged from HfO 2 and resulting vacancies destabilizing the monoclinic phase) of the electrode for the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase. Schenk et al. [ 12 ] examined internal bias fi elds similar to what was found in con-ventional ferroelectrics and concluded that similar routes could be used to prevent their formation, which include: • fi nding proper annealing conditions; • carefully adjusting the stoichiometry of HfO 2 regarding O and dopant content; • use of inert electrodes. which is proposed to give rise to domain wall pinning. 5.",701

Polarization hystereses were recorded at a frequency of 1 kHz. A triangular large-signal voltage excitation was used with a modulated 10 kHz small signal of 150 mV amplitude to record the capacitance–voltage characteristics. Impedance spectroscopy was conducted with an HP 4294A (Agilent Technologies). Small-signal amplitude was the same as for the C – V measurements and a point averaging factor of 25 was applied. Details about the choice of the equivalent circuit as well as about the fi tting procedure can be found in the Supporting Information S2 and S3. Cross-section samples for STEM were prepared using either an FEI Quanta Focused Ion Beam or an FEI Helios nanolab 600i. STEM images were recorded with a probe-corrected FEI Titan G2 60–300 kV operated at 200 kV with a beam current of ≈80 pA, a probe semiconvergence angle of either 13.5 or 19.6 mrad, and an HAADF detector inner semiangle of 77 mrad. STEM images were acquired and processed with the RevSTEM technique including 20–40 1024 × 1024 pixel frames with a 2 µs pixel −1 dwell time and a 90° rotation between each successive frame.

PhysRevB.93.041423 Polarization coupling transition in	BaTiO3-PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 ferroelectric bilayers.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Ferroelectric multilayers and superlattices provide a path-way to engineer novel materials with enhanced functional properties in respect to the properties of single-layer ma-terials [1–6]. Utilizing several oxide materials with differ-ent ferroelectric properties and crystal lattice parameters to build a multilayer system can be beneficial for design of complex internal electric fields and epitaxial strain profiles, which control ferroelectric and dielectric properties of a new heterostructure [7]. Most studies of ferroelectric heterostruc-tures were focused on ferroelectric-paraelectric systems. All-ferroelectric multilayer materials, however, provide even more flexibility for tailoring the polarization profile inside the layersness considering that the polarization coupling strength may be different in thick- and thin-layer films because the thickness of the layers can become comparable to the space-charge region width in thinner-layer heterostructures. In thicker multilayer films, the coupling can become weak assuming the free charges at the interface provide sufficient compensation to screen the internal electric fields and maintain a large polarization gradient between the layers. The goal of our computational study is to investigate the thickness dependence of polarization coupling strength in BaTiO3/PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 ferroelectric bilayer in order to better understand the coupling phenomena in ferroelectric multilayers and to guide design of multilayer materials with desirable properties.providing great opportunities for enhancing and introducing properties that cannot be found in other systems.

The layer-by-layer switching enables tail-to-tail and head-to-head polarization domain configurations, which have distinct ferroelectric and dielectric properties, multiplying the number of possible switchable states in this system.Polarization gradient and concomitant depolarizing fields in antiparallel ferroelectric domains or layers of different ferroelectric materials can be compensated, at least partially, by an increase of free-charge carrier density at the interfaces. The free interface charges are predicted to occupy the interface space-charge region as a result of semiconductor band bending of oxide layers under strong internal depolarizing fields [10,12]. These predictions have been made considering fer-roelectric oxides as wide-band-gap semiconductor materials [10,12–14]. The width of the interfacial space-charge region and, consequently, the polarization coupling strength depend on a delicate balance between depolarizing fields and the free-charge carrier distribution near the interface [10,12,15,16]. This balance should be a function of a ferroelectric layer thick-*alexei-grigoriev@utulsa.eduThe modeling of a ferroelectric system that includes space-charge regions can be undertaken using a combination of thermodynamic Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) and semiconductor theories [10]. A one-dimensional model of a ferroelectric material can be described by the two differential equations that couple the electric polarization P and the electrostatic potential ϕ [17–19]:− εbε0d2ϕ dx2 + dP dx= ρ(ϕ) ,(1)αP + βP3+ γ P5− g d2P dx2 + dϕ dx= 0,(2)where εb and ε0 are background and free-space permittivities, respectively; and α, β, γ , and g are free-energy expansioncoefficients. The first equation represents the Gauss law, andthe second equation is a result of minimization of the LGD free-energy expansion. The free-energy expansion coefficients can be renormalized to include the effects of epitaxial strain [20].

For these calculations, the BTO polarization pointed toward the bilayer interface and the PZT polarization pointed away from it. The electric fields introduced by the polarization gradient bend the electronic energy bands strongly enough for the top of the valence band to cross the Fermi level. This band bending leads to a sharp increase of the concentration of free-charge carriers near the BTO/PZT interface. The charge carriers are holes for the chosen polarization configuration, but they will change to electrons if polarization direction is reversed at the interface. The relative width of the space-charge region is noticeably larger in the thinner bilayer. Free charges in the interfacial space-charge region reduce depolarizing fields, which enables large polarization gradients between the layers as a stable configuration of the system. As expected, the screening effect of the interfacial free charges is weaker in thinner films, which leads to stronger depolarizing fields and a smaller stable polarization gradient in thinner layers than in thicker ones.The effectiveness of depolarizing field screening may decrease dramatically when the layers get thinner than the space-charge region width. The electric polarization in the middle of BTO and PZT layers and other polarization coupling related properties are shown in Fig. 2 as a function of ferro-electric layer thickness from 3 to 500 nm. These calculations were done at each thickness for fully relaxed layers and for the layers that were completely strained as if they were grown on SrTiO3 (100) substrate that has a 3.905- ˚A in-plane lattice constant [26–28]. Including strain in calculations is important because the epitaxial strain can modify significantly ferroelectric properties of thin films [29,30]. The BTO andFIG. 1.

In thinner bilayers, the electric polarizations change dramatically, and the BTO-layer polarization becomes almost the same as the polarization of PZT in layers thinner than 15 nm for relaxed and 9 nm for fully strained films. Depolarizing fields in ferroelectric layers increase monotonically with decreasing the film thickness until the fields become almost insensitive to film thickness changes in thinner films [Fig. 2(b)]. Interestingly, we found that the monotonic increase of the depolarizing fields in thicker bilayers is well described by a simple estimate of the field due to charged domain walls of a single-layer ferroelectric material [10]: ED∼= Egap/(qh), where Egap is the band gap of ferroelectric.The free-charge carrier density increases sharply near the BTO/PZT interface resembling a two-dimensional gas of electrons or holes depending on polarization configuration.

The sheet carrier density decreases by 8 to 24 orders of magnitude when the layer thickness decreases from 30 to 15 nm for relaxed and to 9 nm for strained layers. The thickness at which the carrier density starts to increase quickly can be interpreted as the critical thickness of charged interface formation.The polarization contrast between BTO and PZT reduces to 1–2 μC/cm2when the layers are thinner than the critical thickness. This resembles strong polarization coupling behav-ior predicted by the nonlinear thermodynamic model (NLTM) developed for ideal insulating ferroelectric multilayers [31]. A polarization coupling coefficient κ can be used in order to quantify coupling [15]:Eκ�P,(6)D =2εbε0that is just slightly lower than the phase transition temperature of pure PZT. The depolarizing field of 35–40 kV/cm does not change much at temperatures below the transition temperature. As the coupling gets stronger in thinner films, the electric fields inside the layers increase to 200–220 kV/cm in a 100-nm bilayer up to the transition temperature of 633 K, at which both PZT and BTO layers lose their polarization quickly. The BTO layer maintains a relatively large polarization of about 12 μC/cm2until the transition at 633 K. In a 20-nm bilayer, which is just slightly thicker than the thickness of the room-temperature polarization coupling transition, BTO and PZT layers have almost identical polarizations at temperatures above 400 K. The depolarizing field in this thin bilayer decreases nearly linearly with increasing temperature until 582 K. At this temperature the polarizations of the layers decrease sharply to less than 5 μC/cm2, but the polarizations and internal electric fields do not vanish completely even at temperatures above the phase transition temperature of pure PZT. This nonvanishing high-temperature polarization can be due to a polarizing effect of built-in field Ebi ∼ �W/h as a result of the contact potential difference, which continues to affect the thin bilayer even in its paraelectric state.Ferroelectric layers of the BTO/PZT bilayer system can be considered as capacitors in series because of weak coupling and large interface free-charge density [35].

Considering that a large spontaneous polarization is predicted in the BTO layer at temperatures well above the transition temperature of pure BTO, the permittivity enhancement in respect to the permittivity of a single-layer PZT is likely to persist in the bilayer over a broader temperature range beyond the ferroelectric transition of BTO [37,38].

Peide Ye_si_AdvEleMat_2019.docx,INTRODUCTION,"A ferroelectric material has two stable polarization states with different directions, which are switchable by the external electric field, and thus is extensively explored for nonvolatile memory applications. Using ferroelectric field-effect transistors (Fe-FETs) as FET-type ferroelectric memory is a promisingferroelectric memory architecture because of its high density and nondestructive readout.1−4Recently, using a ferroelectric-gated transistor as a negative capacitance field-effect transistor(NC-FET) has attracted tremendous attention as a novel steep-slope device.5−9In both Fe-FET and NC-FET, a ferroelectric(FE) insulator and linear dielectric (DE) insulator bilayer stack10−17is applied as the gate structure. The necessity of such alinear DE layer is because an interfacial oxide layer between thesemiconductor channel and FE insulator is required to improvethe ferroelectric/semiconductor interface and meanwhile provide sufficient capacitance matching if the quasi-staticnegative capacitance (QSNC) concept is applied for the development of NC-FETs.5The QSNC definition was introduced to distinguish between the stabilized NC effect and transient NC effect.18One important fact, which has beenoverlooked in the past several years, is that the FE/DE stack capacitor is fundamentally different from an FE capacitor and DE capacitor in series.18,19Therefore, the complete under-standing of the impact of the DE layer on the ferroelectricproperties of an FE/DE stack is crucial to study of theferroelectric switching mechanism in Fe-FETs and NC-FETs.this study, and Al2O3 is chosen as the linear DE insulator to study the ferroelectric polarization switching in the FE/DE stack. It is well-known that ferroelectric HZO has a thickness-dependent remnant polarization (Pr) at about 10−30 μC/cm.2,22,23 However, a conventional dielectric insulator cannot support such a large charge density. For example, Al2O3 has a typical dielectric constant of 8 and a breakdown electric field less than 1 V/nm.24The calculated charge density at breakdown electric field is about 7 μC/cm2, which is the maximum charge density (Qmax) for ideal Al2O3 to be able to support without breakdown. Note that in reality, this value for Qmax is much smaller. As can be seen, even in ideal case, there is a big gap between the remnant polarization in HZO and the maximum charge density in Al2O3. This fact can also be generally applied to other FE/DE stack systems. Thus, the puzzle and confusion in the field is how can ferroelectric polarization switching happen in an FE/DE stack without sufficient charge balance? Such charge difference can only be explained by introducing the leakage-current and interfacial charges. The impact of leakage current in FE/DE bilayer was previously reported, and the interfacial charging is believed to be important in the ferroelectric switching process by a thermodynamic free energy model.10In FE hafnium oxide systems, the",694

Electron. Mater. 2019, 1, 745−751ACS Applied Electronic MaterialsArticleIn this work, we provide a simple understanding of the ferroelectric polarization switching process in an FE/DE stack by introducing the leakage current through the thin DE layer and only considering the electrostatics. The ferroelectric polarization switching of HZO in the HZO/Al2O3 FE/DE stack is investigated systematically by capacitance−voltage (C−V) and polarization−voltage (P−V) measurements. The thickness of the dielectric layer is found to have determinant impact on the ferroelectric polarization switching of ferroelectric HZO. The suppression of ferroelectricity is observed with thick dielectric layer. In the gate stacks with thin dielectric layers, a full polarization switching of the ferroelectric layer is found possible by the proposed leakage-current-assist mechanism through the ultrathin dielectric layer. It is confirmed that the charge needed for ferroelectric polarization switching comes from the leakage current through the thin dielectric layer. Without such leakage current to realize the charge balance, the FE HZO cannot be fully polarized.■",476

The device fabrication process started with the standard solvent cleaning of heavily p-doped Si substrates (resistivity < 0.005 Ω·cm). TiN was deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 250 °C, using [(CH3)2N]4Ti (TDMAT, heated up to 60 °C) and NH3 as the Ti and N precursors, respectively. All TiN layers are metallic and 30 nm thick. Hf1−xZrxO2 film was deposited by ALD at 200 °C, using [(CH3)2N]4Hf (TDMAHf, heated up to 60 °C), [(CH3)2N]4Zr (TDMAZr, heated up to 75 °C), and H2O as the Hf, Zr, and O precursors, respectively. The Hf1−xZrxO2film with x = 0.5 was achieved by controlling the HfO2/ZrO2 cycle ratio of 1:1. The ALD deposition of TiN and HZO was in two separated ALDchambers to avoid cross-contamination. The two ALD chambers areconnected externally by an Ar environment in a glovebox to avoid environmental contamination. After the deposition of type A−D structures, the samples were annealed at 500 °C in N2 environment for 1 min by rapid thermal annealing. Then, Ti/Au top electrodes were fabricated by photolithography, e-beam evaporation, and a lift-off process (capacitor area = 5024 μm2). CF4/Ar dry etching was done to remove top TiN layer for device isolation for type A−C capacitors. Fortype D capacitors, BCl3/Ar dry etching was used to remove the top Al2O3 layer, and CF4/Ar dry etching was used to remove the top and middle TiN layers. All electrical measurements were done at room temperature in a cascade summit probe station. C−V measurement was performed using an Agilent E4980A LCR meter, and P−V measure-ment was carried out using a Radiant RT66C ferroelectric tester.■",659
Peide Ye_si_AdvEleMat_2019.docx,DISCUSSION,"Figure 2(a) shows the C−V measurement of a type A capacitorwith 20 nm Al2O3, from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. Figure 2(b) shows the P−V measurement of the same type A capacitor, showing alinear dielectric characteristic. Both measurements (small signal C−V, dP/dV in P−V) give consistent capacitance values for the type A dielectric capacitor with a capacitance of ∼0.33 μF/cm2 and a corresponding dielectric constant of ∼8. Figure 3(a) shows the C−V measurement of a type B capacitor with 20 nm HZO, from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. The C−V measurement of a type B capacitor shows two signature peaks in the C−V hysteresis loop as the ferroelectric characteristics. The different capacitances at different voltages in C−V are attributed to the different dielectric constant due to the difference in atomic structures in differentferroelectric polarization states. The corresponding dielectricconstants are calculated, as also shown in the right axis. Figure 3(b) shows the P−V measurement of the same type B capacitor,showing a ferroelectric hysteresis loop.Figure 4(a) shows the C−V measurements of type Ccapacitors with 20 nm HZO and Al2O3 from 0 to 20 nm, measured at 10 kHz. The capacitances of type C capacitorsdecrease with thicker Al2O3 as expected. The signature two capacitance peaks due to ferroelectricity in the C−V hysteresisloop decrease and eventually disappear in the 20 nm HZO/20nm Al2O3 stack, suggesting the reduction of ferroelectricity in the thick DE layer and FE layer stack. This feature is even more clearly presented in Figure 4(b), which shows the P−Vmeasurements of type C capacitors with 20 nm HZO andAl2O3 from 4 to 20 nm. The applied voltage ranges are maximized in P−V measurement before the leakage current has essential impacts. The significant decrease of remnant polar-Figure 2.

The C−V measurements and P−V measurements consistently confirm that a thick DE layer can suppress the ferroelectricity in the FE/DE stack. Figure 4(c) shows the P−V characteristics of an FE/DE capacitor with 20 nm HZO and 6 nm Al2O3, measured at different voltage sweep ranges. The coercive voltage and remnant polarization are found to be dependent on the sweep voltage range.To further understand the physics behind the DE layer thickness dependence on the ferroelectricity of the FE/DE stack, a theoretical analysis is provided, as shown in Figure 5. To understand the dynamic process of ferroelectric switching, this process is plotted by a two-step process: before ferroelectric polarization switching and after ferroelectric polarization switching. As is well-known, the ferroelectric polarization switching is atom reposition within the unit cell, so it is always slower than the electron redistribution. Thus, the two-step assumption is valid. For simplicity, it is assumed the FE layer has a dielectric constant of ϵFE (without considering ferroelectric polarization) and a thickness of tFE; the DE layer has a dielectric constant of ϵDE and a thickness of tDE. It also assumes that the FE747 DOI: 10.1021/acsaelm.9b00092ACS Applied Electronic MaterialsArticleFigure 5. Illustration of charge distribution in FE/DE stack in thefollowing conditions.

Type ofcharges: black, ferroelectric polarization; blue, dielectric polarization;red, interfacial trapped charge.So, the C−V and P−E characteristics behave like a linear dielectric insulator. Second, if VFE,init > Vc but tDE is sufficiently thick, the FE layer cannot be fully polarized. As the polarizationswitching happens, VDE increases until VFE reaches Vc, and the polarization process cannot continue. In this case, the total charge in the FE layer (QFE) can be approximated as ϵDE(VTOT −Vc)/tDE, where we have ferroelectric polarization charge (PFE) < Pr and VDE,final = QFE/(ϵDE/tDE). Note that PFE ≅ QFE = QDE if the PFE is significantly larger than the dielectric charge. Such an assumption is made for the simplicity of qualitative",1326

The above understanding of ferroelectric switching process helps to just apply ferroelectric polarization switching (sometimes calls transient negative capacitance effect) to explain the DC enhancement of ferroelectric-gated transistors without invoking the QSNC concept (see Supplementary Section 3).

The suppression of ferroelec-tricity is observed with a thick linear dielectric layer. In the gate stacks with thin dielectric layers, a full polarization switching of the ferroelectric layer is found possible by the proposed leakage-current-assist mechanism through the ultrathin dielectric layer.

Fatigue measurement function of the aixACCT TF Analyzer 2000 system was employed to investigate the polarization switching characteristics of the as-prepared capacitors at room temperature. After measuring an initial polarization-voltage (P-V) hysteresis, the sample was sub-jected to bipolar rectangular-wave voltage pulses of 62.5, 3.0, or 3.5 V at frequencies of 0.1, 1.0, and 10 kHz. The time constant of the measuring circuit is about 1 ls. Thus, the rise-time for the excitation signal is neglectable compared to the pulse widths predefined for three applied frequencies. The changes of hysteresis shape, remanent polarization, and coer-cive voltage invoked by cycling stresses were monitored periodically by dynamic P-V measurements using triangular waves, the voltage amplitude, and frequency of which were fixed at 3.5 V and 1.0 kHz, respectively. Due to the use of high cycling voltages and low frequencies in this study, all measurements were terminated by breakdown before the appearance of degradation in polarization, i.e., fatigue. A study on the fatigue behavior of the Si:HfO2 films will be presented elsewhere.Figure 1 presents the evolution of P-V hysteresis loops under 2.5 V bipolar cycling at 0.1 kHz. For the sample in fresh state, the hysteresis loop is characterized by a clear con-striction and polarity asymmetry of the coercive voltage (Vc). The jVþ voltage asymmetry has been observed in our previous cj (0.84 V) is twice as much as jV�cj.

Schroder_Si_HfO2_wakeup_APL_2013.docx,results,"indicate the switching process follows the nucleation-limited switching (NLS) mechanism, which con-siders that the film consists of regions where the switching develops independently and polarization reversal in each region is limited by nucleation and growth of reversed domains rather than by domain wall motion.17As compared to massive bulks, the actual properties of ferroelectric thin films are strongly influenced by the electrode/ferroelectric interface-related effects. It has been widely accepted that especially charged defects in the nearby interfacial region act as nucleus suppression centers to inhibit the growth of domains of opposite polarity.18Accordingly, we attribute the observation of apparent polarity asymmetric wake-up in co-ercive voltages to significantly non-equivalent bottom and top electrode/ferroelectric interfacial states and the resultant different domain nucleation/growth scenarios.There was microscopic evidence showing that, due to the use of ozone in the ALD process of dielectrics, the bot-tom TiN electrode was partially oxidized and the released N was incorporated into the high-k layer. The latter was expected to result in substantial oxygen vacancies aggre-gated in the bottom interface region. At the top interface, no titanium oxide formation was found. Nitrogen diffusion dur-top electrode deposition resulted in a interfacial ing TiON formation.13,19Recent work of Hildebrandt et al. indi-cates that highly oxygen deficient HfO2�x thin film shows p-type-like conductivity and its band-gap is reduced at the same time.20Therefore, it would be reasonable to consider our Si:HfO2 ferroelectric film in a certain region near the bottom interface as a p-type semiconductor.

As sketched in Fig. 2, the resultant so-called built-in electric field Ebi across the depletion layer is expected to cause local alignment of ferroelectric dipoles. We assume such a pronounced preference of a certain polarization state (i.e., local imprint effect) may be reduced significantly in the top electrode interfacial region due to much less aggregation of oxygen vacancies.In our measurements, the bottom electrode is always being grounded and the external voltage is applied on top electrode. By applying a negative voltage, the built-in field and external field are pointing towards the same direction.

Considering inhibition of opposite domain nucleation at bot-tom interface, we believe that, in the case of positive bias, top electrode interface is the most preferable site for nuclea-tion and growth of new domains anti-parallel to the built-in field.Referring to the model on depletion-assisted nucleation of domains,22the built-in potential is given byEbi ¼ qNdt=e; (1)where q is the electric charge, Nd is the concentration of charge carriers, e is the permittivity of the ferroelectric film, and t is the thickness of the depletion layer.

(2) is same at bottom and top elec-trodes, one finds that much higher concentration of charge carriers at the bottom electrode/ferroelectric interface may account for the apparent polarity asymmetry of the coercive voltages seen in virgin P-V hysteresis loop. Subsequent cyclic switching causes a gradual removal or redistribution of mobile carriers mainly at the bottom interface, resulting in a reduction of the built-in field and de-pining or unlocking of more and more domains participating in polarization switch-ing. The former leads to an increase in negative coercive voltage and the latter leads to an enhancement in remanent polarization. The stability of the positive coercive voltage may be explained in the following way: even the domain pining effect at bottom interface becomes progressively weak during wake-up, top electrode always seems to be the preferable nucleation site for positive bias, and additionally, the defect states at top interface are insensitive to bipolar field cycling.decrease in frequency will accelerate the enhancement in re-manent polarization, and especially, the increase in negative coercive voltage. Again hardly any shift is detected for the positive coercive voltage at various frequencies. Referring to the mechanism suggested for frequency dependent fatigue,23 we believe that time dependent migration/diffusion process of charge carriers in the nearby bottom interfacial region should account for the majority of the frequency impacts on wake-up.Figure 4 displays the dependence of wake-up on the am-plitude of the cycling electrical stress, which represents the strength of driving force for migration/diffusion of the charge carriers. Higher pulse voltage gives rise to faster increases in remanent polarization and coercive voltage. It is worth noting that even the positive coercive voltage exhibits slight wake-ups at 3.0 and 3.5 V as well, indicating removal or redistribution of a small quantity of defect charges driven by very high cyclic fields at top electrode interface.A logarithmic dependence of wake-ups in remanent polarization and coercive voltage on the number (n) of bipo-lar pulse cycles can be observed clearly in Figures 3 and 4.The relationship is given byThe wake-up effect in Si:HfO2 is strongly dependent onmðnÞ ¼ mn¼1 þ AlogðnÞ;(3)the frequency and amplitude of the bipolar cyclic field.

Lederer_Antiferroelectric_Ferroelastic_PSS_2021.docx,Introduction,"Since its discovery [1], ferroelectric hafnium oxide has become of interest for a broad range of integrated devices, like ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs), ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM), ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ), [2-5] as well as piezo- and pyroelectric devices [6, 7], due to its compatibility to standard complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes [8]. Ferroelectric H fO 2 has enabled highly scalable devices in 28 nm [9], 22 nm [10], and 14 nm [11] technology due to its coercive field, layer thickness scalability, and other advantages as compared to conventional ferroelectrics like lead titanate zirconate (PZT) [8, 12]. The metastable ferroelectric (orthorhombic) H fO phase of space group 2P ca21 [13] can be stabilized by e.g. doping [8, 14], stress [15], specific surface area [16], and thermal quenching [4]. In polycrystalline films, other phases might be found alongside the ferroelectric phase.

In addition, another ferroelectric phase of rhombohedral symmetry has recently been reported to occur in epitaxial thin films [17]. During the lifetime of the device, the polarisation-voltage (P-V) hysteresis of the ferroelectric thin film is governed by multiple effects.

Furthermore, internal bias fields (e.g.. due to band alignment) or imprint of the polarization state may affect the hysteresis as well [20].. Especially the wake-up effect is not understood in depth, although many different explanations have been proposed as prospective explanations, however, without giving a concise picture.. Most theories can be assigned to one of the following three models: i) Defect redistribution that reduces internal bias fields and assists domain wall depinning within the layer [21, 22]; ii) defect redistribution and subsequent stabilization of the orthorhombic phase [18, 19, 23, 24]; or iii) ferroelastic switching [25-27].. The stabilization of the orthorhombic phase during wake-up is connected to the field-induced phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic, as being proposed for explaining the antiferroelectric-like (AFE) behavior in highly-doped ZrO [1, 28].. 2 In order to clarify the physical origin of the wake-up effect, we analyse in the following sections the various differences and signatures in the wake-up behavior of H fO , discuss 2 influences resulting from doping, stress, annealing profile, and operating temperature, as well as the resulting implications on the physical origin of the different phenomena.. For characterization and application, two different H fO material stacks are commonly 2 used Figure 1a), namely metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) and metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MFIS) stacks.. Due to the symmetry and absence of parasitic capacitances or semiconductor-based non-linearities, MFM capacitors are generally used to characterize the ferroelectric behavior, directly paving the way to FeRAM and back-end of line (BEoL) integration in FeFETs [29, 30].. On the other hand, MFIS stacks resemble the integration of hafnium oxide based FeFETs in the front-end of line (FEoL).. 2 Differences in the wake-up behavior of hafnium oxide In this article, MFM structures with H fO films of 5 nm and 10 nm thickness doped with 2 various elements (Si, Zr, La) of different concentrations were analysed..",544

Consequently, only two physical mechanisms appear likely to govern wake-up in hafnium oxide, one for transitioning from dielectric and another transitioning from AFE-like behavior. As the initial state of the latter is not fully understood, the origin of AFE-like behavior and wake-up is analyzed. As mentioned above, non-split wake-up could be explained by these two mechanisms as well. Nevertheless, an additional mechanism for this effect cannot be ruled out. 2.2 Origin of antiferroelectric-like behavior In case of classical wake-up, measuring the polarization hysteresis at higher operating temperatures, e.g. for H f 0.5 Zr 0.5 O as shown in Figure 3a, showed an increased splitting of the displacement current peaks as observed for the initial curve. Furthermore, a third peak is emerging This article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedin-between when lowering the temperature, thus resulting in less cycling to achieve full wake-up with lower temperatures. A similar trend is observed for increased dopant concentration (supplementary Figure S4). Here, the wake-up cannot be completed at higher temperatures. Measuring the wake-up behavior at different frequencies shows a clear cycle dependence (see Figure 3b) instead of a time dependence (see supplementary Figure S4). The minor influence of cycling time might be related to the superimposed fatigue effect for high cycle count. Accepted Article Consequently, drift and diffusion processes and therefore defect redistribution and domain wall depinning [18, 21, 31] can be ruled out as underlying mechanisms. Even if these processes would happen only during the domain switching, the temperature dependence is opposing the expected trend. Combined with previously-published data [27] we are able to rule out transitions from the monoclinic phase [18, 19, 23] as well. More details on this are given in the supplementary material. Ferroelastic switching [25-27] and the field-induced phase transition from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic phase [1, 24, 28, 38] would become more pronounced with increasing operating temperature. ZrO films, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest the presence of a first-order phase transition from the tetragonal to the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase as well as a very low difference of about 1 meV in the energy level of both phases [28]. Due to the kinetically suppressed transition from tetragonal to monoclinic [39], the film exhibits anti-ferroelectric properties. Furthermore, a more Hf rich film (e.g. H f 0.5 Zr 0.5 O ) is expected to behave more 2ferroelectric, as the energy level of the orthorhombic phase decreases [28]. As other dopants than Zr as well as surface effects can also stabilize the tetragonal phase, this behaviour can be one of the underlying processes during the AFE-based wake-up. On the other hand, the reported high Curie to 5 0 0 C ) [40-42] of the phase transition in combination with the almost constant P observed during cycling in case of AFE-like wake-up, makes the field-induced phase transition quite unlikely. Furthermore, without redistribution of oxygen vacancies or other defects, common suggestions for the destabilization mechanism of the tetragonal phase are ruled out. On the other hand, transmission Kikuchi diffraction analysis of pristine and post-cycled regions of Si doped H fO with classical wake-up behavior shows an increased out-of-plane 2orientation of the polarization axis after cycling, while the ferroelastic axis decreases in out-of-plane orientation density (see Figure 3c). In consequence, this proves initial presence of ferroelastic switching. Pre-existing orthorhombic phase has recently been confirmed by displacement measurements as well [43]. The stabilization of ferroelectric behavior upon field cycling can be attributed to stress relaxation upon cycling, e.g., by formation of defects like dislocations or changes in the electrical and stress field distribution.

Furthermore, the P increase characteristic for the sudden wake-up also shows a clear Rtime dependence (see Figure 4a), which is expected for electric-field-induced crystallization processes [44]. Combining time and temperature dependence with the evolution of P , an R Accepted Article effective activation energy of 0 .4 50 .0 3 eV could be extracted by visualizing the data in the form of an Arrhenius plot, as displayed in Figure 4b. This value is lower as compared to the activation energies of other materials (1 .3 eV to 3 eV), that are known for electric-field-induced crystallization, like G e S b T e [44, 45]. Note, that the activation energy 2 2 5might differ, as the polarization is further influenced by the pinching of the P-V characteristics and the pyroelectric effect. Since the rapid thermal processing (RTP)-annealed sample is X-ray amorphous (cf. grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) pattern in the supplementary Figure S7), and as-deposited samples do not show this effect (see supplementary Figure S8), it can be concluded that the RTP-annealed sample contains nano-crystallites embedded into an amorphous matrix. Upon field cycling, these nuclei grow (see Figure 4c) and ferroelectricity is emerging, thus explaining the sudden wake-up. 3",572

Here, the following major findings are reported: (i) For the first time electric field-induced crystallization of hafnium oxide into a ferroelectric phase was demonstrated, and an effective activation energy of 0.45 eV was determined. (ii) AFE-related wake-up effects are most likely derived from stress relaxation, e.g. defect generation, during field-cycling. (iii) AFE behavior can be introduced by increased operating temperature. (iv) Defect redistribution, domain wall depining and field-induced phase transitions from tetragonal or monoclinic phase to the orthorhombic phase can all be excluded as the major underlying mechanisms for AFE and classical wake-up in hafnium oxide. (v) The presence of ferroelastic switching in polycrystalline hafnium oxide films was proven and identified as the underlying mechanism for antiferroelectric-like behavior in hafnium oxide. Additionally, means in order to distinguish and to manufacture the various kinds of wake-up, are summarized in Table 1. These findings highlight the importance of stress engineering in ferroelectric hafnium oxide films. Furthermore, the newly discovered field-induced crystallization as well as ferroelastic switching in hafnium oxide enable novel device concepts, new nano-electro-mechanical applications and give relevant insights for the optimization of current devices and processes. 4",336

HfO2 has been widely adopted as the industry standard gate dielectric in logic and memory devices [6]. Recently reported ferroelectric properties in doped HfO2 triggered the interest in application of these materials in ferroelectric memories [7], which may overcome the scaling problem of traditional ferroelectric memories such as PZT. However, up to now, there has been no report addressing the radiation effects to HfO2-based FeRAM devices. Understanding the radiation effect on HfO2 based FeRAM may promote their application in high radiation environments.

Fig.. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of devices with various radiation total doses.. At the pristine state, diffraction peaks from an orthorhombic phase of HfO2 which contributes to the ferroelectricity are observed.. After 5.4 Mrad and 10.8 Mrad radiation, the peak positions and half peak widths are not significantly altered.. No diffraction peaks from other phases emerge.. The little intensity difference may be caused by the variation of sample position between tests.. Therefore, the radiation causes no distinct effect on the crystal structures.. The current density-electric field (J-E) curves of one device before and after radiation are shown in Fig.. 1(b).. The J-E curve was measured by ramping the voltage from 0 V to 3.6 V and then from 0 V to -3.6 V. Polarization switching current is observed at around ±1.1 MV/cm..

huang2017.docx,results,"in better fatigue endurance. This phenomenon can be explained as the sample contains the maximum concentration of domain walls at the coercive field (corresponding to lower cycling fields) and the wall pinning can take place more easily. The cycling field dependence of fatigue also conforms in our previous report [8]. As shown in Fig. 3, all devices show similar fatigue behavior as their pristine state after 10.8 Mrad radiation. The little 2Pr difference is caused by the sample to sample variation. These observations indicate neglegible influence of  ray radiation on the cycling endurace of the device. The characteristics of hysteresis loops under electric field bias during the radiation are shown in Fig. 4. Since devices were easy to break down at high electric fields after the bonding process, we chose a relatively lower electric field of 1.6 MV/cm to measure the hysteresis loop. The hysteresis loops show little distortion or shift after radiation, which indicates that defects induced by the radiation do not make distinct domain wall pinning in the films. This is in stark contrast to PZT [14] based FeRAM devices. To exclude the effect of applied bias electric field on the hysteresis loops, we also did a control test by only applying electric field but without radiation for the same time. The result is shown in Fig. 4(b). Similar to the result in Fig. 4(a), the hysteresis loops show no obvious changes. The characteristic parameters of our device before and after radiation are summarized in Table I. We also list the radiation-hardened properties of other ferroelectric materials.

Muller_FE_HfO2_IEDM_2013.docx,Introduction,"Beingamong the first emerging NVM concepts to transition from development to production, FRAM has successfully claimed its niche on the embedded and standalone memory market. Compared to current-driven NVM concepts (e.g. MRAM, RRAM, PCRAM) the low power consumption of the field-driven memory operation in FRAM remains unchallenged. Nevertheless, state of the art FRAM based on complex perovskite systems still suffers from insufficient scalability and limited BEOL and FEOL compatibility; e.g. due to H2 diffusion barriers, lead-based materials, oxide electrodes, and thermal budget requirements (1-2). Utilizing the ferroelectric phase in HfO2 (FE-HfO2) on the other hand, a high-k dielectric well established in memory and logic devices, offers a much simpler approach. Compared to conventional FRAM, the implementation of FE-HfO2 reveals a new perspective for manufacturability and scalability of future 1T and 1T/1C ferroelectric memories. Ferroelectric Hafnium Oxide The crystalline phases and the underlying polymorphism of HfO2 and ZrO2 are well studied and have proven crucial to utilization of those transition metal oxides. Especially the ability to control the monoclinic-tetragonal-cubic phase transition by the admixture of suitable dopants or the confinement of small crystallites has enabled highly specialized ceramics. Only later, in the strive to find a suitable high-k gate and capacitor dielectric, the stabilization of high temperature, higher-k polymorphs in HfO2- and ZrO2-based thin films was adopted by microelectronic engineering. As a consequence, the electrical properties of doped HfO2 thin films were extensively studied. In the course of this development an intermediate FE-phase at the monoclinic-tetragonal phase boundary in Si:HfO2 was discovered (3). Since then, ferroelectricity in HfO2 was confirmed for several dopants known to provoke a similar kind of transition; e.g. < 10 mol% Y (4), Al (5), Gd (6), Sr (7), and with this paper La in HfO2 (Fig 1). Due to the free and surface energy differences of the polymorphs of HfO2 and ZrO2, a monoclinic-tetragonal transition, and consequently FE-properties can be observed in thin films of HfO2-ZrO2 solid solutions as well (8). Based on macroscopic and mesoscopic electrical and electromechanical observations,as well as onstructural data and fundamental considerations, a genuine, intrinsic origin of ferroelectricity in HfO2 is assumed. As opposed to artificial FE-behavior caused by parasitic effects (e.g. charge trapping), the P-E-hysteresis of FE-HfO2 is frequency independent and is reflected in a characteristic, non-linear small signal C-E-response (Fig. 2a). Piezoelectric activity, another mandatory property of all ferroelectrics, is demonstrated on macroscopic (interferometry, Fig 2a) as well as on mesoscopic scale (piezoresponse force microscopy, PFM, Fig 2b). The tight distribution of FE-activity on the film surface of FE-HfO2, as further revealed by PFM, is essential for the realization of highly area scaled ferroelectric devices. In addition to electrical data, detailed structural investigations at the monoclinic-tetragonal phase transition reveal the existence of an intermediate orthorhombic phase best matched to the diffraction pattern of the non-centrosymmetric and thereby potentially ferroelectric space group Pbc21 (3-8, Fig 3). This observation is supported by free energy considerations on phase stability in HfO2-ZrO2 (Fig 4). Consistent with",849
Muller_FE_HfO2_IEDM_2013.docx,experiment,"al findings the appearance of the polar Pbc21 phase in HfZrO4 solid solution is energetically favored.Capacitor-based FRAM In the 1T/1C device concept the stored information is represented by the polarization state of a FE-capacitor which can be accessed via a cell transistor. Write operation and destructive read out is achieved by applying voltage pulses in the nanosecond range and sensing the displacement current. Besides this fast and highly energy efficient operation mode, excellent endurance and retention properties of capacitor based FRAM has been demonstrated (1,9, table Fig 5). However, utilizing perovskite-based ferroelectrics has fundamentally slowed scaling of 1T/1C FRAM and limits its manufacturability and CMOS-compatibility. Further scaling is predicted to rely on a significant reduction of FE-layer thickness dFE and the ability to integrate 3-dimensional capacitors (1). Both aspects are not provided by the commonly used perovskite systems, which lack sufficiently conformal deposition technologies and suffer from degradation of FE-properties at reduced thickness. HfO2- and ZrO2-based systems on the other hand have proven their applicability to high aspect ratio structures in DRAM (10) and as demonstrated here for the first time maintain their planar Pr value when integrated as a 10 nm thin layer into an array of 1.6 µm deep trenches with an aspect ratio of 13:1(Fig 5). The FRAM operation principle of a planar MFM capacitor based on 10 nm thin FE-HfO2 and TiN electrodes can further be mimicked by a pulsed characterization methodology (inset Fig. 6). A switchable polarization PSW ~ 2*Pr, representing the sensing of the memory state,as well as an RC-time limited polarization reversal in the nanosecond range can be demonstrated (11, Fig 6). The underlying switching kinetics follows the typical field and time dependence of FE-polarization reversal and was found to be nucleation limited (12). Due to the high thermal stability of the FE-phase in HfO2, memory operation can be guaranteed over a broad temperature range (P-E inset Fig. 7). Even though the magnitude of polarization decreases with increasing temperature, a memory window can still be obtained at operating temperatures as high as 185°C (12, Fig. 7). Data retention measurements during 103 hours of bake time at 125°C further prove the longevity of the saturated memory state, while at the same time maintaining sufficient stability of the opposite state (13, Fig. 8). This imprint related degradation mechanism is crucial to FRAM operation (9). When lowering operation voltage to a memory state provided by unsaturated polarization loops, generally expected to be more prone to thermal depolarization, a severe 978-1-4799-2306-9/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE10.8.1IEDM13-280retention penalty has to be taken into account. The dependence of the endurance characteristics on the operating voltage is depicted in Fig 9 (13). At the lowest excitation signal which still provides saturated PE-hysteresis, FE-HfO2 shows the characteristic fatigue behavior of FE-materials. For slightly higher voltages a hard break down becomes the limiting factor. The endurance characteristics of FE-HfO2 can further be correlated to the static leakage current properties of the film, which are affected by the thermal budget during manufacturing. Lowering the crystallization anneal by 350°C improves endurance by two orders of magnitude. However, even with the best result obtained, 108-1010 switching cycles, the almost unlimited endurance of the PZT / oxide electrode stack has yet to be demonstrated (1-2,9, table Fig 5). Ferroelectric Field Effect Transistor (1T FRAM) Half a century has passed since the concept of a NVM based on a FE gate oxide was first proposed in 1963 (14). This first FRAM concept offers minimum cell size and non-destructive read out and has therefore been extensively researched. Excellent endurance has been demonstrated for the MFIS-FET, the most common FeFET configuration. Earlier limitations of data retention were overcome by the",902
Muller_FE_HfO2_IEDM_2013.docx,introduction,"of high-k buffer layers and the utilization of FE-materials of rather low permittivity (15, table Fig 10). At the same time, however, fundamental scaling limitations of the FeFET surfaced, diminishing its full potential and slowing development compared to its NVM competitors. In order to maintain manufacturability of the gate stack while shrinking gate length, a significant thickness reduction of the FE material is required (16, Fig 11). Besides difficulties in scaling the FE layer thickness dFE, an additional memory window (MW) reduction has to be considered (MW~2*Ec*dFE). However, with its high coercive field Ec of 1 MV/cm and stable FE-properties below 10 nm, FE-HfO2 can overcome this scaling dilemma; aligning FeFET and HKMG scaling at the 28 nm node (16, Fig 12). Counterclockwise IdVg-hysteresis as opposed to the clockwise hysteresis of charge trapping devices indicates the presence of FE-switching in FE-HfO2 based MFIS-FETs (Fig 10). In order to allow for the resulting FE-MW to dominate over the parasitic Vt-shift induced by charge injection, the FE-phase stability has to be precisely tuned by composition control (Fig 13). Furthermore, the fast FE-switching in the nanosecond range can be utilized to minimize the influence of this competing Vt-shift. Considering the time and field dependence of charge injection as well as the FE switching kinetics already observed in MFM capacitors, a narrow window for optimal memory operation can be derived (16, Fig 14). A nondestructive read out window was found for a Vdd/3 scheme assuming AND architecturedue to the high Ec of FE-HfO2 (Fig. 15). Vdd/2 operation, however, requires further improvement. In terms of data retention, the rather low k-value of FE-HfO2 and the thin interfacial layer utilized in this HKMG approach are highly beneficial, resulting in a low depolarization field across the FE-HfO2. This enables a residual, extrapolated MW after 10 years for testing conditions as high as 210°C (17, Fig 16). Possibly due to charge injection caused by high fields across the gate stack, the endurance of the device is currently limited to 104-105 cycles (Fig 17). Hence, the high Ec of FE-HfO2 is not only key to the renewed scaling potential of the FeFET and robustness to disturb, but also its biggest reliability concern. Lowering the thermal budget (� gate last) as well as balancing the internal field distribution in the stack by increasing the interface capacitance could improve endurance characteristics. A pulsed characterization of fast transient charging effects in FE-HfO2 based FeFETs further shows that the FE-MW is not instantly present due to superimposed electron trapping and only revealed after detrapping (Fig 18). Pulse time extrapolation of the clockwise Vt-shift caused by charge injection suggests that FE-Switching without any kind of charge injection might only be possible in the sub-nanosecond regime. Further material and interface engineering is required to reduce this parasitic effect also for longer pulse width.",694

Changes in dopant concentration alter the lattice parameters and induce distortion, and the number of ferroelectric domains changes. This appeares as the metal composition dependence of Pr. When the film becomes thick, the stability of paraelectric crystals increases and, as a result, the number of ferroelectric domains decreases. In this model, because the size of the ferroelectric domain is identical irrespective of the film parameters, EC is constant. In the case of HfO2 ferroelectrics, d in Eq. (1) may correspond to the domain size. Even in the maximum Pr film obtained with 50% Zr, the ferroelectric domains appear to be isolated and EC does not change. At present, it is difficult to examine how the ferroelectric domains are distributed in polycrystal-line films. We consider two extreme cases.

Nanostructured materials can exhibit vastly enhanced properties for these applications compared to their bulk counterparts. Especially, thin film pyroelectrics can be used for efficient conversion of thermal into electrical energy and vice versa [1]. These materials with a temperature dependent spontaneous polarization PS can already be found in widespread applications particularly in infrared sensing [2,3]. However, a lot of recent research focuses on pyroelectric energy harvesting (PEH) [4] and the inverse effect of electrocaloric cooling [5,6]. Both phenom-ena are closely related and have already been studied for half a century [4,7]. While PEH is a promising method to convert the abundance of low-grade waste heat into electric energy [8], the electrocaloric effect (ECE) might be used in solid state cooling devices with high energy efficiency [9].Achievable figures of merit (FOMs) for both applications as well as infrared sensing strongly depend on the intrinsic properties of the applied pyroelectric materials [2,4,5,10]. Especially ferroelectrics were shown to exhibit very strong pyroelectricity [2] near phase transitions to paraelectric [11,12] or antiferroelectric (AFE) phases [13]. Many of the materials investigated so far were bulk crystals or ceramics based on classical perovskite ferroelectrics [11,14–17]. Thin films were shown to exhibit remarkable properties as seen in the giant ECE for example in lead zirconate titanate (PZT) [7] and Pb0.8Ba0.2ZrO3 [12] or PEH using poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) [18]. This is mainly owed to the higher breakdown field strength compared to ceramics or bulk crystals [7]. AFE materials were also shown to have very favorable properties for electrostatic energy storage in supercapacitor applications [19,20]. Unfortu-nately, many of these complex thin films either contain lead which is toxic or deteriorate already at fairly low temperatures like polymers. Additionally, incompatibility with standard semiconductor process technology makes on-chip fabrication very complicated and therefore expensive.Recently, ferroelectricity was first shown to occur in doped HfO2 [21,22] and HfxZr1�xO2 [23] thin films. While the ferroelectric phase has been identified as the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic Pca21 phase [24], observed electric field-induced ferroelectric behavior seems to origi-nate from the tetragonal P42/nmc phase through a transi-tion to the aforementioned Pca21 phase [25]. These lead-free simple binary oxide films are temperature stable [26], highly compatible with silicon technology [27] and can be deposited on 3D nanostructures using atomic layer deposi-tion (ALD) [28]. So far, most research on these materialories and low power computing applications. Beyond that, first studies showed the great potential of HfxZr1�xO2 films exhibiting field-induced ferroelectricity for energy storage supercapacitors [31] and electrocaloric cooling as well as PEH [32]. However, an in depth study of pyroelectricity and energy storage in doped HfO2 is still missing. Therefore, in this work we investigate the pyroelectric properties of Si: HfO2 thin films and assess their applicability for infrared detectors, PEH, electrocaloric cooling devices and electro-static supercapacitors.Material and methodsSi:HfO2 films with a physical thickness of 9 nm were deposited by a metal organic ALD process based on Tetrakis-(ethylmethyla-mino)-hafnium (TEMAHf), Tetrakis-dimethylamino-silane (4DMAS) precursors and ozone. The Si content was defined by varying the cycle ratio of the precursors and monitored by secondary ion mass spectrometry and elastic recoil detection analysis on samples without thermal treatment. TiN bottom and top electrodes were deposited by a pulsed CVD process based on TiCl4 and NH3. Crystallization of the Si:HfO2 thin films (3.8 to 5.6 mol% Si) was induced by a 1000 1C/20 s anneal in nitrogen after TiN top electrode deposition. While all electrical measure-ments were performed on metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors with an electrode area of 31,000 mm2, blanket wafers were used for physical characterization. To investigate the influence of the sample temperature with respect to polarization changes the samples were heated and cooled in a range between 80 K and 480 K. The polarization versus electric field dependencies were derived from integrating the displacement current for an applied triangular AC voltage signal using a virtual ground amplifier (AixACCT TF Analyzer 2000) at a frequency of 1 kHz. Capaci-tance–voltage measurements were carried out on a HP 4284 A Precision LCR Meter for extraction of the permittivity and loss factors of the films using frequencies from 20 Hz to 10 kHz and a small-signal amplitude of 50 mV. Pyroelectric currents were measured with a Keithley 6430 Sub-Femtoamp Remote Source-Meter at 0 V while increasing the sample temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired on a Zeiss LEO 1560 microscope with an acceleration voltage of 0.8 kV. X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements were carried out on a Bruker D8 Discover (Cu-Kα radiation, λ=0.154 nm) to determine the thick-ness of the samples.TheoryThe following",1309

In addition, the effect of phase transitions on the pyroelectric properties should be discussed. Grindlay [33] describes the proper pyroelectric coefficient Π as a temperature T induced change of theelectric displacement field D=ε0E+P under the conditions of constant electric field E and stress s, which yields in our caseΠ ¼�∂T∂D�E;s¼�∂T∂P�sþ�∂s�T∂P�∂T�∂ss¼ Π1 þΠ2;ð1Þwhere P is the electrical polarization of the ferroelectric material and ε0 the vacuum permittivity. Π1 and Π2 are distinguishable quanta of the proper pyroelectric effect, whereby Π1 refers to a clamped and Π2 to an unclamped sample, respectively [3,34].To estimate Π we use the linear thermal coefficient of monoclinic ZrO2 (1.3 � 10�5K�1[35]) which is chemically very similar to HfO2. We have calculated the relaxed atom positions and Born effective charges from first principles, using the thermal expansion for the displacements, and obtained Π�23 mC/(m2K), which is rather small compared to our",463
hoffmann_TC_SiHfO2_NanoEnergy_2015.docx,results,"(see Section 4.2). Therefore, the giant pyroelectricity we observed cannot only originate from the proper pyroelectric behavior but rather from a phase transition, which is consistent with the literature for other materials near the Curie temperature [7,12,13]. If the change of dielectric displacement is caused by a phase transition, we obtain a morphotropic contribution ΠM related to the change of concentration cf(T) of the ferro-electric phase depending on T. This gives cause to extendEq.

For polycrystalline ferroelectric materials like Si:HfO2 thin films investigated here, phase transitions do not always result ina macroscopic change of P, since a poling procedure might be necessary [36]. Considering an unpoled sample with randomly oriented grains, polarization of individual domainsTransitions of a poled ferroelectric to another crystallo-graphic phase on the other hand can result in a very high ΠG, because of the much greater change of P with T. This has to be considered when comparing ΠG determined by different measurement methods, for example with and without an applied electric field. Additionally, ΠG can depend strongly on the grain size distribution in such films due to different phase transition temperatures for different grain sizes, where smaller grains have a lower Curie temperature [37,38]. Different grain size distributions can therefore result in a broadened phase transition over a wider temperature range [39].",413

In accordance with Figure 3, the temperature at which maximum ΠG occurs depends strongly on the Si concentration and is lower for higher mol% of Si.. These maximum values are considerably high [4,6] and stem mostly from the orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition (ΠG EΠM) rather than from the primary and secondary pyroelectric coefficients Π1 and Π2 [3], which coincides with our rather small estimate of 23 mC/(m2K) from section 3 and from Figure 3 where the slope of the curves for temperatures below the smallest phase transition temperatures is almost zero.. For this reason, the normalized Pr(T) is the same as cf(T) in our case and the maximum value of ΠG is only determined by the maximum of Pr, as can be seen in Eq.. (2).. To further elucidate the magnitude of the phase transi-tion contribution to ΠG, pyroelectric current measurements were carried out for 5.6 mol% Si:HfO2 without an applied electric field.. The sample was first cooled down to 173 K and then heated up again to 333 K in two steps..",457

The Vth of the 3D Fe-NAND moves in the opposite direction compared to the conventional 3D CTN NAND. The Vth of the 3D Fe-NAND decreases or increases when applying postive or negative bias on the HfO2 ferroelectric layer respectively, because of the ferroelectric characteristics as explained in Fig. 2. The P/E window is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum Vths by applying the program bias voltage in the range of 6 to 13 V after applying the erase bias voltage of 10 V. The data retention and 3k cycling endurance are also tested. The data retention property of the 3D Fe-NAND in this research is defined as the 0.6 V degradation of the Vth in 365 days. The data retention is measured by the time dependent Vth degradation of the 3D Fe-NAND. The Vth degradation time required for 0.6 V of the Vth displacement is extrapolated after the Vth shift measurement for 6 minutes. The Vth degradation slope less than 0.121 V/Dec in Vth-time(log scale) corresponds to the Vth displacement less than 0.6 V , or to the data retention time over 365 days.

Because of its silicon compatibility and wide processing space, the material shows promise for use in future memories,[2,3] energy efficient logic transistors,[4,5] and devices that exploit a tunable dielectric[6] or pyroelectric.[7–9] As understanding of ferroelectricity in HfO2 develops, grain substructure is proving increasingly important for controlling film properties. While bulk HfO2 is known to adopt the P21/c monoclinic phase (M) at room temperature and pressure,[10]“metastable” high symmetry fluorite-like phases including P42/nmc tetragonal (T) and orthorhombic (O) phases can coexist in the ferroelectric thin films.[1,2,9,11–13] An orthorhombic E.

Furthermore, they speculate that a region of coherently strained HfO2 lacking the monoclinic distortion might readily convert between the monoclinic and polar orthorhombic phase via a low transformation barrier.[22]",194

Domains of the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase are expected to exist based on the polariza-tion versus electric field response and on electrical measure-ments where single domain switching is observed.[28] Direct evidence of such domains, however, remains limited.[25,28,29] Beyond ferroelectric domains, other internal boundaries are also crucial to consider as they can impact a ferroelectric material’s mechanical and electrical response. This has been seen, for example, near morphotropic phase boundaries in the phase diagrams of certain materials. Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 exhibits Adv. Mater.

Furthermore, mobile interphase boundaries are speculated to move during cycling in both reversible and irreversible jumps, similar to domain walls, thereby converting between phases as the boundary wall moves.[32–34]Despite indications that phase transforma-tions and other defect related phenomena take place during progressive switching of ferroelectric HfO2,[15,16,25–27] the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The presence of interphase boundaries, for example, would be expected to influence phase stability by intro-ducing internal strains,[18,19,22] and electrical properties if the boundaries move during the application of an electric field.[32,34] Identifi-cation of the phase and ferroelectric domain structures would thus lead to approaches to further improve this lead-free ferroelectric.In this article, interphase boundaries and single phase domains in Gd doped HfO2 metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitors are studied using aberration corrected STEM. Monoclinic, orthorhombic, and tetragonal regions are found to coexist within single grains. Within orthorhombic domains, 90°domain walls are found only in the pris-tine samples, suggesting that their presence is altered by field-cycling.

At the O1/O2 boundary in Figure 1c, (010)o in O1 is parallel to (001)o in O2, where {111}o is continuous across the domain wall. The boundary between the two regions is sharp and possesses an abrupt change in projected symmetry at the domain wall. This symmetry change is made more visible by inspection of the atom column near neighbor distances, which are mapped in Figure 1d. An inter-phase boundary is also observed within the same grain (see Figure 1e), where the crystal structure abruptly transitions from O2 to M1 with (001)o‖(100)m.Connecting structure to polarization is essential for under-standing the ferroelectric behavior of HfO2 thin films. Polarization across the O1/O2 domain wall can be assessed by position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED), where missing mirror symmetry in the pattern cor-responds to a lack of inversion symmetry in the material.[11,35] This occurs for the Pca21 orthorhombic phase along the [001]o, and is indicated by arrows in Figure 1b,e (note that the [001]o in Figure 1b is inclined with respect to the image plane, pos-sessing a partial out-of-plane component).

The images reveal several O/O domains and O/M interphase boundary structures in a variety of shapes and sizes. Changes in atom column spacing and symmetry across the boundaries are highlighted by near neighbor distance maps in the bottom panels of Figure 2a-d. While some boundaries are angular and difficult to precisely locate, others are flat with fractional unit-cell steps. Figure 2a shows a typical 90° domain between orthorhombic regions O3 and O4. As in the case of the O1/O2 boundary in Figure 1c, (010)o becomes (001)o across the O3/O4 domain wall. The transition in crystal symmetry is abrupt, and like the O1/O2 boundary, occurs over a higher order crystal plane. Not all boundary transitions are sharp in the vicinity of 90° domain walls. For example, Figure 2b shows a 90° domain wall formed at the interface between regions O5 and O6. Unlike the O/O domains in Figures 1c and 2a, (001)o of this domain remain parallel across the boundary and instead rotate 90° in-plane.Based on the domain walls presented in Figures 2a,b, which are viewed down low order zone axes, some aspects of the structure of orthorhombic domain boundaries can be linked Figure 2. a–d) HAADF STEM images of various regions containing O/O domains and/or O/M interphase boundaries.

In con-trast, the O5/O6 boundary exhibits high misfit of ≈3.5%, and possesses a much more diffuse transition in structure across the boundary. This likely arises due to the larger misfit and/ or grain overlap. The three examples of orthorhombic domains in Figures 1c and 2a,b exemplify how local environments allow domains to form in a variety of orientations, sizes/shapes, and domain wall configurations.The monoclinic phase is found to form twin boundaries in some grains. For example, a (110)m twin in Figure 2d is identi-fied between the monoclinic regions M5 and M6. Twining also occurs on (001)m (Figure S1a, Supporting Information) and (100)m (Figure S1b, Supporting Information). These twin planes are in good agreement with various reports of twinning con-figurations identified in toughened zirconia ceramics,[36] HfO2 thin films grown directly on Si,[37] and in Hf-rich HfxZr1 −xO2 nanocrystals.[38] Twinning is associated with the tetragonal to monoclinic martensitic phase transformation.[36–39] Such a phase transformation requires a shape change to the distorted monoclinic cell, and twinning is a mechanism whereby shape change/shear strain can be minimized for the transformation of a confined grain.[36] Figure 2a-d also shows that many HfO2 regions con-tain interphase boundaries.

Visually, the M4/O7 interphase boundary resembles the M2/O3 boundary, but the orthorhombic region is rotated 90° such that (001)o forms the boundary rather than (010)o.. In addition to the M/O boundaries in Figure 2a,c the tetragonal phase is observed near the TiN electrodes.. Interfa-cial HfO2 layers near TiN electrodes are previously reported to relax towards tetragonal symmetry in some instances which may arise from local chemical/bonding changes, changes in local oxygen vacancy concentrations, or from local orienta-tion relationships between the TiN/HfO2.. [15,16] These findings suggest that the environment near interphase boundaries can help stabilize the tetragonal phase.. For instance, the T regions at the M/O boundaries in Figure 2a,c penetrates around ≈2–4 nm into the bulk grain, which is deeper than previously reported at grain/electrode boundaries.. [16] Transition regions with mixed/strained symmetry like the tetragonal interface layers reported earlier can be important for phase stabiliza-tion.. [40] Due to the complex nature of this polycrystalline inter-face, however, further studies are needed to form a complete picture of bonding and orientation relationships for the HfO2/ TiN interface.. The interphase boundaries in Figure 2b,d have reduced step density compared to those in Figure 2a,c.. For example at the O6/M3 interface in Figure 2b, an abrupt interphase boundary is formed with (001)o‖(100)m. The transition in crystal symmetry from orthorhombic to monoclinic is sharp in this case, having less distortion.. Further, the boundary between the O8/M5 regions shows no clear steps between the (010)o‖(100)m planes that form the wall in Figure 2d.. A second boundary in this region also forms between O8/M6 regions with (001)o‖(100)m, with varied step density..",546

The layers with minor distor-tions are structurally very similar between the monoclinic and orthorhombic phases. By contrast, the majority of the differ-ences between the monoclinic and orthorhombic phase occur within the major distortion layers.The nominal structures of the major distortion layers are labeled in Figure 5b. Several interesting structural features occur in this boundary. First, the bottom red arrow in R2 indi-cates a monoclinic-like major distortion layer that becomes an orthorhombic-like major distortion layer across the R2/R1 boundary. Next, the monoclinic major distortion layer at the same red arrow appears “twinned” with respect to the monoclinic major distortion layer indicated by the top red arrow. This twin-like feature occurs across a major distor-tion layer resembling the orthorhombic phase (black arrow). Adv. Mater. Interfaces 2018, 17012581701258 (5 of 9)© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Such boundaries would also play Figure 5b). a role in fatigue mechanisms in these materials. While beyond The large variation in the structure at these boundaries hints at the potential for mobility during the application of an electric field. Specifically, the “snapshot” in Figure 5b sug-gests an interphase boundary in various states of converting between the monoclinic and orthorhombic lattices, much as suggested by the “step-flow”-like motion of the same boundary orientation in ref. [43]. Crystal chemistry suggests a double [001]o(010)o glide system converts the orthorhombic phase into the monoclinic phase, with the reverse occurring by a [001]m (100)m double glide.[45] Such glides impact the symmetry of the entire unit cell, though a majority of the structural changes occur within the major distortion portions of the unit cells.[45] Consistent with this, the structure of the major distortion layer indicated by the bottom red arrow transitions between glide states at the boundary between regions R2 and R1. Further-more, this glide system explains how insertion of one phase’s major distortion structure into the other phase initiates fea-tures akin to “anti-phase-like” and “twin-like” defects, as dis-cussed above.Consistent with the understanding that some interphase boundaries are likely immobile in ferroelectric HfO2, M/O interphase boundaries are still observed after field-cycling, of which Figure 5b,c is an example.

yi_FE_ZrO2_2019.docx,Introduction,"ultralow-power nanoelectronics.Conventional FE/AFE materials are perovskite oxides, such as leadFerroelectric (FE) materials have spontaneous polarization and can undergo polarization switching by application of an external electric field. Through reading their polarization states, FEs can be utilized in memory applications, including ferroelectric random access memory, ferroelectric field-effect transistors, and ferroelectric tunnel junction [1–3]. On the other hand, antiferroelectric (AFE) materials have no macroscopic polarization and can experience reversible field-induced phase transition from either an anti-polar or non-polar phase to a FE phase under an applied electric field [4,5]. Because of the considerable variation of polarization and volume during the phase transition, AFEs have great potential in energy storage and conversion, pyroelectric energy harvesting, electrocaloric cooling, and infrared sensing for thermal imaging [6–10]. Although AFEs are generally considered un-suitable for memory applications due to the lack of remanent polar-ization (Pr), nonvolatile memory devices based on AFEs have been demonstrated based on a built-in field created by asymmetric electrodes with different workfunctions or stabilization of the FE phase by stacking layers [11,12]. In addition, FE and AFE materials could provide nega-tive capacitance during polarization switching [13,14]. With the in-tegration of FEs/AFEs into the gate-stack of nanoscale transistors, the subthreshold swing can be reduced to below 60 mV per decade [15,16]. Hence, FE and AFE dielectrics show promising applications in future⁎ Corresponding authors.zirconate titanate (PZT) and lead zirconate (PZ) systems [2,17]. They are, however, not environment-friendly due to the presence of lead. In recent years, HfO2- and ZrO2-based thin films have been discovered to possess (anti)ferroelectricity [18–20]. Owing to the compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing, HfO2 and ZrO2 have become prospective candidates for novel device appli-cations.The ferroelectricity in HfO2- and ZrO2-based materials has been attributed to the polar non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic crystalline structure (space group: Pca21, o-phase) [18,19,21], which was first discovered in Mg-doped ZrO2 [22]. On the other hand, the origin of the antiferroelectricity in HfO2- and ZrO2-based materials has been re-cognized as the phase transformation between the nonpolar tetragonal crystalline structure (space group: P42/nmc, t-phase) and the o-phase when an electric field is applied [18,19,23]. The most stable crystalline structure in HfO2 and ZrO2, however, is the monoclinic phase (space group: P21/c, m-phase) under room temperature and atmospheric pressure [24,25]. To stabilize the o-phase or t-phase in HfO2 or ZrO2 thin films, impurity doping or alloying has often been adopted [18,26–28]. Nevertheless, doping or alloying engineering usually re-quires high-temperature annealing to achieve the (anti)ferroelectricity, which is unfavorable to process integration and device scalingE-mail addresses: jayshieh@ntu.edu.tw (J.

Besides, non-uniform distribution of dopants in FE/AFE thin films may be a concern.It has also been reported that electrode materials used in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structures have a great impact on the FE/AFE characteristics of HfO2- or ZrO2- based thin films. For instance, the solid solution of 50% HfO2 and 50% ZrO2 (Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, abbreviated HZO) exhibits ferroelectricity on TiN electrode but paraelectric on Pt elec-trode [29]. One the other hand, for pure ZrO2 thin films, anti-ferroelectricity has been observed in the TiN/ZrO2/TiN structure [12,19,30] while ferroelectricity has been measured in the Pt/ZrO2/Pt structure, respectively [31,32]. The",1222

The HfO2 interfacial layers enhance the FE properties, while the TiO2 interfacial layers convert the original FE ZrO2 into AFE. The remanent polarization of the FE ZrO2 is enhanced by the in-troduction of the HfO2 interfacial layers, which is attributed to the formation of the o-phase with (111) preferred orientation. The anti-ferroelectricity of the ZrO2 with the TiO2 interfacial layers is confirmed to originate from the presence of the t-phase. Utilizing the HfO2/TiO2 interface engineering to modulate the FE/AFE properties of ZrO2 thin films is a feasible and practical method for precise control and fabri-cation.

First, a Pt bottom electrode (∼100 nm thick) was deposited on a TiO2/Si substrate structure by magnetron sputtering, where the TiO2 layer serves as an adhesion layer. Next, a HfO2 or TiO2 bottom interfacial layer was deposited on the Pt bottom electrode. Then a ∼12-nm ZrO2 thin film was deposited on the bottom interfacial layer. Subsequently, a top HfO2 or TiO2 interfacial layer was deposited on the ZrO2 thin film. All the HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2 layers were prepared by remote plasma atomic layer deposition (ALD) (Fiji, Cambridge Nanotech) at 300 °C. Tetrakis(dimethylamino)hafnium (Hf[N(CH3)2]4), Tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium (Ti[N(CH3)2]4), Tetrakis(dimethyla-mino)zirconium (Zr[N(CH3)2]4, TDMAZ), and oxygen plasma were the sources for Hf, Ti, Zr, and O, respectively. The HfO2 and TiO2 interfaciallayers were deposited with 6 and 10 ALD cycles, and the growth per cycle (GPC) of the HfO2 and TiO2 was ∼1.6 and ∼0.8 Å/cycle, re-spectively. Afterwards, a Pt top electrode is deposited by magnetron sputtering. The electrode of a diameter of 200 μm was defined using optical lithography and lift-off process. Finally, the MIM structures were treated with a post-metallization annealing (PMA) process at 600 °C in N2 atmosphere for 30 s using rapid thermal annealing. Because platinum has low reactivity with oxide thin films, it was chosen as the electrode material to prevent the formation of any undesired interfacial layer.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses of the thin films were carried out by a high-resolution transmission microscope (2010 F, JEOL) operating at200 kVequippedwithanenergy-dispersiveX-rayspectrometer.Dynamic hysteresis measurements were performed with a bipolar tri-angular voltage excitation at 2 kHz using a ferroelectric analyser (TF2000, aixACCT). The capacitance-voltage (C–V) characteristics of the samples were measured by a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor characterization system. The grazing incidence (2θ), out-of-plane (2θ/ ω), and in-plane (2θχ/φ) X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using an X-ray diffractometer (TTRAX III, Rigaku) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm).

Although the thicknesses of the HfO2 and TiO2 interfacial layers cannot be clearly distinguished in the images, they could be estimated to be less than 1 nm according to the difference in the thickness between the ZO and HZH/TZT thin films, as well as the number of the applied ALD cycles and the GPC of the respective films.4039S.-H.

Each of the switching currents is associated with the phase transition between the non-polar and the polar phase, leading to a sudden change in the displacement current [19,23,33].. The result indicates that the dielectric properties of the ZrO2 thin film can be converted from ferroelectricity to antiferroelectricity by sub-nanometre TiO2 interfacial layers.. The dramatic transformation of the dielectric properties of the ZrO2 may be attributed to the tailoring of the crystalline phases in the ZrO2 layer by the HfO2 and TiO2 interfacial layers.. Hence grazing incidence, out-of-plane, and in-plane XRD measurements were carried out to analyze the crystalline phases of the ZO, HZH, and TZT samples, as shown in Figs.. 5 and 6.. The GIXRD was scanned with the 2θ ranging from 26° to 38°, where the diffraction peaks appear in random-oriented polycrystalline ZrO2..

On the other hand, the increase of the di-electric constant in the TZT thin film can be understood from the for-mation of the highly-oriented t-phase with a higher dielectric constantFig. 5. a) GIXRD patterns of the ZO, HZH, and TZT samples after 600 °C N2 annealing for 30 s.

All of the peaks in a) correspond to the planes perpendicular to the t(110) plane. The peak at 72.9° in b) is ascribed to the (004) reflection of thet-phase.

The decrease/increase of the dielectric constants of HZH/TZT is ascribed to the presence of the m/t-phases, respectively, as revealed from the XRD patterns.as large as 46 [19,34]. The decrease/increase of the dielectric constants agrees well with the presence of the m/t crystalline phases as revealed by the XRD patterns in Figs. 5 and 6.The impact of the thickness of the HfO2 and TiO2 interfacial layers on the FE/AFE properties of ZrO2 is shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Fig. 8 shows that the ferroelectricity of the HZH samples is severely degraded as the thickness of the HfO2 interfacial layers increase from 0.6 nm to 2.3 nm. This is attributed to the presence of more m-phase in the HZH with the increased thickness of the HfO2 interfacial layers, as shown in the XRD patterns provided in Fig. S1a in Supplementary materials. It has been reported that HfO2 thin films tend to crystalize into the m-phase as the thickness increases [33,35], as supported by the presence of the m-phase in the XRD pattern of a 3-nm HfO2 thin film in Fig. S2a in Sup-plementary materials. Thus, the increase in the thickness of the HfO2 interfacial layers might provide more nucleation sites for the crystal-lization of the m-phase in the ZrO2 layer, which deteriorates the FE characteristics. In addition, a series connection of the FE ZrO2 layer with the paraelectric HfO2 layers also",882
yi_FE_ZrO2_2019.docx,results,"in a degradation of the FE properties of the HZH sample [36,37]. On the other hand, Fig. 9 reveals that the thickness of the TiO2 interfacial layers (from 1 nm to 2.5 nm) has little impact on the AFE characteristics of the TZT samples. The result is supported by the XRD patterns provided in Fig. S1b in Sup-plementary materials, which demonstrates that the textured t-phase in the TZT samples has little change with the increase of the TiO2 thick-ness. In addition, it has been reported that the energy barrier between the conduction band of TiO2 and the Fermi level of Pt is small of only∼0.3 eV [38]. Hence, the electrons in Pt can transport into the TiO2 layers due to the small energy barrier. Besides, the oxygen vacancies and defect states can facilitate the carrier transport in TiO2 [39]. Therefore, the TiO2 layer may behave much like a resistor instead of a capacitor. Accordingly, the TiO2 layers would not take much voltage drop as connected in series with the ZrO2 layer. As a result, the anti-ferroelectricity in the TZT samples is not as sensitive as the ferroelec-tricity in the HZH samples to the variation of the thickness of interfacial layers.Impurity doping or alloying has been the prevalent method for tailoring the FE/AFE characteristics in dielectrics [18,26–28]. Because all the samples had been treated with a PMA process at 600 °C, there is a concern that the modulation of the ZrO2 FE/AFE properties may arise from the doping of Hf or Ti into ZrO2 instead of the effect of interfacial layers. To distinguish the effect of interfacial layers from that of the impurity doping/alloying, the FE/AFE characteristics of the as-de-posited ZO, HZH, and TZT samples (without the PMA treatment) were also measured. All the processing temperatures of the as-deposited samples did not exceed 300 °C, which is supposed to suppress the effect of impurity doping/alloying. As demonstrated in Fig. 10, the as-de-posited ZO, HZH, and TZT samples also exhibited FE/AFE behaviors similar to those shown in Fig. 4. The result reveals that the impurity doping/alloying from the interfacial layers into ZrO2 might not be the main contribution to the FE/AFE properties of the ZrO2 layer. Fur-thermore, it is demonstrated that the interface engineering by the HfO2/TiO2 interfacial layers is capable of tailoring the FE/AFE char-acteristics of ZrO2 thin films with significant enhancement or trans-formation without the need of high-temperature treatments, which is highly beneficial to the process integration for further device scaling in memory devices and negative capacitance transistors.In order to explain the effect of the interfacial layers, the stabili-zation of the t- and o-phase in ZrO2 is discussed as follows. From the thermodynamic point of view, the effects of surface energy and strain play an important role for the stabilization of metastable crystalline phases [22,33]. For ZrO2, the metastable t-phase tends to be stabilized in nanoscale thin films due to the surface energy effect [33]. The o-phase is also a metastable phase in ZrO2, and its free energy is slightly higher than that of the t-phase as indicated by the first principle cal-culation [22,33]. Studies have indicated that the stabilization of the ZrO2 o-phase in nanoscale thin films cannot be achieved only by the surface energy effect [33,35]. Although it has been reported that the strain engineering is able to stabilize the o-phase in ZrO2 [23,40], the",856

However, pronounced ferroelectric properties originating from the o-phase have been observed in nanoscale ZrO2 thin films [31,32,41]. As a result, mechanisms other than the surface energy and strain effects should be4042S.-H. Yi, et al. Journal of the European Ceram ic Society 39 (2019) 4038–4045Fig. 8.

Park et al. suggested the complicated process of in-situ crystallization in plasma-enhanced ALD may be a possible reason [35]. Shibayama et al. proposed that the non-equilibrium deposition process favors the formation of the metastable o-phase from the kinetic point of view [41]. The in-situ crystallization and non-equilibrium deposition process fit the",527
yi_FE_ZrO2_2019.docx,results,"in this study. Therefore, these points of view should be taken into account to un-derstand the presence of the ferroelectric o-phase in ZrO2.The impact of the interfacial layers on ferroelectricity/anti-ferroelectricity is proposed as follows. In ALD, the condition of sub-strate surface is critical to the growth mode of the overlying thin film during the initial deposition stage, which brings a significant impact on the formed crystalline phase [42]. Because of insufficient amount of reactive sites on the inert Pt surface for the chemisorption of ALD precursors, the growth of ZrO2 in the ZO sample supposedly tends to proceed in a non-equilibrium kinetic process in the first few ALD cycles, resulting in the island-like nucleation and in-situ crystallization to the o-phase [35,41,43]. These o-phase nuclei continue to develop in the subsequent ALD process, which leads to the formation of the o-phase inin the XRD pattern, Fig. S2a) suppresses the formation of the o-phase(Fig. S1a) and thus degrades the FE features of the overlying ZrO2 layer (Fig. 8). This outcome also supports the role of the HfO2 interfacial layer as the seeding layer for the ZrO2 growth.For the TZT sample, the XRD pattern shown in Fig. S2b indicates theamorphous structure in the 4-nm TiO2 layer after 600 °C N2 annealing for 30 s. Thus, the structure of ∼1 nm TiO2 interfacial layers is expected to be amorphous. The TiO2 interfacial layer would provide sufficient hydroxyl groups at the surface for the chemisorption of TDMAZ pre-cursors for the deposition of ZrO2, which may prefer the near-equili-brium growth of initial ZrO2 nuclei. Thus, the thermodynamically fa-vorable t-phase would dominate over the o-phase during the filmgrowth. This accounts for the formation of t-phase in the TZT sample.Moreover, the TiO2 interfacial layer remains amorphous as the thick-ness increases (Fig. S2b), which does not affect the crystalline t-phase ofthe overlying ZrO2 layer. This explains the similar XRD patterns (Fig. S1b) and AFE characteristics (Fig. 9) of the TZT samples with differentthicknesses of the TiO2 interfacial layers.the ZO sample. On the other hand, the thermodynamic study has pre-4.",618

The o-phase HfO2 then serves as nucleation sites for the growth of the overlying ZrO2, which facilitates the emergence of the o-phase (Fig. 5b) and enhances the FE properties (Fig. 4b) of the HZH sample. Furthermore, as the thickness of the HfO2 interfacial layers increases, the presence of the HfO2 m-phase (as shownIn this study, sub-nanometer TiO2 and HfO2 interfacial layers are demonstrated to have strong impact on the FE and AFE properties ofZrO2 thin films. The HfO2 interfacial layers boost the formation of the orthorhombic phase in ZrO2 film with (111) texture, leading to sig-nificant enhancement of the ferroelectricity. The TiO2 interfacial layers contribute to the formation of the (110)-textured tetragonal ZrO2, giving rise to the pronounced antiferroelectricity ascribed to the field-induced phase transition from the t- to the o-phase.

We have investigated the endurance−retention dilemma in La-doped epitaxial films. Compared to undoped epitaxial films, large values of polarization are obtained in a wider thickness range, whereas the coercive fieldsare similar, and the leakage current is substantially reduced.Compared to polycrystalline La-doped films, epitaxial La-doped films show more fatigue, but there is no significant wake-up effect and endurance−retention dilemma. The persistent wake-up effect,common to polycrystalline La-doped Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films, is limited to a few cycles in epitaxial films.

Sanchez_La_HZO_ACSAMI_2020.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Stabilization of the metastable orthorhombic (o) ferroelectric phase in doped HfO2 films1can have a great technological impact.. HfO2 films can be grown by atomic layer deposition, a process compatible with CMOS technology, and can overcome the lack of scalability of conventional ferroelectric oxides.2−4 Ferroelectric hafnia holds promise not only for nonvolatile random access devices but also for emerging ferroelectric memories such as tunnel junctions and field effect transistors.. However, the endurance of HfO2 capacitors, which is a critical property for memory devices, is moderately low.. The low endurance of ferroelectric HfO2 is perhaps the consequence of a large coercive field (Ec), >1 MV/cm, around 1 order of magnitude greater than that of perovskite oxides.. The electric field required to cycle HfO2 is very high, close to the breakdown field, and endurance of HfO2 capacitors is generally limited by hard breakdown that usually occurs well below 1010 cycles.. Doping with trivalent La atoms has allowed a significant improvement.. In particular, Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) films doped with 1 mol % La show increased polarization and an endurance of up to 4 × 1010cycles.5This was accomplished by reducing Ec and leakage current by around 30% and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively.5Optimizing the amount of La has allowed a further enhancement.6HZO capacitors doped with 0.7 mol % La remained operational after 1011cycles and without polarization reduction (fatigue).6However, optimiza- severe degradation of polarization retention.7The endurance of films doped with 2.5 mol % La, the optimal amount by considering all ferroelectric properties, was only 107cycles..",391

Besides the (001) and (002) reflections of the STO substrate and the LSMO electrode, there is a peak at 2θ around 30°, coincident with the position of the o-HZO(111) reflection in epitaxial undoped HZO films.15A zoomed 2θ range around this peak, scanned with a longer acquisition time, is in the right panel of Figure 1a.. By increasing thickness, the o-HZO(111) peak becomes narrower and Laue oscillations are evident.. The thickness of the thickest film, calculated by simulation of the Laue oscillations (Supporting Information S1), is 13.1 nm.. The simulation shows an asymmetry, with the satellites being more intense at lower angles than at higher angles with respect to the o-HZO(111) peak.. Asymmetry is observed in similar undoped epitaxial HZO(111) films.13,15Laue oscillations around LSMO reflections are not observed because of the LSMO thickness (25 nm) and the measurement with Cu Kα radiation that included Cu Kα1 and Cu Kα2 components..

It is discovered that: 1) the degree of charge trapping depends on the substrate that nFeFETs exhibit significant electron trapping but negligible hole trapping during memory write while pFeFETs exhibit much less electron trapping but significant hole trapping when heavily stressed; 2) due to enhanced electric field in the interlayer and semiconductor, the like initial polarization states (i.e., initialized by a pulse of the same polarity as the write pulse) could exacerbate charge trapping induced by the write pulse; 3) electron trapping is fully recoverable while hole trapping shows a semi-permanent component which involves interface trap generation; and 4) less significant charge trapping in pFeFETs allows immediate read-after-write at normal operating conditions.Index Terms— Charge trapping, ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET), memory window.I.",222

Significant progresses in improving silicon FeFET performance and reliability have been accomplished ever since its discovery. For example, FeFET with memory window around 1.5-V and 10-ns write latency can be achieved with 4-V write pulses [4]. Process optimization has been underway such that the smallest FeFET size is pushed to 200 nm x 200 nm, above which the device-to-device variation is tightly controlled such that the bit error rate is low [5]. Endurance cycling is improving with the introduc-tion of new structures [6] and new interlayer dielectrics [7] such that 1010cycles are within reach. These advancements are exciting developments in making FeFET a competitive candidate for embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM).Charge trapping remains a major challenge in FeFETs due to the induced threshold voltage (VTH) instability [8]–[11], as shown in Fig. 1. HfO2 is known to have a high density of intrinsic defects, and the interface of HfO2/interlayer and interlayer/semiconductor is typically defective, which can trap electrons and holes [12]–[15], counteracting the VTH shift induced by polarization switching. For example, polarization switching after a positive gate pulse shifts VTH negatively, while the induced electron trapping in the gate-stack",760

For example, to sense the polarization states in FeFETs, typically a long wait after write pulses is inserted before the memory read such that the trapped charges can fully relax and the polarization switching effect will be revealed. However, the charge release process after charge trapping affects the read-after-write operation and limits the operation speed, as shown in Fig. 1.Up to date, the electron trapping and de-trapping dynamics have been extensively studied in n-channel FeFET (nFeFET) in the past through various",168

However, a simi-lar understanding on hole trapping is not available. A few stud-ies have shown negligible hole trapping in nFeFETs [12], [13], but have not been cross validated using different characteriza-tion techniques and firmly established. Understanding of the asymmetry in electron and hole trapping is incomplete and preliminary so far.Additionally, it is also unclear how much the memory window is reduced by charge trapping under different write conditions and whether charge trapping is fully recoverable. The required delay time for the trapped charge to fully release is also not clear, which directly affects the read throughput as a long delay time excludes immediate read-after-write. It is also known that charge trapping will be affected by the initial polarization state, which impacts the electric field distribution within the gate-stack, but this has not been verified",534

Both the types of FeFETs feature a 10-nm-thick Zr-doped HfO2 (Hf0.5Zr0.5O2) as the ferroelectric thin film, 1.6-nm SiO2 native oxide as the interlayer, and 15-nm TiN as the gate electrode, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The stack is then treated with rapid thermal annealing at 500◦C for 30 s to induce ferroelectricity in HZO.To unravel the charge trapping and de-trapping dynamics, the one-spot measurements, as shown in Fig. 3(a), are per-formed on both nFeFETs and pFeFETs [9]. In this work, irrespective of nFeFET or pFeFET, the state with VTH on the right is named as the high-VTH state (HVT) and that on the left as the low-VTH state (LVT). First, the devices are initialized into a pre-determined state with ±4-V, 1-μs write pulses, and then a write pulse of a given pulse amplitude and pulsewidth is applied. Immediately after the write pulse, a series of probing pulses are applied at different relaxation times to probe the charge relaxation dynamics [18], [19]. ID measured at each probe pulse could be translated into the VTH shift to a reference ID − VG curve by assuming a parallel curve shift due to charge trapping, as shown in Fig. 3(b)–(d). Note that this assumption may yield inaccurate estimation of the VTH shift if the subthreshold slope changes due to interface trap generation, which, in that case, serves as an approximation. Repeating these measurements under different write conditions allows to map the full charge trapping and de-trapping dynamics.For the study, the Keithley 4200 pulse measurement units are used for characterization.

Before the one-spot measurement, both nFeFETs and pFeFETs are fully woken up and exhibit a full memory window.To provide a plausible explanation of the difference in the charge trapping behavior between nFeFETs and pFeFETs, a theoretical investigation will be performed in TCAD. The model, as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), is built with a1-μm-thick silicon substrate, a 1.6-nm SiO2 interlayer, and a 10-nm-thick HZO ferroelectric. For simulations, 1016cm−3 n-type and p-type Si substrates are assumed. The ferroelectric is described with the dynamic Preisach model, where the ferroelectric thin film is considered to be composed of multiple independent switching regions, and the model parameters are obtained from calibration with a 10-nm-thick HZO metal–ferroelectric–metal (MFM) capacitors [22].

For this measurement, the write-to-measure delay, as illustrated in the gate waveform shown in Fig. 2(b), is adjusted to modulate the amount of remaining trapped charges that will be sensed in measurement. For example, increasing the delay will leave more time for the trapped carriers to release. As a result, less trapped carriers will be sensed and the polarization switching effects will dominate. Note that this measurement only yields qualitative understanding about the impact of delay on FeFET characteristics, because the ID−VG measurement process itself lasts for 5 ms, which may disturb charge trapping and de-trapping given a relatively wide range of gate biases swept during measurement. The relative shift of ID − VG curves at different delay times qualitatively shows the impact of delay on the device characteristics.As shown in Fig. 4(a), reducing the write-to-measure delay time from 0.1 s to 1 μs increases VTH of the low-VTH state while has a negligible impact on the high-VTH state.Fig. 5.

It indicates the possibility of immediate read-after-write in pFeFETs, better than its n-channel counterparts. However, in this work, to minimize the read-induced disturb, the fast one-spot measurement, rather than the slow ID−VG measurement, is adopted for quantitative evaluation.The switching dynamics in nFeFETs and pFeFETs under different write pulse widths at various pulse amplitudes from 2 to 4 V are shown in Fig. 4(b) and (d), respectively. Both the types of FeFETs exhibit a high-speed operation (∼50 ns) and a large memory window (∼1 V) under 4-V write ampli-tude. It is interesting to see that pFeFETs exhibit a slightly better memory window and switching speed compared with nFeFETs. However, it is insufficient to conclude that pFeFETs fundamentally outperform nFeFETs as different trends where nFeFETs exhibit a better memory window than pFeFETs have been reported [13], [20], [21]. Therefore, in this work, this difference is probably related to device fabrications and needs more comprehensive investigations, which is beyond the scope of this work.

Simulated (b) band diagram and (c) electrical field in nFeFET using TCAD tools at the beginning of 3-V write pulse under ±4-V initialization.A. Electron Trapping and De-Trapping Dynamics in nFeFETsThe dependence of charge trapping on the initial polariza-tion states is first investigated. Due to charge continuity across the gate-stack, as shown in the following equation: PFE + εFEEFE = εILEIL (1)where PFE is the polarization, and εFE/εIL and EFE/EIL are the dielectric constant and electric field in the ferroelec-tric/interlayer, respectively. The polarization will therefore determine the electric field in the interlayer and semiconductor, thus affecting the charge trapping dynamics.As shown in Fig. 6(a), when applying a positive write pulse to FeFET, the interlayer electric field is strengthened by polarization pointing at the channel (e.g., considered as positive polarization in this work), which thus facilitates electron injection into the gate-stack. On the contrary, polar-ization pointing toward the gate (i.e., negative polarization) weakens the interlayer electric field, thus suppressing electron trapping. Similarly, under the negative write pulse, a negative polarization helps hole injection into HfO2, while a positive polarization suppresses hole injection. Therefore, if the write pulse has a like polarity as the initial polarization, charge injection will get enhanced.Fig. 6(b) and (c) shows the band diagram and the electric field in an nFeFET at the beginning of a 3-V write pulse given two different initial states defined by ±4-V write pulses. The polarization is relaxed to be 1.3 μC/cm2/−1.6 μC/cm2after the +4-V/−4-V write pulse, respectively, for both nFeFET and pFeFET. It shows that the like initial state (i.e., +4 V initialization) has a much larger interlayer electric field than the opposite initial state (i.e., −4-V initialization), which will cause a higher charge injection in the case of like initial state. The high interlayer electric field, as also predicted in [9] and [23], due to the low interlayer dielectric constant and the polarization charge, poses significant challenges to FeFETTo verify this initial state dependence, electron trapping and de-trapping are first characterized in nFeFETs. Fig. 7(a) shows the real-time VTH after 1-μs write pulses of different pulse amplitudes from 2 to 4 V with a step of 0.2 V, given the−4-V, 1-μs initialization.

No polarization switching and charge trapping have been observed, consistent with Fig. 4(b). With the increase in the pulse amplitude, polarization starts to switch, and therefore VTH after a long relaxation time (e.g., 1 s) approaches the LVT state. However, the increased amplitudes also induce electron trapping as VTH immediately after the write pulse (e.g., 5-μs relaxation time) is higher than the final stabilized VTH. The difference grows with the pulse amplitude, indicating a significant number of electrons trapped immediately after write and get released thereafter.1-μs initialization, as shown in Fig. 7(b), where the nFeFET Similar measurements are also performed for the +4-V,starts from the LVT state. With the increase in the pulse amplitudes, VTH immediately after write increases due to increased trapped electrons in the gate-stack, but the stabilized VTH converges, irrespective of the write pulse amplitudes as the nFeFET has already been in the LVT state and no polarization reversal is induced by the write pulses. Interestingly, electron release is observed even with 2-V write pulse, different from electric field, as explained in Fig. 6. In both Fig. 7(a) and (b), the −4-V initialization case. This is due to the higher interlayer VTH under 4-V write amplitude at 0.1-s relaxation time (i.e., same as the ID − VG measurement of the LVT state) is about 0.1 V lower than the LVT state VTH. This small difference, likely due to the different measurement time (i.e., 10 μs per bias in ID − VG measurement, while 4 μs in one-spot measurement) and FeFET cycle-to-cycle variation, does not affect the overall",412

This indicates that the voltage shift induced by trapped electrons in pFeFET is less than 0.4 V, considering that the probe voltage is at −0.4 V and the pFeFET noise boundary is at −0.8 V for the LVT state, as shown in Fig. 4(c). This small amount of electron trapping has been observed for write pulse amplitudes ranging from 1 to 4 V, given that the pFeFETs start from the LVT state. This is much less compared with nFeFETs [i.e., about 1.2-V trapped electron-induced VTH shift at 4-V write pulse as shown in Fig. 7(c)] at the same initial states.

VTH is completely within the noise level when write pulses larger than 3.8 V are applied, above which the pFeFET is written into the LVT state and the small VTH shift induced by trapped electrons (i.e., <0.4 V) will cause the measured current below the noise floor.

Fig. 12(a) and (c) shows the measured hole de-trapping dynamics in pFeFETs when initialized with −4 and +4 V, respectively. At −4-V initialization, the application of −3-V write pulse causes reduction in VTH, indicating hole trapping. The increase in write pulsewidth from 100 ns to 10 ms causes∼0.6-V VTH shift. Comparing this result with electron trapping in pFeFET shown in Fig. 10(d), hole trapping during negative write pulses is much more significant. Another interesting feature of the hole detrapping dynamics is the time scale involved, where the trapped holes are not fully released even after 2-s relaxation, much longer than electron de-trapping in nFeFETs, which lasts about 10 ms. This is likely related to the generation of interface trap during memory write with negative write pulses [19].Fig. 12(b) shows the extracted absolute VTH shift at 12.2-μs relaxation time as a function of write pulse widths under different pulse amplitudes. The obtained characteris-tics are similar to the hole trapping characteristics typically observed in negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) mea-surements, which is composed of initial trapping in preexisting defects and later generation of interface traps [19], [24].At large write pulse amplitudes, for example, −4 V, the VTH shift, can be well fit with the relationship ofwith the previous analysis on the initial state dependence of hole trapping, the relaxedVTH, defined in Fig. 12(a), is larger for the −4-V initialization compared with +4-V initialization, as shown in Fig. 12(d).

Though for practical applications, the memory write does not require a long pulse [e.g., 50 ns at −4 V is good enough as shown in Fig. 4(d)], it will be interesting to evaluate whether repetitive write operation will cause accumulation of interface trap density and thus degrade pFeFET.D. Hole Trapping and De-Trapping Dynamics in nFeFETsWhen the silicon substrate changes from n-type in pFeFET to p-type in nFeFET, the amount of hole trapping induced during negative write pulses is significantly reduced, as will be shown in this section. Similar to the study in Fig. 9, the band diagram at the beginning of negative write pulse, VW = −3 V, is simulated and compared between nFeFET and pFeFET, when both are initialized with −4 V to have identical polarization, as shown in Fig. 13(a). Interestingly, for nFeFET, the voltage drop across the p-type substrate is significant while it is much smaller in pFeFET. The reason is that for pFeFET, the hole supply comes from source/drain doping, while in nFeFET, it comes from the p-type substrate.VTH(t) = Atn (2) As a result, this significant voltage drop in the silicon substratereduces the interlayer electric field in nFeFET, hence also holewhich is a linear curve on the logV–log(t) plot.

At short pulse When initialized at +4 V, interaction between polarizationwidths (e.g., 100 ns), no polarization switching is observed, nor hole de-trapping. With the increase in pulsewidth up to 30 μs, increased polarization switching is induced while no hole de-trapping exists (i.e., VTH is flat with respect to the relaxation time).

Kai_Unraveling_the_Dynamics_of_Charge_Trapping_and_De-Trapping_in_Ferroelectric_FETs_TED_2022.docx,results,", a full picture of electron and hole trapping and de-trapping during memory write operation can be made clear. Considering only a single memory write, several observations can be made. First, nFeFET generally suffers from significant electron trapping which can be fully recovered after around 10-ms delay, while almost immune to hole trapping unless a very long electrical stress is applied. In contrast, pFeFET could suffer significantly from hole trapping through interface defect generation during long negative write voltages, while benefits from reduced elec-tron trapping, though not completely immune, compared with nFeFET. This makes it possible for pFeFET to immediately read-after-write under normal write conditions (e.g., ±4 V, 100 ns), while it is challenging for nFeFET due to the necessity of delay for the electron to release.The plausible proposed explanation for the difference in charge trapping/de-trapping behaviors between nFeFET and pFeFET is by no means exclusive. According to that expla-nation, it is the difference in the relative resistance between majority carrier supply and minority carrier supply that is responsible for the observed difference between nFeFET and pFeFET. Since these resistances are adjustable and can be engineered, the observed differences in our testing devices are not universal but should be typical as long as the devices have a small source/drain contact resistance. To verify that, similar measurements on complementary channel FeFETs fabricated with different processes would be required.An interesting difference between electron trapping and hole trapping is that hole trapping is more related to perma-nent defect generation and not fully recoverable, unlike the electron trapping case. This could potentially cause concerns for repetitive write scenarios, e.g., endurance. Like the study of ac NBTI in pMOS logic transistors [25], the continual cycling of FeFETs will create a complex dynamics of interface defect generation during negative write pulse and possible passivation after negative write pulse when sitting idle or write with positive write pulses. It is necessary to perform similar charge trapping and de-trapping studies on FeFETs undergoingendurance cycling and quantitatively evaluate whether the available ac NBTI models can explain the observed degra-dation, which will be explored in the future.The initial state dependence study performed in this work, in addition to the insights provided into the charge trapping and de-trapping dynamics, also has practical implications. Though in reality the memory write is only necessary when the opposite state needs to be stored, the like state scenarios (e.g., applying a positive write pulse to an LVT state device) seem to be not applicable. However, this is not true. Considering a 1FeFET memory AND type array, for the array to function properly, inhibition bias schemes to manage the half-selected cells are absolutely necessary [27], [28]. For example, if the half-selected cells store LVT states and the target cell stores the HVT state and need to switch to LVT state, then in the VW/2 inhibition bias scheme, some half-selected cells experience half of the write voltage (e.g., 2 V) and induce electron trapping. Similarly, it is possible to generate interface defects when repetitive negative write pulse is applied in extreme cases.From the",691

Ever since the discovery of ferroelectric HfO2 and its integration into FeFET, this challenge has been identified and novel device designs are actively pursued to alleviate this bottleneck [8]. Since charge trapping is related to the interlayer, strategies to reduce the interlayer electric field [9] or avoid the formation of the interlayer are effective approaches to manage charge trapping [6]. The former can be realized through adopting a higher dielectric constant interlayer [7] or separating the ferroelectric from the underlying transis-tor using a metal–ferroelectric–metal–insulator–semiconductor (MFMIS) structure [29]–[31]. The latter has been explored with the channel last integration where the ferroelectric HfO2 is deposited and crystallized first, and then the channel (e.g., low-temperature deposited poly-silicon or metal oxide thin films) is deposited at low temperature [6].

We have shown a significant difference in the charge trapping and de-trapping behavior comparing nFeFETs and pFeFETs that nFeFETs suffer significantly from electron trap-ping while pFeFETs are less prone to electron trapping but show significant hole trapping and interface defects’ gen-eration when heavily stressed. We have provided a plausi-ble explanation for this asymmetry between nFeFETs and pFeFETs as a result of temporarily enhanced substrate voltage drop (i.e., smaller gate oxide voltage drop, thus less charge trapping) when screening charge comes from the substrate (i.e., hole trapping in nFeFETs is less than pFeFETs and electron trapping in pFeFETs is less than nFeFETs).

Though many recent studies have sought to examine general principles of ferroelectricity and stability of various measurements. Direct evidence for the evolution of multiple aspects of fi lm structure during fi eld cycling is shown to underlie the observed electrical behavior.

Figure1 a shows the manifestation of both wake-up and fatigue in the polari-zation hysteresis whereas Figure 1 b depicts the evolution of Pr throughout the course of continuous fi eld cycling. Besides the aforementioned changes in the polarization–voltage ( P – V ) hysteresis (loop opening and Pr increase followed by a decrease in Pr ), the slopes of the saturated hysteresis branches hint at changes in relative permittivity of the fi lm. These changes become even more apparent when measuring the small-signal capacitance as a function of applied bias voltage. As expected from the P – V hysteresis, the peaks in the butterfl y-like hyster-esis in relative permittivity εr that result from additional domain wall capacitance during polarization switching [ 16 ] fi rst increase Adv.

Inter-estingly, the minimal relative permittivity εr,min outside these regions, which represents only the dielectric contributions (no domain walls present), exhibits a steady decline from around 33 to 27. Since this value is coupled to the phases present in the polycrystalline fi lm (Figure 1 c), the question arises whether phase fractions in the bulk and/or at the electrode interfaces are subject to a continuous change during fi eld cycling. For com-parison with the data in Figure 1 a,b, different hafnia phases with their corresponding relative permittivities are shown in Figure 1 d. From the change in these values, the trend in rela-tive permittivity seems to suggest a change from predominantly tetragonal/cubic phases toward predominantly orthorhombic/monoclinic phases. It should be noted, however, that a signifi -cant polarization is still present in the fi lm even after the εr,mindropped to 27. Moreover, judging solely from published X-ray diffractograms of this sample, [ 3,17 ] a predominantly monoclinic to orthorhombic character can be inferred for the pristine case. This seems to partially contradict the electrical",852

Impedance spectros-copy provides the potential to identify structural inhomogenei-ties and their evolution via frequency-dependent small-signal measurements of the complex impedance Z (Z = Z′ −Z′′). [ 18 ]Bulk ceramics, for which this technique is frequently used, are often represented by parallel arrangements of a capacitance Cand a resistance R (an RC element) to account for the dielec-Figure 1. a) Hystereses of polarization P (dotted lines) and relative permittivity εr (solid lines) for the three different regimes: pristine (0 cycles), during wake-up (1000 cycles), and during fatigue (215 000 cycles); b) the evolution of remanent polarization Pr and minimum rela-tive permittivity εr,min versus number of switching cycles; c) a bright-fi eld STEM image of the complete fi lm stack; and d) literature values of εr for the ferroelectric (FE) orthorhombic (O) Pca2 1and the paraelectric mono-clinic (M) P2 1 /c , tetragonal (T) P4 2 /nmc , and cubic (C) Fm3m phases.

In series with this RC element, an additional resistance contribution is usually included to rep-resent uneliminated resistances of the electrodes, the elec-trode interfaces, the cables/contacts, and parasitic elements of the measurement setup. In the Supporting Information S1, a more exhaustive description of this very basic equivalent cir-cuit and its refl ection in the frequency-dependent behavior of the measured impedance is provided. In contrast to mm-thick ceramics, [ 18 ] grain boundaries are not expected to necessitate a second RC element in series to the fi rst one. As Figure 1 c shows, grains span the whole fi lm thickness and should, from a physical point of view, give rise to an RC element in parallel to the RC element of the grains. However, from a mathematical point of view, the two parallel resistances and two capacitances could be condensed into one R and one C , respectively. A unique best fi t for the two R and two C elements is impossible as it is an underdetermined system. Thus, also for thin fi lms, the mod-elling strategy does not change and series arrangements of RC elements are primarily used and then later on assigned a phys-ical meaning in all conscience. Differences in interface and bulk properties, for example, can explain the necessity of two or more RC elements in series. The sample studied in this work requires an equivalent circuit of three RC -like elements and one series resistance R 4to adequately fi t the measured imped-ance",712

These RC elements and the parts of the fi lm stack they represent are derived in the fol-lowing. The fi rst RC element consists of an ideal capacitance C1 and a resistance R1 , with the latter being orders of magni-tude too large to be properly fi t within the accessible frequency 1600173 (2 of 7)wileyonlinelibrary.com© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It can be explained by a TiO xN yinterfacial layer formed during the deposition and subsequent annealing pro-cess [ 25–27 ] or a partial oxidation of the Ti adhesion layer below the Pt pad. Despite the high ratio of roughness to thickness anticipated for an interfacial TiO xN y, this electrode-like layer does not require a CPE for a proper fi t. Existence of an interfa-cial TiO xN yelectrode interfacial layer of ≈1 nm thickness would result in εr≈ 6 for all three stages of fi eld cycling. The scenario of an interfacial layer with such a low permittivity combined with a high uniformity in dielectric and resistive properties is, thus, unlikely. Instead, assuming a layer thickness of ≈10 nm as would be the case for a partially but uniformly oxidized TiN or Ti layer, the permittivity would be around 60, which is in the range of what has been reported for TiO 2 . [ 28 ] Comparing the remaining parameters to the actual fi lm, we see that the high resistance R1 together with a capacitance C1≈ 1 nF (resulting εr≈ 30) is exactly expected from the capacitor geometry and the bulk of the thin fi lm. Thus, the second RC -like element has also to be in a thickness range of an interfacial-like layer, but still possesses notable insulating properties with R2≈ 10 5 –10 7Ω.

Figure3 summarizes the equivalent circuit with extracted fi t parameters at different stages of fi eld cycling and the concluded counterparts for each element in the physical fi lm stack. From this overview, some trends can be identifi ed: 1. The resistance of the electrode-like layer ( R3 , C3 , R4 ) does not change substantially. A drop of the capacitance occurs during the wake-up stage. No CPE was needed to fi t the data. 2. The capacitance C1 of the bulk layer remains nearly constant during wake-up, but drops by 20% during fatigue. A look at Figure 1 a reveals the problem arguing with these values: At 0 V, they are superimposed by domain-wall contributions (peaks of the butterfl y like curve). Moreover, impedance spectroscopy is not able to account for the evolution of the exceedingly large R1 .

The second RC -like element consists of a fi nite resistance R2 and a constant-phase element (CPE) Q2 , which can be con-sidered as a nonideal capacitance. A wealth of potential sources for such nonideal capacitance behavior have been found previ-ously including fi lm roughness [ 18 ] as well as inhomogeneities in resistivity and/or permittivity (distributed in-plane and/or normal to it), [ 19–24 ] which are all possible explanations for pre-sent sample. Finally, the third RC element is given by another ideal capacitance C 3and a resistance R 3on the order of 100 Ω, which is similar to the series resistance R 4. Thus, it is likely that this third RC element is more refl ective of a nonideal electrode than of a real capacitance, and it therefore likely stems from the interface of TiN to HfO 2 or imperfect electrode-behavior of sistance degradation of this thickest layer by at least one order of magnitude for the fatigued sample. 3. The dielectric interfacial layer is subject to notable changes of both resistance and permittivity. Its resistance (both the R2 and the real Q2 contribution) increases during wake-up, which hints on a reduction in the number of defects, but it then drops by two orders of magnitude during fatigue. Interestingly, n (exponent of the constant phase element) in-creases continuously from about 0.87 via 0.91 to 0.93, which represents a decrease in inhomogeneity. These",438

Through observation of multiple regions in each sample, all three samples are found to be polycrystalline containing orthorhombic and monoclinic grains of various sizes, including many grains that span the entire fi lm thickness in the direc-tion of growth (such as in Figure 1 d). Phase fractions are determined by identifying phases in a region with high magni-fi cation images and measuring the grain areas from lower mag-nifi cation images. An example of this process is included in the Supporting Information S6. Nine regions in both the pristine and woken-up samples and eight for the fatigued are suitable for phase fraction measurement. From pristine to woken-up to fatigued stages of fi eld cycling, the presence of the monoclinic phase decreases from roughly 90% to 20% and fi nally to 10%, respectively. The remaining regions are all orthorhombic. The STEM phase measurements have estimated error of ±10% to the reported phase fractions (limited by STEM sampling and challenges in measuring area due to grain overlap, localized tilting, etc.). Hence, the phase fractions of the woken-up and fatigued samples are within error of each other. Measurement of phase fraction using a histogram “counting” method by tal-lying the zone-axis/phase combinations from the different regions yields phase fractions which are in good agreement with the values and trends of the area measurements. Further information on this alternative measurement are presented in Supplementary Information S6. Though the above phase frac-tion assessments approach the limits of what STEM can pro-vide in terms of statistics, it remains a competitive and realistic approach especially without easy alternative at hand.

Lastly, it is worth noting that while the polarity of each orthorhombic grain Figure 3. Film stack with corresponding equivalent circuit and model parameters used to fi t the impedance spectra presented in Figure 2 . Rela-tive standard deviations of all fi t parameters are 10 −4 or below.(1000 cycles), and fatigued (after onset of fatigue, see Figure 1 b; 215 000 cycles) states to gain insight into any changes in struc-ture that occur with fi eld cycling. These numbers of cycles were chosen in compromise between a best possibly saturated hys-teresis (amount of domains taking part in the switching) and low enough fi eld to avoid an early dielectric breakdown of the lab-scale capacitor stack. The incoherent imaging afforded by high-angle annular dark-fi eld (HAADF)-STEM enables direct visualization of atomic arrangements, which is suffi cient to distinguish crystal structures. While STEM is limited in its sampling capabilities, it is uniquely situated over conventional techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) to address changes in HfO 2 structure with fi eld cycling. Since the target regions in the present sample are cycled HfO 2 areas beneath top electrode pad of a few hundred µm width, they are spatially too small for common XRD without special microspot optics. The use of pad-diameters in the millimeter or centimeter range is hampered was not sampled individually in this work, it is a safe inference that many of the orthorhombic grains generated by fi eld cycling here are polar. The Pr increased with cycling suggesting genera-tion of polar grains, and polar orthorhombic grains have been previously isolated in these fi lms. [ 17 ] In addition to changes in bulk structure, complex changes particular to the interfacial HfO 2 layers occur with fi eld cycling. For the pristine Gd:HfO 2 , some grains exhibit a noticeable transition into tetragonal phase directly adjacent to TiN elec-trodes ( Figure4 a). These regions are regularly between half a unit cell to several unit cells thick and they abruptly relax into the bulk monoclinic or orthorhombic phase. These regions are expected to be stabilized by and relate to the defect concentra-tion and strain environment at the interfaces as will be further considered in the",551

In contrast to the pristine sam-ples, woken-up (Figure 4 b) and fatigued (Figure 4 c) Gd:HfO 2 samples exhibit changed and possibly diminished interfacial tetragonal regions, and their presence is often more subtle as they commonly retain some of the symmetry and spacing of the bulk grains. More STEM images of the interfaces can be found in the Supporting Information S5. Changes in this interface 1600173 (4 of 7)wileyonlinelibrary.com© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAdv. Electron.Mater.2016, 2, 1600173www.MaterialsViews.comwww.advelectronicmat.defi t, which suggests the absence of such a layer. Furthermore, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) found oxygen in the ≈10 nm thick Ti adhesion layer beneath the Pt electrode (Sup-porting Information S9), suggesting partial but uniform oxida-tion of the Ti into TiO x. Thus, impedance spectroscopy suggests that the equivalent circuit elements R3 , C3 do not stem from a thin interfacial TiO xN ylayer and EELS shows oxidation of the Ti adhesion layer into TiO x. More importantly, interfacial changes do occur in the thin dielectric layer comprising circuit elements R2 and Q2 , and these changes originate from a strained and defective dielec-tric interfacial layer of tetragonal HfO 2 . The tetragonal phase and the related strained region appear to change and diminish during fi eld cycling. Impedance spectroscopy reveals that the resistance of this layer increases during wake-up (both in R2 and Q2 contribution), although the thickness decreases. This hints on a reducing number of defects in the layer counter-acting and surpassing the effect of physical thickness reduction. Defects can enhance both the charge carrier transport through and the injection of carriers into the dielectric fi lm. [ 29–31 ] This was shown in earlier studies for similar fi lms. [ 11 ] Adjacent to an oxidized electrode, these defects are likely to be charged oxygen vacancies (O ions scavenged from the HfO 2 fi lm). The nonuni-form lateral distribution of this tetragonal, defect-rich interface layer in the pristine sample, explains the observed constricted hysteresis, which is known to result from internal bias fi elds (for a detailed illustration, see Supporting Information S8). [ 12 ] A uniform charge accumulation at one electrode can result in a so-called imprint, [ 13,32,33 ] as was observed by Lomenzo et al. [ 7 ] for a pristine Si:HfO 2 sample with TaN electrodes. Since oxygen vacancies stabilize the tetragonal compared to the monoclinic bulk phase, [ 3 ] the result of tetragonal regions being defect-rich and thus, charged regions is plausible. A recent simula-tion approach [ 11 ] and other studies on hafnia [ 34,35 ] also support a redistribution of interfacial oxygen vacancies during fi eld Figure 4. Tabulated monoclinic (M) and orthorhombic (O) phase frac-tions measured from the pristine, woken-up, and fatigued samples together with corresponding remanent/maximum polarization Pr / Pmax values. HAADF-STEM images show that the interfacial HfO 2 layer under-goes complex changes in interfacial strain and phase presence with fi eld cycling, including some reduction of the presence of the tetragonal phase in the cycled (woken-up and fatigued) samples compared to the pristine. Lattice parameter maps from these regions further highlight the complex interface environments and assist in visualizing strain and phase pres-ence (color-scale ranges set manually to better visualize details). structure with cycling is likely driven by defect redistribution and phase change/orientation change of grains which both alter the strain environment and occur with fi eld cycling.

LeBeau_Cycling_TEM_HfO2_AEM_2016.docx,Discussion,"Combining the electrical and structural fi ndings, the following pictures of interfacial effects and bulk effects that change with fi eld cycling can be identifi ed. Beginning with the electrode-like layer (circuit elements R3 , C3 , and R4 ), existence of an inter-facial TiO xN ylayer with a high ratio of surface to roughness would necessitate inclusion of a CPE element to properly fi t the impedance data. This, however, is not needed for the current cycling in similar fi lms. Moreover, a templating effect by the pre-deposited crystalline TiN electrode on the anneal of amor-phously deposited Gd:HfO 2 fi lms should be considered. During the subsequent anneal, the HfO 2 likely starts crystallizing beginning at the electrode interfaces with a structure more compatible to the cubic TiN lattice which then relaxes after the strain relaxes away from the interface. Evidence of an orienta-tion relationship was found in STEM, and can even be seen in the pristine sample in Figure 4 . Moreover, fi rst principles studies have explored the nuances of formation of higher sym-metry phases (i.e., orthorhombic, ferroelectric orthorhombic, and or tetragonal), fi nding that strain and surface energy effects play a crucial role in stabilizing them over the monoclinic phase. [ 2,36,37 ] The presence of an interfacial layer that is involved in the wake up process is consistent with recent electrical work on Hf 1-xZr xO 2 . [ 9,10,38 ] Finally, for the bulk of the fi lms (circuit elements C1 and R1 ) a transformation from monoclinic to orthorhombic phase HfO 2 is found. Only 10% of the grains were orthorhombic in the pristine sample, but remanent and maximum polarization are found to be 40% and 70% of the value after 1000 cycles, respectively (see Figure 4 ). This strongly suggests that part of the transfor-mation already took place during the very fi rst P – V measure-ment (see Supporting Information S7 for further insights into Adv.

The Bragg-Brentano geometry, which did not give strong indications wake-up regime is governed by (1) a phase transformation of a structural change during wake-up in a similar sample.

[ 2 ] reported that 1 MV cm −1 reduces the ground state energy (not the initially constricted P – V hysteresis. The fatigue regime is characterized by an increase in the bulk defect concentration, the barrier) of the FE phase by around 10 meV. The effect on the barrier can, thus, be expected to be in the same order of magni-tude. The redistribution of oxygen vacancies from the interface into the bulk is expected to result in an additional leverage to surmount the energy barrier. Leakage current measurements indicate an increasing amount of bulk defects in the layer with fi eld cycling. With the applied methods, it cannot be explic-itly determined if these defects act as pinning centers for the domains and consequently induce fatigue, but there is a corre-lation of the onset of fatigue and the leakage current increase similar to what has been demonstrated for Sr:HfO 2 . [ 11 ] As a fi nal note, this work further stresses the importance of optimizing processing conditions to yield interfacial layers that contribute minimally to wake-up and fatigue effects. Previously, Hoffmann et al.

[ 3 ] A 650 °C anneal in N 2 ambient for 20 s was used after top electrode deposition. Polarization and small-signal capacitance measurements were performed at different stages of fi eld cycling using a TF Analyzer 3000 (aixACCT Systems). Polarization hystereses were recorded at a frequency of 1 kHz. A triangular large-signal voltage excitation was used with a modulated 10 kHz small signal of 150 mV amplitude to record the capacitance–voltage characteristics. Impedance spectroscopy was conducted with an HP 4294A (Agilent Technologies). Small-signal amplitude was the same as for the C – V measurements and a point averaging factor of 25 was applied. Details about the choice of the equivalent circuit as well as about the fi tting procedure can be found in the Supporting Information S2 and S3. Cross-section samples for STEM were prepared using either an FEI Quanta Focused Ion Beam or an FEI Helios nanolab 600i. STEM images were recorded with a probe-corrected FEI Titan G2 60–300 kV operated at 200 kV with a beam current of ≈80 pA, a probe semiconvergence angle of either 13.5 or 19.6 mrad, and an HAADF detector inner semiangle of 77 mrad. STEM images were acquired and processed with the RevSTEM technique including 20–40 1024 × 1024 pixel frames with a 2 µs pixel −1 dwell time and a 90° rotation between each successive frame.

Subsequently, 10-nm-thick Ti and 25-nm-thick Pt layers were evaporated on TiN and pat-terned into top electrode pads.21 In these studies, a microscopic external probe has been used to apply the poling voltage pulses and the AC voltage to the top electrode during the PFM and pulse switching mea-surements [Fig. 1(a)], while the PFM cantilevers have been used to detect the local electromechanical response of the samples visualizing the domain structure and acquire the sur-face topography maps [Fig. 1(b)]. This approach allows alle-viation of the problem associated with the quick deterioration of the tip-sample contact resistance as well as with the strong electrostatic effect on the measured PFM signal.22PFM imag-ing and local switching spectroscopy measurements have been carried out using a commercial atomic force microscope system (MFP-3D, Asylum Research) with single-crystalline diamond tips (D80, K-Tek Nanotechnology) and employing a 350 kHz AC voltage with the 0.5 V amplitude. Voltage pulses were applied using a Keysight 33621A arbitrary waveform generator, and the signals were recorded by a Tektronix TDS 3014B oscilloscope.Conventional polarization-voltage (P-V) hysteresis loops have been obtained by integration of the transient current under application of a triangular voltage pulse.

PFM imaging of the pristine La:HfO2 capacitors reveals a polydomain struc-ture with an average domain size of several hundred nano-meters [Figs. 1(e) and 1(f)] and no correlation with any topographic features. To induce the wake-up process, the capacitors were subjected to 104cycles of AC training using rectangular voltage pulses of 63.5 V amplitude and 25 ls duration. As a result of this cyclic switching, the remanent polarization increased to about 25 lC/cm2while the transient current peaks merged into single switching peaks suggesting significant changes in the switching potential landscape.To understand the underlying mechanism of the wake-up effect, the nanoscopic domain structure and its response to the applied electrical bias have been investigated by means of the PFM technique. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show that the application of 63.0 V, 1 ms voltage pulses to the pristine capacitors",246

It can be assumed that this asymmetry is a result of the asymmetric boundary conditions at the top and bottom inter-faces due to the fabrication route.. The bottom electrode is subject to oxidizing species during the ALD process, which is not the case for the top electrode, and a Ti-O(-N) layer has been shown to form under similar conditions also due to the thermal energy imposed by the crystallization anneal.23–25 Another feature worth mentioning is strong spatial variabil-ity of the local switching parameters at the nanoscale level likely caused by structural imperfections associated with polycrystalline nature of the La:HfO2 capacitors.. Analysis of the PFM images in Figs.. 2(a) and 2(b) allows us to select different representative regions to illus-trate this point..

Mu_et_al-2017-IEEE_Total Dose Effects and Bias Instabilities of NH42S passivated Ge MOS Capacitors with HfxZr1-xOy thin films.docx,Abstract,"—The effects of biased irradiation on Ge MOS capac-itors with HfxZr1−xOy(0.43 < x < 1) gate dielectrics have been investigated. These devices were irradiated by a 662-KeV Cs137γ -ray radiation source with 0.5 or –0.5 V gate bias. Prior to irradiation exposure, leakage behavior and bias-instability of HfxZr1−xOy films were also examined. Gate leakage current density increases with the increasing of Zr composition in gate oxide. In addition, Zr-containing dielectrics under positive bias (PB) exhibited more oxide negative trapped charges than that of HfO2, which suggested that the oxygen-vacancy concen-tration in HfxZr1−xOy was increased by the addition of Zr. Larger flat-band voltage shifts (VFB) were extracted under positive biased irradiation than the bias only",203

Under negative biased irradiation,VFB was attributed to the combined effect of the net oxide trapped charges and the passivation of Ge dangling bonds at the Ge/high-k interface. Additionally, both bias-induced and radiation-induced charge trapping have a crucial effect on radiation response of HfxZr1−xOy at each dose level. HfxZr1−xOy is identified as a promising gate dielectric for advanced complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technologies.oxide trapped charges, total dose effect. Index Terms—HfxZr1−xOy, germanium, interface traps,gate capacitance for better channel control, while maintaining low leakage current, high-k gate dielectric material has been employed to replace SiO2 for nanoscale CMOS device applications [1]–[3]. Because of its relative high band gap and compatibility in contact with channel region, HfO2 has been considered as a promising candidate for high-k gate dielectrics in CMOS technology [4], [5]. However, the dielectric constant of HfO2 is not high enough to obtain the continued scaling of advanced metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) [6]. ZrO2 offers the benefit of a higher dielectric constant due to easier stabilization of its tetragonal phase as opposed to the monoclinic phase in crystallized HfO2. In addition, HfO2 and ZrO2 are chemically similar and thus completely miscible in solid state [7], [8]. It has been reported that the addition of ZrO2 into HfO2 gate dielectric stabilizes the tetragonal phase and enhances the dielectric constant [9]. HfxZr1−xOy dielectric is thus an attractive candidate for advanced gate-stack applications. On the other hand, germanium (Ge) is of great interest as a promising channel material for future MOSFETs because it processes higher intrinsic carrier mobility (four times for hole and two times for electron mobility) compared with that of silicon (Si).

This technological issue has been overcome by the passivation of Ge surface, which can prevent oxidation formation during device processing [12]–[14]. It has been reported that sulfur passivation of germanium is very effective in preventing the formation of the GeOx at the interface, which can lead to superior Ge gate-stack [15], [16]. The reduction of interface defects is attributed to the formation of Ge-S bonds and GeS species at the Ge/high-k surface. The electrical characteristics of Ge MOS devices with HfxZr1−xOy gate dielectric have been investigated in recent studies [6]. It has been reported that the interface trap density and subthreshold swing of Ge MOSFETs are clearly improved by the addition of ZrO2 into HfO2 gate dielectric. Therefore, Ge devices with HfxZr1−xOy gates could be promising candidates for advanced CMOS technologies and integrated circuits.0018-9499 © 2017 IEEE.

Several studies suggest that, unlike conventional Si/SiO2 case, a significant density of trapped charges can be observed in high-k dielectrics under long-term radiation and bias conditions [17]–[21].

Consequently, it is important to characterize theradiation response of Ge MOS devices with HfxZr1−xOy. However, very little research has been done on the total doseeffects of these devices. In this paper, we have investigatedthe total ionizing dose radiation effect on HfxZr1−xOy thin films prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) depositedon (NH4)2S passivated Ge substrate.

Prior to gate-stack fabrication, germanium wafers were initially degreased by ultrasonic bath in acetonefor 10 min, and then the degreased samples were ultra-sonic cleaned in isopropyl alcohol for 10 min to removegrease or oil [15], [16]. The native oxides were then removedusing a solution of HF: deionized water (1:50) for 30 s.The finally treatment involved a 15 min (NH4)2S solution(0.1 mol/L) soak and deionized water rinse in order to passi-vate the Ge interface [15], [16]. HfxZr1−xOy thin films with various Zr/Hf ratio, were prepared at a wafer temperatureof 200 °C using ALD. Hf[(CH3)2N]4, Zr[(CH3)2N]4, anddeionized water served as the Hf precursor, Zr precursor,and oxygen source. Composition and thickness of the thinfilms were controlled by the various ratios of Zr:Hf precur-sor cycles. Aluminum electrodes were deposited by electronbeam evaporation with 0.07 mm2gate area. The physicalthicknesses of HfO2, Hf0.6Zr0.4O2, and Hf0.43Zr0.57O2 were20.5, 21.3, and 21.1 nm, respectively, as measured by spectro-scopic ellipsometry. The elemental analyses of the depositedfilms were measured using an Oxford Instruments EnergyDispersive Spectrometer (EDS).To investigate their radiation response, devices were irradi-ated at an on-site radiation response probe station system witha 662-KeV Cs137γ -ray radiation source [22]. After taking intoaccount the dose enhancement effect, the dose rate of HfO2and HfxZr1−xOy thin films was 0.119 × 10−3krad/s (SiO2). A total dose up to 45 krad (SiO2) was applied to deviceswith a constant gate bias of 0.5 or −0.5 V. During the biased irradiation, oxide and interface charge trapping behav-iors of HfxZr1−xOy thin films were revealed by analysis ofCapacitance–Voltage (C–V) curves at the frequency of 1 MHz.The C–V and Current–Voltage (J–V) measurements werecarried out using a HP 4284 Precision LCR meter and anAgilent B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyzer.Fig. 1. dielectrics on Ge MOS devices.

Sample A was grown with the Hf:Zr The atomic ratios of the HfxZr1−xOy thin films investigateddeposition ratio of 1:1 (i.e., every HfO2–H2O cycle followed by a ZrO2–H2O cycle), while the deposition ratio for sample B was 3:1. It can be observed that the atomic ratios of the thin films are 0.43:0.57 and 0.6:0.4 (Hf:Zr) for sample A and sample B, respectively. This indicates that the deposition rate of ZrO2 is higher than that of HfO2. Moreover, no measurable impurity has been observed in the deposited films.dielectrics on their leakage behavior is exhibited in Fig. 1. The impact of Zr composition in HfxZr1−xOy gateIt is shown that the gate leakage density is increased with the increasing of Zr composition in gate oxide. This can be explained by the smaller band gap and lower band offset of ZrO2 compared with HfO2. The higher leakage current density of ZrO2 is identical to previous reports for HfxZr1−xOy dielectric deposited on Si substrate [7]. The effects of the surface passivation of Ge on the leakage behavior in HfxZr1−xOy MOS capacitors are also shown in Fig. 1. It can be observed that the leakage current is decreased after the sulfur treatment of Ge surface. Mao [23] has reported that the density and location of interface traps at dielectric/Si surface have significant effects on gate leakage current. It was alsoMU et al.: TOTAL DOSE EFFECTS AND BIAS INSTABILITIES OF (NH4)2S PASSIVATED Ge MOS CAPACITORS 2915Fig. 2.

The permittivity of gate oxide increases with the increasing of ZrO2 compositions in HfxZr1−xOy dielectrics.reported that the passivation of Ge surface can result in the formation of high-k/S/Ge stack, thus decreasing the interface traps [15]. Therefore, the improved leakage characteristics in sulfur-passivated samples can be attributed to the reduction of interface trap density. However, the leakage behavior of the MOS capacitors cannot fully identify the impact of sulfur treatment and Zr composition on Ge interface states. It is necessary to investigate the interface defects by evaluating bias instability of the MOS capacitors via their C–V characteristics. Fig. 2 shows the C–V characteristics of Ge MOS capacitors with various Zr-compositions of HfxZr1−xOy gate dielectrics. The result indicates that higher dielectric constants can be observed in Zr-doped HfxZr1−xOy thin films. It can be understood that the addition of ZrO2 into HfO2 gate oxide stabilizes the tetragonal phase and shows higher dielectric constant, whereas the HfO2 exhibits monoclinic phase as opposite to ZrO2 [7], [8]. Smaller hysteresis was extracted from the C–V curves of MOS capacitors with Hf0.43Zr0.57O2 and Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 dielectrics. The hysteresis between the ramped up and ramped down of C–V curves was originated from part of the defects in high-k dielectrics which can be repeatedly neutralized and recharged by charge injection from the substrate [24], [25]. Therefore, the",858

In addition, the gate ZrO2 doped dielectrics shows a positive flat-band voltage shift (VFB) compared with HfO2, which may be attributable to the presence of pre-existing electron traps or the lack of positive charges in ZrO2.B. Bias InstabilityAs discussed in our earlier work, theVFB of irradiated devices under electric field is attributed to the combined effect of radiation-induced and bias-induced charge trapping in dielectrics [26]. In order to separate the bias-instability and radiation-caused shifts, theVFB of the devices under electric field without radiation exposure was observed [19], [27], [28].Fig. 3. without irradiation as a function of stress time for Ge MOS capacitors with Flat-band voltage shifts (VFB) induced by −0.5 or 0.5 V biasHfxZr1−xOy gate dielectrics. Under PB, largerVFB was obtained from Zr-containing devices after a stress time of 130 h. Under NB, no significant discrepancy ofVFB can be observed. The C–V plots of the Ge MOS capacitors with Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 before and after pure bias without irradiation are shown in the inset.Fig. 3 illustrates theVFB of Ge MOS capacitors with various Zr-containing HfxZr1−xOy gate dielectrics. TheVFB was estimated by C–V measurements under −0.5 or 0.5 V without irradiation (W/O). The inset of Fig. 3 illustrates the represen-tative C–V curves of Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 before and after different bias conditions. Under positive bias (PB), HfxZr1−xOy with various Zr compositions all exhibited positiveVFB up to 0.38 V. As theVFB was attributed to the combined effect of net oxide trapped charges and interface traps at the Ge/high-k interface, this positiveVFB of HfxZr1−xOy gate dielectrics was induced by electron tunneling from the Ge substrate to form negatively charged states and/or the build-up of interface traps. In addition, theVFB of the capacitors increases with the increase of Zr composition in HfxZr1−xOy. This result indicates that HfO2 dielectrics exhibits relative low electron trap density or interface trap density compared with that of ZrO2. Negative bias (NB) applied on the HfxZr1−xOy capacitors for more than 130 h without irradiation resulted in negativeVFB up to −0.18 V. No significant discrepancy ofVFB was observed for HfxZr1−xOy thin films with various Zr compositions. This can be explained by an approximately equal density of both net positive oxide trapped charges and interface charges for HfO2 and ZrO2. However, as shown in the following",682

In order to further identify the variation of Nit, the Nit as a function of stress time for HfxZr1−xOy S-passivated thin films under −0.5 or 0.5 V electric field without radiation was shown in Fig. 6. Similar to the result obtained in Fig 4(b), the Nit of HfxZr1−xOy with various Zr compositions was all increased during PB, while themagnitude during NB. Nit of the HfxZr1−xOy MOS capacitor was all increased inC. Biased Irradiation ResponseA total dose up to 45 krad (SiO2) was applied to devices with a constant gate bias of 0.5 or −0.5 V. This paper has been focused only on the relative low-dose-rate radiation response of Ge MOS capacitors with HfxZr1−xOy. That is because the advanced microelectronics devices and circuits used in aerospace engineering are unavoidably exposed to space-like radiation, which has a relatively low radiation dose rate at 10−5−10−9krad (SiO2)/s. Therefore, the dose absorption rate for dielectrics in this paper is 0.119×10−3krad/s (SiO2). However, if a total dose of 1 Mrad (SiO2) is applied to HfxZr1−xOy thin films under the present radiation source, more than 90 days gamma-ray radiation exposure needs to be performed at this stage. Some uncertain risks are able to have2918 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE, VOL. 64, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2017significant effects to the on-site measurements system during the relative long-term test, such as probe shifts, uncertain temperature and humidity. The stress voltage and the sweeping voltage were alternately applied to the MOS device during the biased irradiation tests. The irradiation exposure was unin-terrupted during measurement. During the biased irradiation, the C–V measurements were employed to investigate the dose level. The C–V curves were measured by an on-site charge trapping mechanism of HfxZr1−xOy film at each total radiation response testing system at room temperature.Fig. 7(a) shows theVFB for Ge MOS capacitors with various HfxZr1−xOy dielectrics irradiated to 45 krad (SiO2) total dose at 0.5, −0.5, and 0 V. The inset of Fig. 7(a) illustrates representative C–V curves of Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 before and after biased irradiation. Positive biased irradiation (PBI) on the devices for more than 130 h resulted in positiveVFB up to 0.58 V. Comparing to the result obtained from Fig. 3, largerVFB was extracted under radiation exposure for HfO2 and Hf0.6Zr0.4O2. However, theVFB of Ge MOS capacitors with Hf0.43Zr0.57O2 thin films after PBI exposure is not changed significant compared to that of pure PB. In addition, theVFB of the irradiated capacitors under PBI decreased with the increasing of Zr composition in HfxZr1−xOy. On the other hand, theVFB of the irradiated capacitors under PBI decreased with the increasing of Zr composition in HfxZr1−xOy, which has an opposite trend compared with that of un-irradiated capacitors. Since the radiation-inducedVFB of HfxZr1−xOy dielectrics is determined by the density of oxide traps and interface states, the related charge trapping behavior is investigated and shown in Fig. 7(b) and (c), respectively.exhibited the presence of net negative oxide trapped charges as Under PBI, HfxZr1−xOy with various Zr compositions allindicated in Fig. 7(b).

This enhancement was mainly caused by the net radiation-induced negative trapped charges in HfxZr1−xOy. However, the effect of oxide trapped charges to devices is more significant when the location of these charges are closer to the high-k/Ge interface, and the radiation-induced holes are likely to transport to high-k/Ge interface under PB [33]. The PBI exposed to HfxZr1−xOy dielectrics is expected to induce more hole trapping. Therefore, the presence of net negative trapped charge during PBI suggests that the density of electron traps in HfxZr1−xOy is much larger than hole traps. On the other hand, similar to the",153

As discussed in Section III-C, the passiva-tion of Ge dangling bonds can lead to a decrease in interface trap density for Ge MOS capacitors, while the depassivation of passivated Ge-S bonds can lead to an increase in interface trap density for Ge MOS capacitors.At a dose level smaller than 0.1 krad, the depassivation of passivated Ge-S bonds can be attributed to the H+protons drift from Ge substrate under NB [27]. At a total dose level larger than 0.1 krad, the passivation of Ge dangling bond dominated the interface trap density of Ge MOS capaci-tors. The result suggested that a large density of radiation-induced electrons are generated in oxide and transported to Ge interface to suppress the depassivation reaction [reaction (3)] during NBI.As discussed in Section III-B, in order to further identify the variation of Nit, the Nit as a function of stress time for HfxZr1−xOy S-passivated thin films under −0.5 or 0.5 V biased irradiation were shown in Fig. 8. Similar to the result obtained in Fig. 7(c), the Nit of HfxZr1−xOy with various Zr compositions was all increased during PBI, while the Nit of the HfxZr1−xOy MOS capacitor was all increased in magnitude during NBI.Fig. 9 shows the I–V characteristics of MOS capaci-tors with Hf0.43Zr0.57O2 and Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 gate dielectrics before and after the irradiation exposure. The result indicates that no significant discrepancy of leakage gate current can be observed before and after the irradiation exposure for both Hf0.43Zr0.57O2 and Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 capacitors.

It was sug-gested that the radiation-induced oxide and interface trapped charges had no significant effects on leakage current. Another possible explanation is that the HfxZr1−xOy thin films are relative thick (∼20 nm). The irradiation exposure has no significant effect on the leakage behavior of MOS capacitors with high-k dielectrics larger than 10 nm.

Phys. Lett.,vol. 94, no. 18, p. 183102, May 2009.We have examined the radiation response of Ge MOS capacitors with HfxZr1−x Oy(0.43 < x < 1) gate dielectrics under positive and NB. Gate leakage current density increased with the increasing of Zr composition in gate oxide, and decreased with the sulfur treatment of Ge surface. The den-sity of negative oxide trapped charge increases in magnitude with increasing Zr composition in HfxZr1−xOy during PB. Under NB,Not of HfO2 was larger than that of Zr-containing HfxZr1−xOy. In addition, the difference ofNot between Hf0.43Zr0.57O2 and Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 was negligible. This implies that the concentration of oxygen vacancies and hole traps in Zr-containing HfxZr1−xOy is not strongly dependent on Zr composition. More interface traps were generated in Zr-doped HfxZr1−xOy compared to HfO2 under PB, which suggests that ZrO2 presented more hydrogen-related species than that of HfO2. Under PBI, the Zr-doped HfxZr1−xOy exhibited smaller VFB than that of HfO2. This is attributed to the depassi-vation of Ge-S bonds in capacitors incorporating HfO2 thin films, resulting in the build-up of interface traps. Under NBI, VFB was dependent on the combined effect of the net oxide trapped charge and interface traps at the Ge/high-k interface. TheVFB evaluated in HfO2 Ge devices is much larger than that of the Si devices evaluated in our previous study. This can be explained by the large number of interface traps between the dielectric and the Ge substrate. This paper demonstrated that HfxZr1−xOy may be a promising candidate for space micro-electronics in specified bias conditions. However, the biased radiation environment is quite challenging for Ge devices, and future work will be required to identify the radiation hardness[11] R. Zhang, T. Iwasaki, N. Taoka, M.

The 10 nm FE-HfO2 layer consists of a thin undoped HfO2 layer stacked with a thicker silicon doped hafnium oxide (Si:HfO2) layer grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) utilizing a metal halide based precursor system (HfCl4, SiCl4, water).

Thermal Budget Requirements The thermal stress the FE-HfO2 has to endure depends on the HKMG technology used for CMOS processing. This requires ferroelectric phase stability and therewith remanent polarization (Pr) in hafnium oxide to be independent of annealing temperature and thermal stress during gate formation and implant activation anneals. Even though in a first approximation the threshold voltage shift of a FeFET is only defined by the thickness of the ferroelectric dFE and the coercive field strength Ec, the remanent polarization plays a crucial role in the formation of a ferroelectric memory window Downloaded on 2015-11-16 to IP 136.152.208.250 address.

Polarization-voltage hysteresis of a TiN-based BEoL MIM capacitor containing a 8 nm thin HZO layer crystallized during standard thermal processing of a Cu back end. The proportional dependence of the memory window on dFE and Ec is clearly observed in Figure 1. However, as Figure 1 further shows, this simple and exclusive relation is only valid if Pr does not fall below a certain threshold. Above this threshold the memory window becomes independent of Pr, whereas below this threshold the memory window rapidly decreases. Evolution of the memory window with switching cycles showed that this effect is critical within the first 100-1000 switching cycles of a pristine device [8]. Overall, this motivates the search for a material with reasonable Pr stability despite high or low annealing conditions. For a gate last based transistor technology a FE-HfO2 based system has to be identified that crystallizes within the limited thermal budget of BEoL (~ 400-500 °C) processing, whereas in the case of a gate first approach the material optimization has to be focused on high temperature stability (>1000 °C). In the former case the comparably low crystallization temperature of the HZO solid solution [9] and the gadolinium doped hafnium oxide system [10] emerges as a viable solution. In this context Figure 2 demonstrates a ferroelectric polarization hysteresis obtained for a HZO layer crystallized within the thermal budget of BEoL processing without further annealing. In the latter case of a gate first processing the crystallization temperature is no longer a decisive factor, so that in general, the utilization of all known FE-HfO2 based systems should be possible [11]. The applicability of alternative hafnium oxide based ferroelectrics at high annealing conditions will be discussed in the following. Si:HfO2 was the first hafnium oxide based ferroelectric being discovered [12] and therewith the natural choice for a first implementation into a gate first FeFET technology [13]. The observed ferroelectric threshold voltage shift as well as the fast switching kinetic in the nanosecond range provided the proof of concept for this technology and suggested the high thermal stability of the Si:HfO2 in a gate first environment.

Especially the large Pr reported for La:HfO2 suggests a high ferroelectric phase fraction and therewith promises improved cell to cell variability for aggressively scaled FeFETs at the nanoscale [11]. Furthermore, utilizing undoped HfO2, which was recently confirmed to be ferroelectric within certain boundary conditions [14], promises a facilitation of the manufacturing process by eliminating the need for a dopant ALD precursor and the elimination of the accompanying device variability as a result of macroscopic dopant fluctuations across the wafer.

This electrical degradation of undoped HfO2 is clearly reflected in a structural transformation to the monoclinic phase with increasing annealing temperature (Figure 4).

Compared to hafnium oxide with less than 4 nm thickness, as usually applied for CMOS transistors, the ferroelectric Si:HfO2 requires several optimizations of the etch process, while compatibility to standard metal gate etch processing has to be secured. This includes the hard mask stack and patterning, the etching of Poly and TiN layers as well as the impact of dopants in hafnium. The patterning concept may be setup using the standard hard mask stack and etch processes for metal gates. However, the hafnium oxide etch process has to be adjusted to a higher thickness by providing higher selectivity to the interfacial oxide and hard mask material.

Muller_Possible_LiM.docx,abstract,"). ECS Transactions, 69 (3) 85-95 (2015)Based on a BCl3 chemistry an optimized process was found capable of dealing with the silicon dopant in hafnium oxide and the higher stack thickness, while the profile geometry was optimized for steep sidewall angles. Figure 6 shows the influence of the silicon dopant in hafnium oxide during etching of amorphous and crystalline samples. The hafnium oxide etch rate shows a strong dependency with increasing concentration of silicon and approaches the etch rate of thermally grown SiO2 at a Si content above 50%. By carefully choosing the etch gas composition and increasing the etching temperature, the etch rate could be maximized for relatively small silicon contents, like they are applied to stabilize the ferroelectric HfO2 phase. This resulted in an improved selectivity to the hard mask and the SiO(N) interface, which is necessary to stop the gate etch process at the bulk silicon. The etch temperature is a sensitive parameter to improve the total etch rate while isotropic etch rate is significantly increased in order to optimize the gate profile. As shown in Figure 6, the etch rate of crystalline Si:HfO2 is significantly smaller compared to amorphous Si:HfO2 under otherwise identical conditions. If an integration scheme is applied which involves a crystallization of the HfO2 before the gate etching, as it is usually the case for most gate first integration schemes, increasing the etching temperature enlarges the process window in terms of selectivity and etch rate. Figure 6. Etch rate during gate patterning plotted as a function of silicon content Si:HfO2 and susceptor temperature for (a) crystalline and (b) amorphous Si:HfO2.First patterning tests on Si:HfO2 based FeFET gate stacks resulted in a high TiN undercut (Fig. 7a), which was already observed when using elevated temperatures for gate patterning of charge trapping devices [19–21]. Hence, the TiN etch profile was optimized and a sidewall protection liner was used to avoid a TiN undercut during Si:HfO2 etch (Fig. 7b). After stabilization of the Poly/TiN profile the Si:HfO2 etch had to be optimized to decrease footing. This footing is a critical issue for subsequent deposition of liners and etching of the contacts. However, as can be seen from Figure 7c, a steep sidewall angle and strongly reduced footing can be achieved by adjusting the electrostatic chuck temperature as well as the HfO2 etching process parameters.

Compatibility to CMOS Processing and Shared Process Steps In the previous section the necessity of an adjusted gate etch for the patterning of the thicker ferroelectric hafnium oxide was addressed. Even though this gate etch module has to be kept separate, it is still highly desired that besides this marked difference the FeFET memory transistors share as many process steps with the standard CMOS transistors as possible. The most important aspects of such a simultaneous processing will be addressed in the following. A great simplification of the parallel memory and logic transistor processing can be achieved by using a combined stack consisting of the logic and ferroelectric memory dielectric in the area of the memory array as suggested in [22]. This approach allows for multiple integration pathways in gate first as well as gate last technologies.

Endurancecharacteristics and field cycling effects recognized for the mater-ial itself are shown to also translate to highly scaled 30-nm FeFETdevices. Positive-up negative-down as well as pulsed Id–Vgmeasurements illustrate how ferroelectric material characteristicsof MFM capacitors can also be identified in more complexMFIS and FeFET structures.

Compared with classical ferroelectric materials used for FeFET devices [7], [8], HfO2 as novel ferroelectric is very promising for nonvolatile data storage especially because it is integratable into established high-k metal-gate (HKMG) process flows. Furthermore, the ferroelectric characteristics such as remanent polarization and coercive field but also the type of nonlinear polarization behavior (para-, anti-, or ferroelectric) can be influenced by various parameters, i.e., dopant species/concentration, film thickness, or annealing temperature [1]–[4], [9].In this paper, it is shown that variations in ferroelectric properties using different dopant concentrations (various molar concentrations of SiO2 inside the HfO2 host lattice) are not limited only to standard MFM-capacitor structures but also translate to more complex structures such as MFIS capacitors or FeFET devices. The influence of varying material character-istics on important memory properties such as program/erase endurance and disturb resilience is investigated using predomi-nantly pulsed electrical characterization to additionally deepen the understanding of transient effects occurring in HfO2-based ferroelectric devices.II.",931
Muller_AND_array_2013.docx,EXPERIMENT,"SElectrical characterization was first carried out on MFM-capacitor structures, which were deposited on highly doped silicon substrates. A 10-nm TiN bottom electrode was man-ufactured by pulsed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using the precursor TiCl4 and NH3 at a thermal budget of 450 °C for 3 h. Atomic layer deposition was then used for processing of the 10-nm Si-doped HfO2 layer possessing different molar concentrations of 5.7-, 4.5-, and 3.5-mol% SiO2 depending on the chosen pulse ratios of the precursors HfCl4 and SiCl4. Afterward, a covering TiN top electrode was deposited at the same processing conditions as previously mentioned for the bottom electrode. A postmetallization rapid thermal anneal step (1000 °C for 1 s) was used to emulate the conditions of source/drain junction anneals most appropriately. There-after, platinum dots (104µm2) were evaporated through a shadow mask finally serving as a hard mask for etching the TiN top electrode and by that achieving proper MFM geometries. Precisely, the same Si:HfO2 layers were also integrated into a standard CMOS test chip using a 28-nm0018-9383 © 2013 IEEE4200 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 60, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2013ground rule. This again shows the suitability of this approach for, e.g., embedded applications since no severe changes to an existing HKMG logic process need to be undertaken. The major difference between MFM and transistor test structures was that the functional layers of the transistor and MFIS devices were deposited onto nitrided SiO2 and that the top electrode was deposited at room temperature using physical vapor deposition (PVD) instead of CVD. The thermal budget during source/drain junction anneal was, however, comparable with the one used for MFM capacitors and in general has the most significant influence on the ferroelectric characteristics (leaving aside the right doping concentration, which had been chosen identical for all test structures). By shorting source and drain regions, transistors can be operated as MFIS capacitor structures (2·103µm2) and serve as transition devices between MFM and FeFET structures.Electrical characterization in general was carried out using a Keithley SCS-4200 semiconductor characterization system possessing a two-channel pulse-measurement unit. Hysteresis measurements were carried out using an aixACCT TF Ana-lyzer 3000 measurement system.III.",571
Muller_AND_array_2013.docx,DISCUSSION,"To analyze the effect of different silicon content incorpo-rated in the HfO2 host lattice, hysteresis as well as endurance measurements up to 106cycles were performed on MFM-capacitor structures (Fig. 1).As shown in this figure, increased amounts of silicon incor-poration led to clear antiferroelectric-like polarization [10] behavior with no remanent polarization after the removal of the electric field. For 4.5-mol% SiO2 content, it became obvious that the properties were right in between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric-like. The ferroelectric hysteresis with remanence was superimposed onto an antiferroelectric-like hysteresis without remanence. The most pronounced ferro-electric properties could be observed for the smallest dopant concentrations of 3.5-mol% silicon. This behavior is known to occur for the mentioned dopant concentrations and can be attributed to a gradual transition from the tetragonal to a proposed orthorhombic crystallographic phase of doped HfO2 [2].When cycled at the measurement amplitude of 3 MV/cm using pulsewidths of 10 µs (not parasitically affected by RC delay), the polarization characteristics of all samples showed a field cycling-induced transition toward increased remanent polarization and more pronounced ferroelectric properties in general. This conditioning effect, sometimes also called wake-up, has similarly been observed for classical ferro-electrics like PZT [11], [12].Whereas the remanent polarizations of the 4.5- and 3.5-mol% samples are approximately the same after 106 endurance cycles, the values of the coercive fields clearly differ. Theoretically, this would directly correspond to an increased memory window of the FeFET since its magnitude the coercive field and d to the thickness of the ferroelectric can be approximated by ∼2·Ec · d whereas Ec corresponds to incorporated into the gate-stack [13]. This represents an impor-tant reference for memory window measurements, which hadFig. 1. Polarization hysteresis of 10-nm Si:HfO2 MFM capacitors depending on the amount of incorporated silicon dopant. A transition from antiferroelectric-like to clear ferroelectric hysteresis is visible for lower doping concentrations. Field cycling up to 106bipolar voltage cycles at 3 MV/cm improves the ferroelectric characteristics. Corresponding current versus time transients are shown as inset.Fig. 2. MFM-endurance characteristics for the three respective dopant concentrations. For the 3.5- and 4.5-mol% samples, endurance is rather limited by hard dielectric breakdown than by typical ferroelectric fatigue. The 5.7-mol% sample shows no breakdown even after 108stress cycles.been performed on long- and short-channel FeFET devices. Furthermore, the effect of nonvanishing remanence for the field cycled 5.7-mol% sample also served as an essential reference for the transistor characterization.As shown by the field cycled hysteresis measurements, all samples were able to withstand 106bipolar voltage cycles at 3 MV/cm, which can generally be considered as a threshold for the capability of a material to serve as nonvolatile data storage layer. Hence, cycling was continued until 108cycles to analyze endurance properties until hard electrical breakdown (Fig. 2).While capacitors with pronounced ferroelectric proper-ties (3.5- and 4.5-mol% SiO2) show breakdown after aboutMUELLER et al.: FROM MFM CAPACITORS TOWARD FERROELECTRIC TRANSISTORS 4201Fig. 3.

Endurance however does not exceed 105cycles and is limited by breakdown of the gate-stack.106cycles, higher dopant concentrations lead to improved endurance characteristics showing no breakdown even after 108stress cycles. This behavior is known from piezoelectric ceramics and can be attributed to increased mechanical stress accompanying a larger remanent polarization [14].To analyze these endurance and field cycling properties on a fully integrated CMOS test chip, MFIS structures as described before were first chosen to be exposed to the same stress signal (10-µs pulsewidth with 10-µs rise and fall time). In the following, all considerations refer to n-FeFET transistors.In general, hysteresis measurements on MFIS structures are not suitable to draw proper",170
Muller_AND_array_2013.docx,conclusion,"s since accumulation and weak inversion would also be included in the integrated current response, i.e., the measured polarization.. The best way to compare the switching characteristics of MFIS with MFM structures is by a pulsed measurement, more specifically a positive-up negative-down (PUND) test [15].. As shown by the name itself, two succeeding pairs of voltage pulses with oppos-ing polarity lead to current responses representing switching and nonswitching portions of the ferroelectric hysteresis.. Even though the MFIS capacitors shown in Fig.. 3 do not possess a proper bottom electrode and will therefore show different current responses as compared with MFM capac-itors, various characteristics of the current response reflect previously observed field cycling characteristics.. First of all, the current response is significantly more pronounced for the ferroelectric compositions (3.5- and 4.5-mol% SiO2) than for the antiferroelectric-like composition of 5.7-mol% SiO2.. The most severe change of current response with respect to field Fig.. 4.. PUND measurements for MFIS capacitors with increased delay times of 1 s. In general, significantly increased switching/detrapping currents can be observed for the up pulse.. Accordingly, the down pulse is reduced in amplitude as compared with measurements performed with 10-µs delay time.. 105stress cycles.. The tendency that compositions showing most pronounced ferroelectric properties are prone to early breakdown however remained since the 3.5-mol% composition could only endure 104bipolar voltage cycles.. This degradation can be understood in terms of increased interfacial field stress for films possessing pronounced ferroelectric properties/large remanent polarizations [16].. Furthermore, using pulsewidths/transition times of 10 µs and a delay time of 10 µs, it was not possible to identify the proper current response corresponding to the backswitching of the antiferroelectric-like composition (a current pulse should appear for the up pulse).. Hence, effects of relaxation, both for ferroelectric and potentially antiferroelectric domains as well as detrapping of electrons were investigated by increasing delay times in between the pulse sequence (Fig.. 4).. By increasing the delay times up to 1 s, the current response corresponding to the positive pulse remained almost con-stant whereas the one of the up pulses changed significantly, i.e., a significant current peak could be observed.. Furthermore, the response current of the negative pulse was accordingly reduced in amplitude by the same amount..",527
Muller_AND_array_2013.docx,CONCLUSION,"Ferroelectric Si:HfO2-based MFM and MFIS capacitors as well as FeFETs were investigated with focus on endurance and disturb characteristics relevant for memory arrays. Com-positional changes of the Si:HfO2 were shown to influence these characteristics significantly due to changes occurring in the ferroelectric properties themselves. Improved ferroelectric properties with field cycling were well transferrable from MFM toward MFIS capacitors and finally to FeFET devices. Electron trapping from the channel region was identified as the most probable reason for degraded endurance performance of MFIS capacitors and ferroelectric transistors as compared with MFM capacitors. Pulsed Id–Vg measurements could illustrate how the ferroelectric memory window evolves with cycling and that a significant trapping window is superim-posed on ferroelectric switching. Endurance characteristics are therewith limited to 104cycles. Hence, it can be concluded[7] S. Sakai and R.

Interestingly, these materials showed a “wake-up effect”, which refers to the increase in remanent polarization with increasing electric field cycling number before the occurrence of fatigue effect.

Park_CSHwang_pulse_switching_wakeup_Nanoscale_2016.docx,Introduction,"different properties are not clear, which could be further Since the first report on the emergence of (unexpected) ferroelectricity in a doped-HfO2 film in 2011,1 motivations for the deeper understanding of this phenomenon occurred2-6 and the active research in this field for its practical application to semiconductor and energy related devices has been triggered.7-9 It is now generally being accepted that the emergence of unexpected ferroelectricity in this material system is due to the formation of non-centrosymmetrical orthorhombic phase (o-phase) of which space group is Pca21. This phase is not thermodynamically stable at usual processing conditions (several hundred degree Celsius and near atmospheric pressure). The thin film fabrication processes, therefore, appear to induce various (asymmetric) stresses and grain size effects,10, 11 which stabilize the ferroelectric (FE) o-phase over the other phases, such as monoclinic (m-phase) or tetragonal (t-phase) phases. HfO2–ZrO2 (HZO) solid solution system is one of the very promising FE materials due to its wide composition range (Hf:Zr ratio) and lower processing temperature (400 – 700 oC) for the emergence of these functional properties compared with other doped-HfO2, such as Si-doped HfO2, which requires precise control of Si concentration (~4%) and high processing temperature (~1000oC). Even more interesting aspect of HZO material is that it shows wide range of electrical properties (and crystal structure too) depending on Hf:Zr ratio; when it is ~0.9:0.1, ~0.5:0.5, and ~0.1:0.9, the film showed dielectric, modified by detailed processing conditions. Recovering the usual dielectric property with increasing Hf concentration in HZO film is understandable considering the well-known high-k dielectric property of HfO2. However, emergence of AFE property in Zr-rich composition and unclear composition boundary with the mostly FE-like 0.5:0.5 HZO impose a certain conceptual difficulty on the understanding of the origin of these unexpected FE-AFE behaviors in this material system. This difficulty is becoming even worse when identifying the fact that the microstructures of HZO films showing feasible FE or AFE properties are not single crystalline or even a single phase; they generally have small grain size with random orientation and often contain non-FE or non-AFE phases. These factors hinder the straightforward application of several theoretical works based on the first-principles calculation. The involvement of so called “wake-up” effect in many of these films add more difficulties since the FE and AFE properties vary with the number of FE or AFE switching cycles. It has been reported that the FE properties of many doped-HfO2 thin films, including Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film, became more evident as the cycle number increases, before they eventually become frustrated due to the fatigue effect.13-16 This suggests that some of the FE domains are pinned by defects or traps within the film or at the electrodes interface, which are typically TiN, at a pristine state, and repeated electrical cycles make the domains unpinned. In this work, the authors systematically examined the FE property change with electrical cycling (wake-up effect) using Nanoscferroelectric, and anti-ferroelectric (AFE) properties, standard polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis curve measurements and pulse-switching (PS) technique. The former is useful to examine the evolution of FE – AFE properties with This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xxNanoscale, 2013, 00, 1-3 | 1Please do not adjust margins PaperPlease do not adjust margins NanoscaleNanoscalePage 2 of 9increasing cycling number while the latter can gives the detailed quantitative information on the evolution of HZO/TiN contact property, coercive field (Ec), and possibly involved interfacial capacitance (Ci).

One potential issue of this promising technology is its limited endurance, which has been attributed to the degradation of gate stack before the fatigue of polarization in the ferroelectric HfO2 layer.

Fig. 1a and 1b show the atomic structures of o-HfO2 in up and down polarized states, respectively. Its unit cell consists of two types of alternating segments [9,36]: the non-polar spacer and the polar layer, which we refer to as s and u or d (up or down), respectively. Applying the Euclidean transforma-tions (rotation, translation, and/or reflection) in the unit cell gives rise to 8 different representations of the o-HfO2 unit cell [24]. Four examples are shown in Fig. 1a–d, and the full dimen-sional space including their geometrical relationships is depicted as a cube in Fig. 1e.

The high energy barriers of pathways (1) and (2) are associated with the change in the QC from right(left) to left(right)-handedness during the switching process [24]. In contrast, pathways (3) and (4) do not involve such a QC reversal, resulting in a smaller energy barrier.It is also interesting to note that the pathway via the Pbcm inter-Homogeneous polarization switching A simple way to investigate polarization switching in ferro-electrics is to consider the homogenous switching pathways, in which the entire crystal is switching coherently from up to down (or down to up) states. Based on the relationships between the o-HfO2 unit cell (uc) representations (Fig. 1e), we categorize the homogeneous switching pathways into 4 different types, for instance, starting from {su}: (1) ? [sd], (2) ? [ds] (3) ? {sd}, and (4) ? {ds} (see Fig. S1). Fig. 1f shows the energy barriers cal-mediate phase [37,38], which can be considered type (1), is dis-tinctly different from the others, because O atoms move in the opposite direction compared with those of other pathways, so that the polarization orientations can be interpreted in the oppo-site manner [see Supplementary",1078

New class of DWs Homogenous polarization switching, however, is unlikely in practice because ferroelectric switching usually proceeds via culated from first principles (see Methods) during the switching process for the 4 types of pathways..

Here we present two possible scenarios for reverse-domain formation in poled o-HfO2, which is the outcome of the nucleation and forward growth [19]. Fig. 3a illustrates the conventional scenario with a one-segment flip [9,15], with an energy barrier (Uform) of 1.36 eV. In contrast, our new scenario (Fig. 3b) involves a structural transformation of three consecutive segments in o-HfO2, i.e., {���dsdsdsd���} ? {���d}ss{u}ss{d���}, creat-ing (2;0) DWs on both sides of the nucleation site {u}. Intrigu-ingly, the latter case with a seemingly complicated structural transformation has a lower Uform (1.17 eV) than the former case. That is, when a reverse domain forms, creating two (2;0) DWs is preferred over following the conventional model, even when o-behavior in scaled Zr-doped HfO2 [28] and ultrafast polarization switching HfO2-based ferroelectric devices [25,27].Such a difference in the switching mechanism, as shown inFig. 3c, can further lead to qualitatively different",311

Understandably, the switching speed increases as vDW becomes higher (inset of Fig. 3e). A marked difference between the two scenarios (vDW = 0 and vDW > 0) can be seen in the switching current I(t). When vDW = 0, I(t) can only monotonically decrease as a function of time because I(t) ~ exp(�t/t0), where t0 is the characteristic switching time. By contrast, when vDW > 0, a higher order termHfO2 does not have pre-existing (2;0) DWs. After the reverse domain formation, the domain generally expands through side-ward motion.

Contrary to the widespread belief, this leads to significantly low intrinsic energy barrier for domain reversal and so allows rapid nucleation and growth of ferroelec-tric domains. Moving forward, our work provides a foundation for exploring topological DWs and phase boundaries in fluorite oxides. In addition to the classification based on n and vc, further classification of the DWs can be made by considering 90� DWs and/or a number of structural variants depending on the relative lattice vector orientations between the domains [23,43], which unlocks the capabilities for polar skyrmion electronics [34,35] based on DWs with vc = 0. In principle, the approach taken for analyzing DWs in o-HfO2 can also be applied to not only the t-phase/o-phase boundary, but other interphase boundaries, such as, between the monoclinic and orthorhombic phases present in polymorphic fluorite oxide films [36,43] [see also Supplemen-tary Material]. This could advance the atomic-scale understand-ing of the morphotropic phase boundaries of Hf1�xZrxO2 [44]. We anticipate that the new class of DWs and fast switching kinetics shown in the present work may be identified in high-quality HfO2 samples.

In general, vDW and R are exponential functions of the applied field E: for example, vDW / exp �aDW=E�and R / exp �an=E�, where aDW and an are activation fields for DW motion and nucleation, respectively.

Mukundan_TEL_MRSAdvances_DraftFinal_VM_TEL2018.docx,ABSTRACT,"The recent discovery of ferroelectric behavior in doped hafnia-based dielectrics, attributed to a non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase, has potential for use in attractive applications such as negative differential capacitance field-effect-transistors (NCFET) and ferroelectric random access memory devices (FeRAM). Alloying with similar oxides like ZrO2, doping with specific elements such as Si, novel processing methods, encapsulation and annealing schemes are also some of the techniques that are being explored to target structural modifications and stabilization of the non-centrosymmetric phase. In this study, we utilized synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction in the grazing incidence in plane geometry (GIIXRD) to determine the crystalline phases in hafnia-zirconia (HZO) compositional alloys deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Here we compare and contrast the structural phases and ferroelectric properties of mechanically confined HZO films in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) and metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures. Both MIM and MIS structures reveals a host of reflections due to non-monoclinic phases in the d-spacing region between 1.75Å to 4Å. The non-monoclinic phases are believed to consist of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. Compared to the MIS structures a suppression of the monoclinic phase in MIM structures with 50% zirconia or less was observed. The correlation of the electrical properties with the structural analysis obtained by GIIXRD highlights the importance of understanding the effects of the underlying substrate (metal vs. Si) for different target applications.Email: vmukundan@sunypoly.edu",383
Mukundan_TEL_MRSAdvances_DraftFinal_VM_TEL2018.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide was discovered in 2011 in thin films doped with SiO2 and aided by TiN encapsulation [1,2]. Since then, hafnia with different doping elements and alloying with similar oxides have been under investigation for applications in ferroelectric RAM and negative differential capacitance FETs [3,4]. Further, electric field controlled partial polarization switching in ferroelectric FETs made from hafnia zirconia (HZO) films makes these an interesting candidate for synaptic memory devices for application in neuromorphic computing [4, 5]. At the core of these new-generation technologies is an ALD grown HZO nanoscale film which exhibits ferroelectricity when stabilized in a non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic structure [6]. Hafnia based ferroelectric materials are advantageous over perovskites due to their CMOS compatibility, higher bandgap and scalability. Understanding the details of effect of structural phases on the electrical properties of these materials is extremely important for device engineering for different applications. Ferroelectricity in hafnia can be observed in ultra-thin films, even in the range of 2 to 10nm [1, 7]. In the bulk form, the most stable phase of hafnia is monoclinic structure (P21/c; m-phase) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. At higher temperature (1700°C and 2600°C), hafnia transforms into tetragonal phase (P42/nmc; t-phase) and cubic phase (Fm3m; c-phase) [8]. With hydrostatic compressive pressure, m-phase can be transformed to centro-symmetric orthorhombic phase (o-phase) such as Pbca and Pnma [9]. Böscke et al.[1] attributed the ferroelectricity to the formation of a polar orthorhombic phase. Sang et al. [10] used detailed transmission electron microscopy to examine the symmetry of HfO2 and confirmed Pca21 leads to ferroelectricity in Gd doped hafnia thin films. While there are many factors that help in stabilizing different structural phases, we are particularly interested in investigating alloying and underlying substrate effects. Alloying hafnia with zirconia enables high polarization values for a wide range of composition ratios not seen with various dopants [11]. Here we study the substrate effect on structural and electrical behavior of hafnia-zirconia ultra-thin films. From the ferroelectric device perspective, it is important to optimize the process and improve the endurance and remnant polarization of both metal-insulator-metal (MIM) and metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitor stacks. In our study, we focused on TiN as a metal electrode in MIM and MIS and silicon as the semiconductor in MIS. Further, the electrical and structural properties can be altered by processing conditions [6,12] electrical cycling [13], annealing temperature [6] and types of electrodes [14]. We recently reported ferroelectric behavior in ALD grown HZO films of thickness in the range 7-10nm in MIS stacks with a post-metal anneal [15]. In this previous study, HZO films showed a wide range of electrical properties depending on the ratio of Hf:Zr, transitioning from a linear dielectric for 30% zirconia to a ferroelectric for 80% zirconia.",753
Mukundan_TEL_MRSAdvances_DraftFinal_VM_TEL2018.docx,EXPERIMENT,"AL DETAILSThe dielectric films of 7nm thick Hf1-xZrxO2 (x = 0-1) were deposited using a thermal ALD process in a 300mm TEL TriasTM cleanroom tool. The zirconia content was modulated by carefully controlling the cycle ratio of the Hf and Zr precursors. H2O was used as the oxidizer. ALD TiN was used as the electrode material. Both blanket and patterned samples of MIM capacitors were fabricated. Electrical measurements were performed on MIM capacitors while blanket MIM films were prepared for physical analysis. All samples in this study were subject to post metallization (after the top TiN electrode) anneal in N2 ambient at 450°C for 5 minutes. Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction was done at G2 beamline at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) making use of the high synchrotron photon flux. The x-ray beam was in the range of 10.8 -11.3 keV and was incident at 0.5°. The angle of the Soller slits was 0.1° deg. A series of Ω-2ν scans were acquired at different values of tilt of the detectors. The data is collected as grazing incidence reciprocal space maps (GI-RSM) and are converted to grazing incidence d-space maps (GI-DSM) using python codes [15]. Collected GIIXRD spectra were compared to standard reference patterns for monoclinic, tetragonal and orthorhombic structures of HfO2 and ZrO2 from the Standard Joint Committee for Powder Diffraction Spectra (JCPDS) [16-22]. Due to the high stabilization temperature of the cubic phase (~2600°C) [23], the presence of the tetragonal phase is considered to be more likely than cubic phase from the thermodynamic standpoint. There are three different isomorphs of orthorhombic structures that are considered in this study [1, 10, 16, 18, 19]. The TiN layer is observed to exhibit the cubic phase [22]. The MIM sample stacks were patterned to 100x100µm2 for the electrical characterization. The device pads were created via a single lithography step followed by a reactive ion-etch process to remove the top electrode and HZO layer in the field. The electrical characterization was performed via a pulsed based current-voltage (I-V) measurement with a post processing analysis to obtain the polarization properties. To study the ferroelectric response of the samples, polarization measurements involving pulsed switching measurements were performed. A semiconductor analyzer with a waveform generator and fast measurement unit was deployed to apply pulses in the microsecond regime and measure the corresponding current response. The voltage was applied and measured at the TiN top contact and the ground contact served as the measurement point for the current. The ground contact was made to the silicon wafer which is in direct contact to the TiN bottom electrode of the sample stack. The polarization was extracted from the current response in the positive-up negative-down (PUND) measurement scheme as illustrated in Figure 1. The polarization current can be extracted via subtraction of the second from the first pulse and integration over the pulse timing yields the polarization charge. With this relation, the polarization-voltage (P-V) relationship can be plotted. From those plots, the remnant polarization can be extracted at the intersection of the positive and negative polarization (Pr+ and Pr-) with the y -axis. FIGURE 1: Current-Voltage (I-V) example curve. The measurement scheme known as PUND was deployed to extract the polarization. The first 2 pulses are preset pulses to set the polarization to defined level. The following two yield the Pr- component while the second two yield the Pr+ component of the sample stack polarization.",835
Mukundan_TEL_MRSAdvances_DraftFinal_VM_TEL2018.docx,DISCUSSION,"In this study, we have performed GIIXRD measurements for ultra-thin HZO films of 5 different compositions. For studying the substrate effect, we have compared and summarized the GIIXRD data for both MIM and MIS in Figure 2. Pure hafnia exhibits both monoclinic and non-monoclinic features. This is witnessed by three peaks between 2.75A and 3.25A. Pure zirconia displays a pure tetragonal structure. For the samples with 50% zirconia or less we see a marked difference in the aforementioned three peaks indicating differences in relative monoclinic phase amount (figure 2(A-C). There are clear differences in the peak ratio of the main monoclinic peaks (2.86Å and 3.14Å) with the main non-monoclinic peak (2.96Å). We compare the intensity ratios of the peaks for roughly calculating the monoclinic phase and non-monoclinic phase content. The percent values of monoclinic vs. non-monoclinic are tabulated here in Fig 2(F). From these values an increase in the non-monoclinic phase % for MIM vs MIS for 50% zirconia or less is shown. For pure zirconia and 80% zirconia stacks, we do not see any difference in the structural phases between MIM and MIS stack as seen in figure 2(D) and 2(E). This data indicates the substrate plays an increasing role in phase stabilization as the relative amount of hafnia in the mixed films is increased.FIGURE 2: Summary of the GIIXD comparison data of MIM and MIS samples of the same compositions.

Polarization-voltage behavior in MIM structures was also observed to vary significantly between the sample stacks with different compositions. Starting with pure HfO2, the remnant polarization extracted from the PUND measurement is ~0.04 µC/cm2 with a 3 V peak voltage. This is a significant deviation from the expected non-ferroelectric behavior of un-doped HfO2. A significant increase in polarization can be observed in Hf0.7Zr0.3O2 and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 with a wide opening of the hysteresis curve (Figure 3(E) and 3(D)) and an extracted remnant polarization of 0.7 µC/cm2 with a 2 V peak voltage and 14 µC/cm2 with a 3 V peak voltage, respectively. A further increase in the Zr content",759

While Hf0.2Zr0.8O2 seems to have some small ferroelectric component, the pure ZrO2 film is fully anti-ferroelectric in its P-V behavior.It has been well-established that the ferroelectric behavior in hafnia-based dielectrics is attributed to the non-centrosymmetric polar orthorhombic structure, Pca21 [1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12-15]. While there are two other orthorhombic phases monitored in these materials, they are not polar and do not lead to ferroelectricity. Huan et al [24] also reported calculated values of polarization for hafnia with this orthorhombic structure, further establishing the existence of this particular orthorhombic phase for ferroelectric behavior. However, the theoretical polarization values have not been realized due to the presence of other structural phases. Further, it has been clearly established by theory and",230
Mukundan_TEL_MRSAdvances_DraftFinal_VM_TEL2018.docx,experiment,"s that there is a phase transition from monoclinic to orthorhombic phase to tetragonal phase in both hafnia and zirconia. We also see a strong ferroelectric behavior in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 and Hf0.7Zr0.3O2. Muller et al [25] reported similar polarization values for the HZO with 50% zirconia in 7-9nm HZO samples. From figure 3 it is clearly shown that ferroelectricity emerges at 30% zirconia and becomes stronger at 50% zirconia while anti-ferroelectricity appears for higher zirconia content in these stacks. We are also reporting the difference in the polarization behavior of MIM here and that of MIS. The important difference is noted for 80% zirconia stacks. From figure 3(C), MIM stack shows an anti-ferroelectric behavior while the corresponding MIS stack shows ferroelectricity as earlier reported [15]. It is believed that this behavior has a strong structural correlation. Similar MIM behavior was reported by Muller et al. and a composition and temperature dependent ferroelectric phase transition was reported in hafnia-zirconia solid solution [26]. Theoretical calculations by Reyes-Lillo et al [27] have shown the tetragonal phase shows anti-ferroelectric behavior in zirconia as it is energetically preferred. The difference in electrical behavior of the 80% zirconia HZO layer in MIS vs MIM can clearly be attributed to the different substrate and differences in applied stress from the bottom TiN electrode vs. semiconductor substrate may play a role in this difference in phase stabilization. Further investigation of HZO layer of similar compositions deposited with other semiconductor substrates such as Ge and different bottom electrodes would be useful to help understand the effect of substrates and bottom electrode on the structure and electrical properties of these materials.",417
Mukundan_TEL_MRSAdvances_DraftFinal_VM_TEL2018.docx,CONCLUSION,"S/SUMMARYWe investigated the structural and electrical properties of hafnia-zirconia ALD deposited layers by synchrotron based grazing incidence in-place x-ray diffraction and PUND measurements. These dielectric materials with 5 different compositions with 7nm thickness with two types of stacking (MIM and MIS) were explored. Compared to the MIS structures a suppression of the monoclinic phase in MIM structures with 50% zirconia or less was observed. In MIM stacks, pure hafnia exhibited ferroelectric behavior while pure zirconia exhibited anti-ferroelectric behavior. Similar behavior was seen in films with higher hafnia and zirconia content as well. In the case of 80% zirconia layers, MIM stacks showed anti-ferroelectric behavior and the corresponding MIS stacks showed ferroelectric behavior. Ferroelectric behavior was witnessed for 50% zirconia ultra-thin films as MIM stacks as well. Future research focusing on substrates and bottom electrode layer is required to delineate their exact effect and tailor these dielectrics for different applications.

The capacitors show the typicalIn order to explain the above discrepancy, we first note that the classical theory is based on the defect generation on a homogeneous (amorphous) dielectric. However, the mate-rial under study is a heterogeneous (polycrystalline) dielec-tric containing grains and grain boundaries. The theories ofcapacitance-voltage(C-V),transientleakage(I-t),andcrystal growth anticipate larger density of defects related tohysteresischaracteristics,appropriateforferroelectricmaterials.14To determine the TDDB lifetime of the capacitors, we apply a constant voltage stress across the capacitor at room temperature of 20�C, and monitor the leakage current as a function of time.15When the leakage exceeds a certain threshold, the time is noted as the breakdown time (TBD). This use of leakage current as a monitor of dielectric lifetime is standard and widely used in the industry.7Fig. 1(b) shows the Weibull plot of TBD, for breakdown measurements of 35 samples of the capacitor. Here, the vertical axis represents the Weibit, defined as W ¼ lnð�lnð1 � FÞÞ, where F being the cumulative failure fraction associated with 35 samples. As shown in the figure, the lifetime distribution is spread over more than one order of magnitude.According to the classical theory, the slope of the Weibull distribution depends as b ¼ aM,16where a is the time exponent of the defect generation, and M is the number of defect cells in the vertical stack of a percolation path through the oxide [Fig. 1(c)]. For example, if the defect size (ld) is �1 nm, and the oxide thickness is 70 nm, then M ¼ TOX=ld ¼ 70: The value of a for gate oxides of modern transistors is well-characterized, and typically ranges from 0.1 to 1.17Presuming similar kinetics of defect generation, one expects a minimum value of b to be �7.

Since local leakage current across the oxide depends on the defect density, we used the conductive AFM (CAFM) technique to spatially resolve the leakage current over the oxide. Indeed, such technique has been used to show larger defect density in grain boundaries of polycrystalline gate dielectric (such as HfO2) for transistor applications.21The CAFM measurement requires specially prepared capacitor-like test structure whose top electrode has been removed so that the surface is accessible to AFM tip. We scan the surface of the bare oxide in contact mode of the AFM, and simulta-neously measure the local topographic information, as well as the leakage current under a given bias. Fig. 2 shows the",245
MAAlam_breakdown_APL_2012.docx,results,"of such measurements for a typical fresh sample. The topological variation [Fig. 2(a)] is related to the surface roughness, as well as the interface (grain boundary) between two or more grain regions. The simultaneous leakage current measurement on the same area [Fig. 2(b)] clearly shows that the current is much higher (>100 nA) through regions which correlate to the grain boundaries of the surface [Fig. 2(a)].153511-3Masuduzzaman et al.Appl.

(b) Leakage map on the same area shows that the grain boundaries have higher leakage current due to larger pre-existing traps. Moreover, some grain boundary locations have even higher leakage current (hot spots), indicating a distribution of defect density along the grain boundaries. (c) The leak-age current values, along a horizontal line located in the region as highlighted in (b), is shown along with the topographical background in the same region. The current peaks clearly correlate with the topographic valleys due to the grain boundaries.On the other hand, the typical leakage current along the grain regions is at least an order of magnitude lower (�10 nAÞ than those from the grain boundary regions. The correlation between grain boundary and excess leakage current is shown [Fig. 2(c)] for a particular location as highlighted in Fig. 2(b). Such correlation has been observed in all the samples we measured. Thus, the",371
MAAlam_breakdown_APL_2012.docx,experiment,"confirms that the grain boundaries have a higher pre-existing defect density that facilitates excess leakage current through the grain bounda-ries as compared to the bulk grain regions. We also note that the leakage along the grain boundaries is not uniform: Some locations (hot spots) have higher leakage than others, sug-gesting a distribution of defect density along the grain boun-daries. Such distribution is expected if we consider the fact that different grain boundaries have different degrees of angle mismatch among the adjacent grains, and the corre-sponding strain and interfacial energies should also be differ-ent for different grain boundaries.18 To understand how the higher defect density at grain boundaries influence the generation of new defects and con-sequent localized breakdown, we made the following meas-urements. We apply a constant DC stress voltage in the AFM tip, and repeatedly measure the leakage current through the oxide. Fig. 3(a) shows the topographic map, and Figs. 3(b)and 3(c) show the leakage current at the beginning and at the end of the stress. Note the particular grain boundary region (circled) in Fig. 3(a). The region already has high leakage current (hot spot) before the stress [Fig. 3(b)]. As the stress continues, defects are presumed to generate everywhere in the sample. However, since the hot spots require fewer defects to complete the percolation path, one of the hot spots is most likely to experience TDDB breakdown ahead of the other regions in the oxide [Fig. 3(c)]. This",327
MAAlam_breakdown_APL_2012.docx,experiment,", there-fore, demonstrates that the grain boundaries not only have higher pre-existing defect density and spatially isolated hot spots but also appear to break-down earlier than the grain regions, despite the fact that the total area of the former is only a fraction of that of the later.Given the two observation regarding the grain bounda-ries, we will see how this translates to the distribution of the TDDB breakdown. The classical theory of dielectric break-down in a homogeneous material can be explained by an array (N � M) of potential defect sites within the dielectric, where N and M are proportional to the area and thickness of the dielectric, respectively [Fig. 1(c)]. Random defect gener-ation increases the probability of defect as- qðtÞ ¼ ata, for a given location. The probability of at least one breakdown at any given time [FðtÞ] is expressed as5FIG. 3. The topography (a), and the leakage current before (b) and after (c) voltage stress clearly show (circled) that the breakdown happens on region coin-cides with a grain boundary. The stress has been applied using the conductive AFM tip by repeated scanning with a stress bias.153511-4Masuduzzaman et al.Appl. Phys.

Also, since there are already some pre-existing defects in grain boundary regions, the required number of defects (M2) to create a vertical percolation path should be smaller than that in grain regions (M1). Moreover, the area of the two regions, and hence N1 and N2 are differ-ent. Therefore, Eq. (1) is modified asthe device area.21,23,24A reduction in grain-size, however, increases the net area of the grain boundary, with higher number of hot spots and reduced lifetime. Therefore, the theory developed in this paper offers an opportunity to opti-mize this intrinsic tradeoff between variability and reliability of the devices based on polycrystalline films by optimizing the size of the grains as well as the operating voltage that define dielectric lifetime.In summary, in this paper, we have explored the origin of anomalously wide TDDB distribution in polycrystalline PZT oxide that we observed, and have been reported by many groups in the literature.

This explains why Weibull slope of polycrystalline films with significant localized defects is reduced below the value expected from homogenous percolation theory. The experi-mental value of b (�1.5) suggests characteristically high defect density (M2 � M1=5, i.e., �80% defective) along the hot spots of the grain boundary. As we have mentioned that the hot spots are the worst location along the grain boundary, where defect density is maximum, characterized by high initial current and eventual breakdown with stress. Finally, a high defect density at the hot spots of the grain boundaries may modulate the local electric field, and the defect generation rate can be even higher at these locations. In such a situation, breakdown will be confined even more exclu-sively to the grain boundary locations. However, further work is required to",238

Miko_Muller_High_endurance_FEFET_NVM_good_2017.docx,INTRODUCTION,"With the appearance of ferroelectric hafnium oxide (FE-HfO2) the ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) has experienced a renaissance in terms of scalability and CMOS-compatibility and has become a serious contender for an embedded memory solution in 2X nm HKMG technologies and beyond ([1] and Ref. therein). However, at this stage of development and device implementation the FeFET faces some trade-off between endurance and retention, as well as between scalability and memory window (MW). In particular, the key feature of the FE-HfO2 based FeFET - a high coervice field (Ec) in combination with an ultra-thin SiO(N) interface - has proven ambivalent in nature. On the one hand the high Ec is the key enabler for device scaling and retention, on the other hand it challenges the cycling endurance of the novel FeFET device [2]. The degradation of the SiO(N) interface driven by cyclic charge trapping during program (PGM) and erase (ERS) operation was identified as the root cause for this endurance degradation [3]. According to these findings new strategies need to be derived to overcome this endurance limitation. Based on",276

The polarization hysteresis is simulated according to a Preisach [5] behavior, including sub-loop operation. The parameters of the FE-HfO2 based FeFET device used as a reference are given in Fig. 1., with Pr and PS representing the remanent and spontaneous polarization and εHfO2 and εIF the dielectric constants and tHfO2 and tIF the thickness of HfO2 and the interfacial layer respectively. NArepresents the doping concentration of the p-Si, whereas the work function of the TiN metal gate is represented by ΦM. II. TAILORING THE FERROELECTRIC POLARIZATIONIn order to assess the potential use to be expected from a tunable polarization, its role during polarization switching in the FeFET has to be examined. In Fig. 2 the electrical field hysteresis in the HfO2 (a) as well as in the interfacial layer (b) for both a ferroelectric and a dielectric gate stack are shown. Figure 2. Simulated electrical field strength hysteresis for a ferroelectric (blue solid lines, parameters according to Fig. 1) and a dielectric (red dashed lines, samestack, but without polarization) gate stack for a VG excitation voltage oscillating from ±10V to zero. In (a) the electrical field in the hafnium oxide is given, whereas in (b) the electrical field in the interfacial layer (here SiO2) is given. The bipolar gate voltage excitation (VG) is decreasing from ±10V to zero. The simulation with HfO2 possessing ferroelectric properties was performed according to the parameters given in Fig. 1, whereas the simulation for dielectric HfO2 was performed with a similar stack but excluding polarization. In Fig. 3a the electrical field in the HfO2 (EHfO2) and in the interface (EIL) were extracted assuming a program operation at VG = 5V. In Fig 2 and 3a it is readily observed that the trends in electric field distribution for the two stacks, ferroelectric and dielectric, are inverted. For the ferroelectric stack, the polarization reversal from the negative polarization state to the positive polarization state leads on the one hand to a reduced electrical field in the HfO2 and on the other hand to an even further increased interfacial field strength. Due to the fact that charge injection was not considered in this simulation, this behavior can simply be explained by conservation of the electric displacement field !(1) � � ��� � � � ������������ � �� ����������, where D is the electric displacement field and ε0 the vacuum permittivity. Accordingly, simply judging from the analytical description of the electric displacement field it becomes clear that PS is both responsible for the increase in EIF as well as for the decrease in EHfO2. Unfortunately, this is disadvantageous for device operation since it increases the gate voltage required for saturated polarization switching and also affects device reliability due to the fact that EIF is increased.

Below, (b) compares the band diagram of both stacks at 5 V applied gate voltage (blue dashed: ferroelectric; red solid: dielectric). This increase in EIF is additionally illustrated in the band diagram in Fig. 3b. In the example given here the ferroelectric stack already enables Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, whereas the dielectric stack remains in a direct tunneling regime for VG = 5V. Figure 4. Simulated memory window ΔVT (primary y-axis) and interfacial field stress EIF (secondary y-axis) of a ferroelectric gate stack as a function of the spontaneous polarization PS(remaining parameters according to Fig. 1). The data were extracted for a VG excitation of ±5V. In order to analyze the impact of PS on FeFET device operation in more detail, additional simulations were performed in which PS was varied and its impact on both memory window (MW) and interfacial field stress EIF was analyzed (see Fig. 4).For a fixed gate voltage of ±5 V, varying the spontaneous polarization from 0 to 50 µC/cm2 yields a maximum memory polarization axis: The reduction of the projected polarization onto the field axis is accompanied by a reduced projection of the electrical field onto the polarization axis. Accordingly, a higher gate voltage needs to be applied to switch polarization states which again increases the interfacial field stress due to the overall increased gate voltage. window of around 1.3 V for a spontaneous polarization (a)�∥�����between 5 – 10 µC/cm2. Below 5 µC/cm2 the memory window drops dramatically and above 10 µC/cm2 the memory window decreases gradually. Even though the memory window should ��∥�be rather independent of PS due to the fact that MW ∼ 2 ⋅EC⋅tHfO2 [6], the behavior can reasonably be explained as follows: ���For PS values smaller than 5 µC/cm2 the channel surface charge density induced by the spontaneous polarization is not sufficient for the given parameterization of the simulation (this does however not imply that small PS values cannot induce FE-HfO2TiNn++large memory windows [7]). Moreover, for PS values larger than 10 µC/cm2 and for 5 V fixed gate voltage the ferroelectric SiO2is more and more operated in a sub-loop state (PS reduces EHfO2, Fig. 2-3), which effectively decreases the memory window. Hence, the expected saturation of the memory n++window for larger spontaneous polarization even turns into a p-Sidegradation of MW. Besides these observations, Fig. 4 shows that the interfacial field stress monotonically increases with larger PS values and gradually saturates. The increase of EIF with increasing PS can be explained by equation 1 whereas the saturating behavior is caused by the inability of 5 V gate bias to fully polarize ferroelectric films with a higher PS. Saturating the MW at high PS values requires large switching voltages and lead to a further increase of EIF. In total, these simulations show that besides being in general detrimental to data retention [8], a large spontaneous polarization and the accompanying large EIF might be one of the possible origins for the interface degradation of nonvolatile FE-HfO2 based FeFETs [3]. Accordingly, the possibilities for reducing the spontaneous polarization need to be discussed. Due to the fact that the value of the spontaneous polarization is intrinsically connected to the ions and crystal structure of the ferroelectric, it is highly challenging to influence the basic value of PS. For ferroelectric hafnium oxide, the theoretical value for spontaneous polarization was recently predicted to be around 51 µC/cm2 and showed only minor response to different dopants[9]. Referring back to the statements of the last paragraphs, such a high spontaneous polarization would exert significant electrical field stress on the interface between FE-HfO2 and silicon bulk when switched into saturation. Assuming it is not possible to influence the intrinsic value of PS, the only possibility to reduce the spontaneous polarization is by orientation control of the polarization axis with respect to the axis of the electrical field being applied (see Error! Reference source not found.). However, even in case it would be possible to control the polarization axis (texture control or epitaxial growth would be required), there is an obvious drawback connected to rotated (b)120EHfO2= 2Ec 0° PS tilt EIF (MV/cm)80 4001020 45° PS tilt0304050PS (µC/cm 2)Figure 5.

The magnification shows the mutual projections of polarization and electrical field axis (whereas || and ⊥ represent the parallel and perpendicular projections). In (b) the impact of the polarization axis orientation on the electric field in the interface EIF during saturated polarization switching at EHfO2 = 2Ec is illustrated as a function of spontaneous polarization PS (parameters according to Fig. 1). The tilt is defined with respect to the surface normal of the channel. This trade-off is illustrated in Fig. 5b assuming a tilted polarization axis with respect to the surface normal of the channel. Nevertheless, for PS values above 10 µC/cm2 a reduced EIF can be observed for saturated polarization switching at EFE = 2Ec. Hence, the control of polarization orientation is limited for reducing interfacial field stress but it represents one possible approach to improve FeFET endurance. The first",1433

A possible explanation for this improved endurance performance was given in [2]. It is assumed that due to the non-saturated polarization and Ec of the ferroelectric sub-loops, which are accessed at low voltage, the MW remains small, but also the electric field stress on the rather thick interface can be minimized yielding significantly less charge trapping and therewith higher endurance. This assumption is further supported by the simulation",129

Here the programming slope of the memory window and the corresponding interfacial field stress EIFfor different interfacial layer thicknesses tIF of a FE-HfO2-based FeFET are shown. In the saturated memory window regime the system is bound by constant field scaling, meaning that in order to obtain a saturating switching field in the ferroelectric the PGM/ERS voltage has to be increased with increasing interfacial layer thickness tIF, whereas the maximum electric field stress in the interface EIF for saturated polarization switching remains largely independent of tIF. Figure 6. Simulated memory window ΔVT (primary y-axis) and interfacial field stress EIF (secondary y-axis) of a ferroelectric gate stack (parameters according to Fig. 1) are shown as a function of the PGM/ERS voltage. Part (a) of the figure shows a variation of the thickness of the interfacial layer tIF, whereas part (b) shows a variation of the dielectric constant of the interfacial layer εIF.Alternatively, the variation of εIF can be interpreted as a variation of the area ratio between the interfacial layer AIF and the ferroelectric HfO2 layer AHfO2 within the gate stack. However, when considering the ability of ferroelectrics to access minor hysteresis loops it is possible to define operating conditions below the saturated polarization switching and therewith below the maximum field stress in the interfacial layer.

In contrast to the constant field scaling in the saturated polarization regime described above, the increase of interfacial layer thickness in the non-saturated regime may now offer a true benefit. The possibility to significantly reduce EIF by low voltage operation allows for PGM/ERS conditions that are no longer dominated by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling [2]. The remaining charge injection into the conduction band of the hafnium oxide may now rely on direct tunneling alone, which in turn is strongly suppressed with increasing tIF.Figure 7.

The data were extracted for a VG excitation of ±5V. Even though this high endurance strategy jeopardizes long time retention due to the low stability of unsaturated polarization loops, it suggests a possible pathway to a 1T DRAM application of the FE-HfO2 based FeFET. However, since the minor hysteresis loop behavior of FE-HfO2 forms the core of this high endurance strategy its physical origin and scalability needs to be considered. The existence of sub-loops in the polarization hysteresis of a ferroelectric is a cumulative phenomenon relying on a multi-grain, multi-domain state and a statistical distribution of ferroelectric switching events. When shrinking the device size to the dimensions of the grains or even single domains a different situation arises, that was recently investigated by Mulaosmanovic et al.

Beyond the scope of this paper it is interesting to note that the “digital” switching behavior of highly scaled device does no longer support the application space of neuromorphic functionality, for which the FeFET is believed to be a suitable candidate [17]. IV. TAILORING THE CAPACITIVE DIVIDERIn order to switch the ferroelectric polarization of a FeFET, a voltage drop across the ferroelectric layer exceeding the coercive voltage needs to be realized. The distribution of the applied gate voltage within the gate stack of a MFIS based FeFET is determined by the capacitive voltage divider between the capacitance of the ferroelectric layer, the capacitance of the interfacial layer and the semiconductor capacitance. Hence, the reduction of the gate voltage required for switching and the minimization of unnecessary voltage drops across the interface and the semiconductor can be influenced by the capacitive divider of the gate stack. However, simply altering the capacitive divider by scaling the layer thicknesses (see section III and Fig. 6a) will result in constant field scaling and therewith fails to reduce the interfacial field stress which is responsible for the endurance degradation in FE-HfO2 based FeFETs. Additionally, it can be noted that during PGM and ERS operation the FeFET is either in strong inversion or in strong accumulation, thus reducing the impact of the semiconductor capacitance to a minimum. Hence, the only remaining means to influence the interfacial field stress EIFFigure 8. Band diagrams of HfO2-based FeFETs during program operation. A saturated polarization switching with EHfO2=2Ec. is achieved at (a) VG=7.5V for the reference device according to Fig.1; (b) VG=3.9V for the reference device with εIF enhanced to 16 or AIF/AHfO2 enhanced to 4; (c) VG=2.7V for the reference device configured as an MFS-FET. Since the dielectric constant and the ferroelectric properties of a material are rather intrinsic, only εIF remains as a material parameter capable of changing the capacitive divider towards lower interfacial field stress EIF. The simulation",554

The improved band bending with increasing εIF for a FE-HfO2 based FeFET during program operation is further illustrated in Fig. 8b. The increased εIF suppresses the Fowlwer-Nordheim tunneling, which most likely dominates the program operation of the reference device illustrated in Fig. 8a. A further increase of εIF would ultimately require modified FN tunneling through the HfO2 to reach its conduction band. Charge trapping would be reduced to direct tunneling into energetically available trap sites close to the interface. However, the replacement of SiO2 by a higher-k interfacial layer poses a severe technological challenge that was extensively investigated during the",188
Miko_Muller_High_endurance_FEFET_NVM_good_2017.docx,introduction,"of high-k metal gate transistor technologies [18]. Proven concepts such as increasing the nitrogen content in SiON or the use of SiN instead of SiO2 only offer a minor increase of εIF and may result in a reliability trade-off due to a higher interfacial trap density [19], [20]. Ultimately the replacement of SiO2 by a high-k material with εIF above 8 will require the direct growth of a CMOS compatible metal oxide with a sufficiently large band offset and thermal stability in direct contact with silicon [18][21]. This significantly narrows down the choice of material to a few metal oxides, amongst which HfO2 itself can be found. This means that if technological challenges such as the regrowth of a SiO2 interfacial layer after thermal treatment or the availability of manufacturing ready direct growth techniques of metal oxides on silicon can be overcome, the more logical choice appears to be the direct transition to a metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor-FET (MFS-FET). The moderate band bending experienced by such a FE-HfO2 based MFS-FET structure during PGM operation is displayed in Fig. 8c. Depending on the interface quality endurance values similar to the best",285
Miko_Muller_High_endurance_FEFET_NVM_good_2017.docx,results,"(>109) obtained for saturated polarization switching in metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitors might be expected [22]. Considering first indications of an orthorhombic phase in HfO2 directly grown on silicon [23], [24] and the significant progress in the interface-less growth of FE-HfO2 on Ge [25], first feasibility studies on actual MFS-FET devices might soon be available. Finally the rather straight forward approach to alter the capacitive divider within the gate stack of a FeFET by influencing the area ratio AIF/AHfO2will be discussed. The separate scaling of the individual capacitor areas requires the utilization of a MFMIS gate structure, whose feasibility for FeFET devices has already been demonstrated [26]. In terms of a reduction of EIF changing the area ratio AIF/AHfO2is equivalent to changing the ratio of the dielectric constants εIF/εHfO2. For this reason the improved electric field distribution within the gate stack for AIF/AHfO2= 2 and AIF/AHfO2= 4 can be observed in Fig 6b. The improved band bending for AIF/AHfO2= 4 is illustrated in Fig 8b. Considering the ability of the floating gate (FG) to store electrical charge, achieving a large area ratio to suppress charge trapping appears mandatory for the functionality of the MFMIS-FET gate stack. Different pathways to realize such a structure in contemporary technologies are illustrated in Fig. 9. In a gate first technology the enlargement of the interfacial area with respect to the ferroelectric area might simply be achieved by separately patterning the dielectric and the ferroelectric part of the gate stack using the FG as an etch stop (Fig. 9a). Alternatively, shrinking of the control gate (CG) alone may suffice. As a major drawback the enhanced complexity of the gate stack and the reduced scalability with increasing area ratio has to be accepted. When utilizing a high-k first metal last process technology as a starting point for the conformal deposition of FE-HfO2, area scaling of the MFMIS-FET will occur naturally (Fig. 9b). However, the sizing of the CG plug responsible for this area scaling depends on the gate length and the thickness of the FE-HfO2. This imposes a restriction on the available area ratios. Achieving a large area ratio, while simultaneously maintaining the lateral footprint of the device may be achieved by using a recess gate approach as depicted in Fig. 9c. The depth of the recess defines the size of the dielectric capacitor, whereas the buried CG contact defines the area of the ferroelectric capacitor. Restrictions for the achievable area ratio are given by the technological limits of the recess and the decreasing on-current of the FeFET with increasing channel length. Figure 9.

Among them, ferroelectric capacitors and transistors appear to be particularly attractive thanks to a stable and switchable electrical polarization typical for ferroelectric materials.1The recent discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide (HfO2) films2has triggered a renewed research activity in order to investigate the origin and properties of this novel ferroelectric system. Despite a vast list of applications for which this material was proposed (steep subthreshold slope transistors including negative capacitance3,4and tunnel5FETs; pyroelectric and energy harvesting;6electrocaloric cooling, electrostatic energy storage, and thermal imaging sensors;7ferroelectric tunnel junctions),8 memory devices based on HfO2 films seem to be the most promising ones at the moment. This is mainly due to the fact that the material is already well-known in microelectronics and the nonvolatile memory operation was reproducibly demon-strated in a fully integrated large memory array.9In this regard, ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFET)10as memory elements have the key advantages due to their nondestructiveplaced in series with a thin linear dielectric, which forms the well-defined interface to the silicon substrate. As a result, the ferroelectric enables to tune the conductivity of the channel by its polarization surface charge. The two states of remanent polarization encode the binary information.However, a reliable memory operation urges careful assessment of the ferroelectric material. Although the correlation between the ferroelectricity and the existence of a noncentrosymmetric orthorhombic phase in thin HfO2 films is generally accepted,11much remains to be understood regarding its switching behavior and domain landscape. Various studies of polarization switching, mainly performed by macroscopic electrical characterizations12−14but also including piezores-ponse force microscopy (PFM)15,16and the correlation of macroscopic switching with transmission electron microscopy (TEM),14shed new light on ferroelectric properties of large-area films. Nevertheless, observations of switching processes at domain level have so far been elusive, precluding the possibility of an in-depth investigation of the polarization reversal at nanoscale. Here we show that switching of single or a few domains can be sensed in 10 nm thick polycrystalline ferroelectric films when incorporated in the ultrascaled FeFET devices.

Such a detection is possible due to the intrinsic amplifying effect of transistors making them extremely sensitive to small charge variations within the gate stack. This seemingly unconventional investigation tool has indeed already been used in the past to study ferroelectric and super-conducting properties of materials in an accurate manner.17,18 Moreover, we report electrical measurements as a function of pulse amplitude, pulse duration, and temperature in order to explore the polarization switching kinetics.

As discussed in Supporting Information Section 2, these currents are too small to be detected; therefore, the classical polarization−voltage (P−V) hysteresis cannot be used for the analysis. Moreover, in comparison with our previous studies in which large-area devices contained a multitude of domains within the gate stack,23the ultrascaled devices are inevitably influenced by the granularity of the ferroelectric layer. Indeed, the nanoscale gate area ensures the presence of only a few grains and ferroelectric domains in the gate stack, which is exemplarily shown in Figure 1c.To gain insight into the influence of the domain granularity on the ferroelectric switching, we apply short (tPW = 500 ns) write voltage pulses (of amplitude VP > 0 or VN < 0) to the gate electrode (inset Figure 1e), keeping the other three terminals (source, drain, and bulk) grounded. Subsequently, the polar-ization state is determined assessing the VT level reading the transfer characteristics at a drain voltage of VD = 100 mV. When the VP amplitude is increased progressively form 2 to 5 V while keeping VN at a constant reference value of −5 V (in order to program the device always in the same high VT state prior the VP pulse), a set of ID−VG curves shown in Figure 1e is obtained. Only curves after a VP pulse are depicted for simplicity. Here, four different and separate current branches can be readily observed. To better visualize this point, the current levels in the region of maximum separation between the current branches (VG = 0.36 V was chosen here to extract ID levels) and the VT levels corresponding to each VP pulse are extracted from Figure 1e and are shown in Figure 1f,g, respectively. Interestingly, the switching behavior sensed both as a current level or VT shift is very abrupt. This finding is in strong contrast to a rather gradual switching observed in large-area FeFETs we had reported in the past23(see Supporting Information Section 3). Furthermore, while some devices exhibit only a single abrupt3794 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.6b13866ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch ArticleFigure 3.

This strongly hints at the stochastic switching ruled by a Poisson process.It is known that the domain wall motion in ultrathin films is extremely slow (e.g., about 1 nm/s under electric field of 1 MV/cm in PZT).36Therefore, we model the switching behavior in our thin films with a purely nucleation-limited scenario. Given the small size of grains, it is to be expected they contain only one domain37(see Supporting Information Section 1). We start by supposing that the switching is initiated when a relatively small number of critical nuclei are generated within one grain upon the application of the electric field, with the generation rate given by λ = 1/τ in eq 1. Within this picture, the polarization of the grain is considered reversed when a certain critical number n of generated nuclei merge together into a single domain occupying the entire grain. Assuming the nucleation to be the Poisson process, which has already been reported for the classical ferroelectrics27and supported by Figure 4c for our ferroelectric system, the time elapsing between each critical nucleus generation ΔTi will be exponentially distributed asp Δ T i=λe− Δ T i(2)where pΔTi is the probability density function of ΔTi. Thus, the overall grain/domain switching time will be given by the sum of n individual ΔTi intervals corresponding to the number of critical nuclei necessary to form the domain:3796 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.6b13866ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch Articledomains. It was proven that these states are stable both in time and upon cycling, making FeFETs suitable candidates for a multilevel nonvolatile storage. In addition, negative capacitance-based transistors exploiting the ferroelectric switching in a FeFET structure appear to be a promising solution for ever increasing leakage issues in ultrascaled electronic devices caused by the Boltzmann limit.42However, only a precise control of polarization switching transients can ensure the negative capacitance effect, which is known to be intrinsically unstable under ordinary conditions.434.",514

In this work, we report the natural property of ferroelectric hafnium oxide, embedded within a nanoscale FeFET, to accumulate electrical excitation, followed by a sudden and complete switching.

New memory materials and concepts are currently being explored to overcome this issue.1Ferroelectric switching provides a promising approach in this regard.2Ferroelectric materials are characterized by their intrinsiclattice polarization P, which can be reversed through the application of an external electric field that is larger than a certain critical value (coercive field). The switching is generallyreversible and gives rise to two distinct polarization states,which can be employed to store binary information. This purely electric-field-driven process represents an important advantage with respect to other emerging memory concepts.3 Among ferroelectric devices, the ferroelectric field-effecttransistor (FeFET) attracts strong interest due to its simplestructure (one-transistor memory cell), low programing voltage,4and fast switching.5Typically, the FeFET has the structure of a conventional metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor, whose gate dielectric comprises a ferroelectric material6or a stack of dielectrics with one ferroelectric layer.7In this way, the direction of the stored polarization in the ferroelectric influences the electronic transport in the semi-silicon or germanium), alternative material systems, includingtwo-dimensional (2D) materials and strongly correlated oxides, can be employed as well, potentially offering new operation principles and device structures.8 Despite a long history of the FeFET device,6it is only the recent advent of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide (HfO2)9that has opened an unprecedented path to FeFET fabrication at the nanoscale.10This is primarily due to the possibility to deposit ultrathin ferroelectric HfO2 films (<10 nm), while also being compatible with standard integration processes in the micro-electronics industry.10,11Such an advantageous feature has rapidly allowed for demonstrating first large memory arrays fully integrated with logic transistors.5,12At the same time, newHfO2-based FeFET structures, employing 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides as the channel material, are being investigated for memory applications and beyond.13,14However, to achievea reliable memory operation, a detailed understanding ofswitching processes in the scaled devices is mandatory. Therecently reported novel switching phenomena, such as the abrupt and stochastic polarization reversal,4,15testify to the richness of electrical behaviors the FeFETs may offer. In thiswork, we reveal the intrinsic property of ferroelectric HfO2,conductor and, hence, the value of the drain current of thetransistor.

Upon a positive pulse, for which the voltage drop across the ferroelectric exceeds its coercive voltage VC, the electric field orients the ferroelectric polarization toward the SiON, whereas a negative pulse orients it toward the metallic gate electrode.

Polarization down (up) then corresponds to high (low) electron concentration in the transistor channel, which can be assessed by sensing the drain current (ID) level at a proper gate voltage (e.g., VG = 0 V in Figure 1c).

In fact, when we apply positive gate pulses VG = VP = 2.2 V with increasing pulse width tPW (inset Figure 1d) from 100 ns to 100 ms to a transistor in the OFF state, an abrupt increase of the drain current at around tPW = 15 μs is observed. Note that the relaxed pulsing time (tPW ≥100 ns) was chosen to avoid extrinsic RC-constant delays, originating from the test structure design17and unintentional voltage overshoots at the gate terminal (caused by too steep gate voltage pulse edges in combination with imbalanced impedance matching in the adopted test structures) and, hence, to ensure reliable",636

However, in a FeFET-based integrated circuit, the switching time can be substantially reduced to the nanosecond-range, as demon-strated recently.5Indeed, as reported in our previous work,4 larger (lower) VP amplitudes would result in exponentially shorter (longer) switching times, whereas the switching remains abrupt in its nature.Furthermore, it is clear from this",94
Halid_Miko_Uwe_Polarization_Accumulation_ACSAppliedMater_2018.docx,experiment,"that switching under a single pulse having tPW shorter than 10 μs is precluded for VP = 2.2 V. Interestingly, when we consecutively apply several shorter pulses, each of which is insufficient for switching (e.g., VP = 2.2 V, tPW = 1 μs; inset Figure 2a), theswitching eventually takes place after a certain critical number of delivered pulses (Figure 2a). This unexpected phenomenon clearly points to a sort of accumulative polarization reversal within the ferroelectric. We argue that this occurs, most probably, through the successive formation of ferroelectric nuclei (nanodomains) with an opposite polarization orienta-tion, which gain in their quantity and size with increasing number of electrical pulses, as schematically depicted in Figure 2c. The nuclei formation might be preferentially initiated at the defect sites,18,19i.e., grain boundaries (because of the polycrystalline film) and the bottom and top interfaces of the ferroelectric. Following this interpretation, the succession of gate pulses will generate nanodomains up to a critical point, at which the polarization reversal of the entire grain occurs. Consequently, this creates a uniform polarization pathway between the source and drain regions, which turns the device on. This peculiar feature of accumulation of electrical stimuli through ferroelectric nucleation can be viewed as energy accumulation within the material. To some extent, this represents an analogy to the accumulative crystallization found in phase-change materials upon multiple optical20or electrical excitations.21,22Moreover, this switching mechanismcontrasts the traditional binary memory operation mode,where a FeFET cell is deterministically switched using a singlepulse.It should be noted that the transition from OFF to ON state is evident only after all necessary pulses to switch are delivered to the device. This all-or-none behavior can be further appreciated in Figure 2b, which illustrates the evolution of23999DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b08967 ACS Appl. Mater.

(a) Impact of gate pulse amplitude VP: lower VP induces a slower domain nucleation and a higher number of pulses is necessary for switching. The abrupt change in the drain current upon switching is independent of the strength orduration of the individual incoming spikes, but occurs only after all necessary pulses are delivered (all-or-none behavior).

The solid lines are only guide to the eye.the threshold voltage VT with the increasing number of excitation pulses. The VT level remains almost invariant over the first 11 pulses. Then, the 12th pulse abruptly lowers the VT level to a value that does not change upon additional pulses. The fact that no intermediate VT states are elicited by the incoming electrical pulses drastically distinguishes these small-area ferroelectric transistors from the large-area ones. In fact, the latter ones display a gradual polarization switching, which corresponds to a continuum of states between the nominal high-VT and low-VT states,23,24and could be potentially exploited for the multilevel information storage.Note that the accumulation property presented here does not decay over time. In fact, the number of pulses necessary to switch does not considerably change upon increasing the pulse interarrival time from 100 ns to 1 s (see Supporting Information Figure S2). This is due to the nonvolatile nature of our devices.To investigate the accumulation property of our devices under diverse pulse parameters, we performed the",231

As expected from the theory of ferroelectric nucleation,25,26and confirmed by our previous reports for hafnium oxide,4,27the switching is both time- and field-dependent. This implies that longer excitation pulses and/or higher pulse amplitudes will favor switching. In fact, Figure 3 fully confirms this behavior: when increasing VP from 1.6 to 2.2 V, while keeping tPW = 1 μs, the number ofpulses to switch decreases exponentially from more than 5000to only 12. A further increase in the pulse amplitude beyond 2.4 V makes the device exit the accumulation mode and enter the binary operation mode (shaded area in Figure 3b), where a single pulse is sufficient for complete switching. Figure 3c shows that by increasing the excitation pulse width, while keeping VP constant, the number of pulses to switch decreases almost linearly in the log−log graph. These",210

In fact, to obtain high storage densities and compete with existing or24000DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b08967 ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2018, 10, 23997−24002ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch Articleemerging memory concepts, FeFETs are usually organized in memory array architectures (e.g., NAND29or AND arrays5,12), where many devices share the same gate line. If one device in a row (selected device) is being programmed, all other devices sharing the gate line (unselected devices) will experience a certain excitation. Although the impact of such disturb pulses is largely reduced by proper inhibit schemes30(for instance, by applying a certain voltage at the source and drain terminals to lower the overall voltage drop across the unselected gate stacks), a fraction of the total programing amplitude will, however, be delivered to unselected devices. Consequently, upon repeated programing cycles on the same gate line and due to the accumulation property, these devices could finally undergo an undesired switching. This needs to be taken into account upon analyzing the disturb effects in dense FeFET memory arrays.On the other hand, the FeFET in the accumulation operating mode could be seen as a perfect integrator (accumulator). In fact, as the accumulated ferroelectric nuclei do not decay over time (i.e., the leakage effect is absent on typical time scales of computing operations), it counts (integrates) the incoming voltage pulses and emits a drain current spike when a certain pulse count is reached. Thus, a FeFET might be exploited as a building block in electronic circuits performing nonvolatile (normally-off) arithmetic21or logic31computations, which could represent an alternative to the conventional and volatile complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic.Moreover, the integration of incoming spikes and the subsequent drain current firing show a certain resemblance to the integrate-and-fire operation of a biological neuron.32In combination with a proper circuital environment, capable of supporting a FeFET in mimicking the basic neuronal behavior, this could open a route for exploiting this device in neuromorphic computing.3.",517

After the observation of a remanent polarization and hysteresis in 10 nm thick films of 3% Si doped HfO2 films1in a TiN-HfO2-TiN stack, the effect was additionally found in Al- and Y-doped films8,9grown on TiN as well.

Electronic mail: akersch@hm.educonstant. M€uller11showed that ZrO2 behaves antiferroelec-tric: above a critical field in the order of 1 MV/cm, a temper-ature dependent field induced phase transformation to the f-phase occurs. A recent review of the current status of HfO2, ZrO2, and HZO based ferroelectric films can be found in Ref. 10.Although the ferroelectricity in binary oxides is similar to perovskites, there are some differences which make these materials highly attractive for technological applications: the binary oxides do not suffer from a dead layer effect which makes perovskites ineffective for thin film technology. The mid range dielectric constant8of the binary oxides allows switching at moderate voltage, although the necessary field strength required for polarization reversal is much higher than for perovskites.14The large field strength without breakdown is possible due to the large band gap of 5.6 eV compared to 3–5 eV in perovskites.15 Despite intense research in the last years to collect phe-nomenological knowledge and explore the fundamental effects, an open issue remains which is of some relevance for the fundamental understanding as well as for the technological applications: what is the exact reason for the stability of the ferroelectric phase in the various conditions where it has been found? As a fact, the bulk materials have not been stabilized in the ferroelectric f-phase so far, whereas the possible influ-encing factors on phase stability like temperature, doping and other defects, stress or strain, and surface or interface energy are known. It is under intensive investigation what specific set of circumstances is responsible for the existence of the experi-mental observed ferroelectric thin films.The effect of doping to promote cubic Fm-3m (c-phase) or tetragonal P42/nmc (t-phase) phases is well known from partially and fully stabilized ceramics.

However, to com-pletely explain f-phase stability, there is still a need for an additional mechanism since the ferroelectric properties typi-cally disappear in thick films and bulk materials.16In this pa-per, we want to focus on the binary mixed oxide Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 to minimize computational load otherwise necessary for cal-culations with dopants.Since the discovery of transformation toughening by Garvie,17the importance of stress effects causing the transi-tion of stabilized tetragonal into the monoclinic P21/c phase (m-phase) is well known in ZrO2. Asymmetric stress effects have also been discussed as an explanation for the appear-ance of ferroelectric ZrO2 grains in cubic stabilized ZrO2.18 Furthermore, stress effects in thin Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films have been used as a possible explanation of how a cap electrode affects the ferroelectric phase by M€uller11,19as well as film thickness causing film stress variation and appearance of a ferroelectric phase by Park.16 The effect of grain size on phase stability is well known from the work of Garvie17and has an important application in ZrO2 thin films contained in the high-k dielectric of DRAM capacitors.

This investigation was deepened in the systematic work by Park24who found a loss of ferroelectricity for films above 20 nm.In this paper, we investigate the stability of the f-phase with density functional calculations (DFT). Section II describes the computational setup. In Secs. III A–III C, the computed structures and total and free energies for various polymorphs are presented and compared with literature data. The phonon modes and the infrared (IR) spectra are com-II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODSAll calculations are performed using the ABINIT pack-age.25,26The exchange-correlation energy is computed with a local-density approximation using the Perdew-Wang parameterization. For Hf, we use a self made norm-conserving Troullier-Martin pseudopotential generated with the fhi98 generator27to achieve good values for the lattice constants. For Zr and O, we use well calibrated RRKJ norm-conserving pseudopotentials from the Opium pro-ject.31The levels Hf(5s,5p,5d,6s), Zr(4s,4p,4d,5s), and O(2s,2p) are treated as valence states with the following atomic valence configurations for the reference state: Hf(5s25p65d26s2), Zr(4s24p64d05s0), and O(2s22p4). For Hf, core radii of 1.3 a0, 1.8 a0, and 2.7 a0 (Bohr radii) are cho-sen to describe angular waves from s to d. For Zr, the cutoff radii were 1.58 a0, 1.73 a0, and 1.79 a0 whereas for the O pseudopotential, a cutoff radius of 1.50 a0 for both s and p waves is applied. We also adopted a separable form for the pseudopotentials treating the following angular momentum waves as local: s for Hf, f for Zr, and p for O. For Hf, a non-linear core correction of radius 1.05 a0 was used.28 The Brillouin zone is sampled using the Monkhorst-Pack29scheme with a 6 � 6 � 6 k-point grid for all 12 atomic phases and a 3 � 6 � 6 for the 24 atomic orthorhombic Pbca phase (o-phase). The cutoff energy Ecut of the plane-wave expansion was fixed at 30 Ha. For the calculation of the pho-non modes, a 2 � 2 � 2 q-point grid was calculated and inter-polated to a 30 � 30 � 30 grid.30Integration of the phonon density of states yields the free energy. All parameters were carefully tested for convergence. The acoustic sum rule was imposed.HZO cells are constructed by replacing 50% of Zr atoms in ZrO2 with Hf. There are two inequivalent possibilities to build such a cell, but the difference in total energy and other properties between both is negligible small. To save CPU time, we choose one (see SI,32Table SI) for our calculations.Berry phase calculations were performed under an incre-mentally increasing electric field to study the effect of an external electrical field on m-, t-, and f-phase cells. Structural relaxations are performed after each increase of 1 MV/cm in electric field strength.puted as well. Since absolute values for total energies in III.",884

Besides the difference of the lattice angle b, the main distinction between the m- and the f-phase is a polarization dependent displacement of the O1 atom in z-direction. The o-phase is closely related to the f-phase because the 24 atomic cell is composed of two oppositely polarized 12 atomic f-phase cells.

The a- and b-direc-tions of length 5.06 A˚ conform to the b- and c-directions of the f-phase of length 5.04 A˚ and 5.06 A˚ . The remaining two possibilities of a match: transformation (a(t), c(t), b(t)) ! (b(f), a(f), c(f)) (choice in Table I) and c(f)and b(f)inverted are obviously equivalent. Therefore, a t ! f transformation requires only a moderate elongation of the c(t)-axis and no significant modification of the a(t)and b(t)axis and could be promoted with a strain in the xz- or yz-plane. Crucial is the strain energy of the m- and o-phase since these start with the lowest energy from the beginning. The relative orientation between the m- and t-phase has been widely discussed in the literature in context of transformation toughening. Our choice for m ! t in Table I corresponds to the findings of42,43(a(m), b(m), c(m)) ! (a(t), c(t), b(t)). An alternative ori-entation (a(m), b(m), c(m)) ! (a(t), b(t), c(t)) was favored by Luo et al.34while he was looking for the smallest transition barrier between the m- and t-phase. We have calculated the total energy DU for the xz- and yz-strain planes, and all phases for the chosen orientation. The values of the lattice constants and the corresponding cell areas A have been cho-sen by modifying the in plane stress. In equilibrium, the grains should then adopt the crystal phase with the minimum Helmholtz free energy. In Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), we show theFIG. 5.

Unfortunately, for such an orientation, the polarization direction is within the thin film plane. Therefore, the grains cannot be polarized by an external electric field perpendicular to the thin film plane and an existing polariza-tion cannot be detected.So far the strain was oriented in the x, y, and z directions only. Tipping the c-axis out of the plane so that a measurable polarization could remain was suggested by Park.16In Fig. 6, we have calculated how an angle of 45�affects the phase sta-bility by rotating the stress tensor around the x-axis. No dis-tinction between m-phase and m0-phase is necessary, since both orientations fall upon each other. A window of stability opens for the f-phase (compared to Fig. 5), but the crossover points to the m-phase are located at a corresponding stress of 8 GPa for HZO and 7 GPa for ZrO2. Based on the high corre-sponding stress values for crossover points indicated by our calculations, we conclude that the film stress is unlikely the most important factor to cause a phase stabilization of the f-phase with a metastable polarization along the directionThe remaining question is whether the calculations are consistent with the conditions of the first",312

The surface energies c of m- and t-ZrO2 20,21 as well as m-HfO2 23 have been meas-ured, leading to a consensus at least about the range of the val-ues between 2 and 4 J/m2. Surface energies c have also been calculated for various orientations by Christensen22and range between 1.246–2.464 J/m2for m-ZrO2 and 1.239–1.694 J/m2 for t-ZrO2, but the medium surface orientation of the grains is not known.

The surface energy introduces a further dependence in the Helmholtz free energy Fc (or the Gibbs energy Gc, when the pressure is included) and the phase stability of nanocrystals of surface area X is determined fromFc¼ F þ cX ¼ U – TS þ cX: (5)The requisite for the existence of t-ZrO2 nanocrystallites is a smaller surface energy compared to the m-phase, which is confirmed by the data in Table V and consistent with a size driven phase transformation and energy crossover below a di-ameter of about 24nm.62In the case of HfO2, the energy cross-over to the t-phase has been observed below about 3 nm.63The surface energy is also dependent on the termination with H or OH (anhydrous or hydrous) or other radicals. As a conse-quence, an exposure of tetragonally stabilized ZrO2 with water could lead to a transformation back to the m-phase, an effect known as low-temperature degradation.64Finally, the surface energies have been measured in powder, whereas many appli-cations use nanocrystalline thin films with additional effects from interface energy. The essential observation in the size driven m ! t transformation in ZrO2 compared to HfO2 is that in HfO2 a much larger surface area to volume ratio is required. This implies a smaller difference between the surface energy of the m- and t-phase in HfO2 compared to ZrO2.Since our question concerns the stability of the f-phase we need values for the surface energy of all the competingTABLE V.

The choice has been guided by the existing data, most importantly by the smaller difference of c (m-HfO2) and c (t-HfO2) com-pared to c (m-ZrO2) and c (t-ZrO2).

The crossover of HfO2 from the high symmetry phases to the low symmetric m-phase happens for film thickness below 5 nm.. The model predicts ferroelectric HfO2 for a grain size between 3 nm and 5 nm, for smaller grains the t-phase and c-phase.. For HZO, a similar crossover exists but is shifted to larger grain size.. The ferroelectric films exist in the thickness regime between 8 nm and 16 nm.. Thinner films or smaller grains occur in the t-phase.. In addition, our model suggests the existence of a ferroelectric phase in epitaxial HZO below a critical film strength of about 5 nm..

We decided for the LDA func-tional and norm-conserving TM pseudopotentials. The tem-perature dependent Helmholtz free energy was calculated accordingly. As a first possible mechanism to stabilize the ferroelectric phase we investigated the film strain. Although we could reproduce all relevant stress and strain dependent phenomena in HfO2 and ZrO2 with our model, we only found a small window of rather high compressive film strain to allow a stabilization of the ferroelectric phase. Since the thus stabilized structure has a polarization in the strain plane, which is unobservable, we found the stress/strain mechanism unlikely to be the major cause of the stabilization. As a sec-ond possible mechanism, we investigated the surface energy contribution to the Helmholtz free energy. Since the surface energy of ferroelectric grains has not been measured or cal-culated so far we build a phenomenological model for all polymorphs and all stoichiometry values by interpolating between existing values using decreasing values for increas-ing crystal symmetry. With the Gibbs/Helmholtz free energy model containing an ab initio computed part for total energy, entropy, stress, or strain, and a phenomenological part for the surface energy, we could reproduce the observed phases for nanosized thin films and grains and found stable ferro-electric HZO in a size window around 10 nm at room tem-perature in the absence of strain. Based on the model, we furthermore predict a similar ferroelectric window in HfO2 around 4 nm and below 5 nm in epitaxial HZO. For ZrO2, no stable ferroelectric nanosized grains exist. After calculating the field dependent contribution to the Helmholtz free energy self-consistently, we found an electric field of about 1 MV/ cm sufficient to give ferroelectric grains of 9 nm at room temperature the lowest Helmholtz free energy.

The bulk phase diagram allows for a monoclinic to cubic phase transition by passing through a coexistence region of both phases.18At temperatures above 1350 K, an intermediate tetragonal phase has to be considered. How-ever, when Y:HfO2 is crystallized by rapid thermal processes(RTP) with fast cooling rates, such as those utilized in micro-electronic applications, the diffusion of dopant atoms is lim-ited and a number of metastable phases can be formed.Yashima et al.19and Fujimori et al.20observed metastable tetragonal phases (t’ and t’’) in quenched Y:HfO2 bulk sam-ples between 10 and 13 mol% YO1.5. Furthermore, they described the occurrence of two lower symmetry phases, c1 and c2, that were only identifiable by Raman Spectroscopy for lower YO1.5 admixture. In addition, recent publications report the existence of a possibly orthorhombic=monoclinic phase mixture that forms prior to complete stabilization of the cubic phase in Y:HfO2 thin films.21,22 In this paper we investigate the electronic properties of metastable crystalline phases in Y:HfO2 thin films, and report the observation of ferroelectricity. We demonstrate that a spontaneous polarization in HfO2 can be provoked by YO1.5 admixture, while at the same time easing some of the processing constrains present in the previously published systems.

The ALD process was based on the commercially available metal or-ganic precursors tetrakis(ethylmethylamino)hafnium (TEMAH) and tris(methylcyclopentadienyl)yttrium (Y(MeCp)3). Ozonewas used as the oxidant and argon as the purge and carriergas. The YO1.5 content in HfO2 was defined by varying the cycle ratio of the precursors and monitored by inline X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Rutherford backscat-tering (RBS). A constant thickness of 10 nm for all films was achieved by adjusting the number of Hf:Y super cycles, and was confirmed by inline spectral ellipsometry and HR-TEM. Crystallization of the as deposited amorphous Y:HfO2 thin films was induced by a 600�C=20 s=N2 RTP step, referred to in text as post deposition anneal (PDA). Samples annealed after room temperature deposition of a 4 nm physical vapor deposited (PVD) TiN top electrode are referred to in the text as samples treated with post metallization anneal (PMA). Samples with yttrium concentrations ranging from 2.3 to 12.3 mol% YO1.5 in HfO2 were manufactured using both schemes (Fig. 1(a)). This allowed access to the range of met-astable phases formed from almost pure hafnium oxide to fully cubic Y:HfO2. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) on crystalline and high temperature X-ray diffrac-tion (HT-XRD) on as deposited Y:HfO2 thin films was meas-ured on a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer using Cu K-alpha radiation from a Cu tube operated at 40 kV/40 mA.

During temperature ramp up, in situ GI-XRD measurements were performed.For electrical measurements, Pt dots were evaporated on to the TiN top electrode, forming structured metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors in a subsequent etching step. For samples that received PDA treatment, Pt dots were directly evaporated on top of the Y:HfO2 thin film. Polarization hys-teresis was characterized using an aixACCT TF Analyzer 2000 system and a custom built setup at a frequency of 1 kHz. The small signal capacitance-voltage characteristics of the MIM capacitors were determined with an Agilent 4284 LCR Meter.

Muller_Miko_FRAM_IWM_2014.docx,Abstract,"— In this paper the potential of hafnium oxide as a CMOS-compatible ferroelectric for future memory applications is assessed. The high coercive field strength of ferroelectric hafnium oxide is identified as a key parameter being crucial to device performance. It provides the unique thickness and lateral scaling potential of this novel ferroelectric, while at the same time compromises its endurance properties due to large switching fields. Considering the ambivalent nature of this parameter as well as the emerging trade-off between retention and endurance, voltage controlled operation modes and different device concepts the exceptionally high coercive field strength Ec of FE-HfO2, preserving the memory window at reduced thickness (Figure 1b). Moreover, in the case of the capacitor based solution, the thickness scalability of ferroelectric HfO2 and the availability of mature thin film technologies allow for an area enhancement to the third dimension (Figure 1d). In this paper we critically review the current status of this disruptive technology and assess its future potential by exercising general scaling considerations and device simulations. for ferroelectric hafnium oxide are discussed.

Muller_Miko_FRAM_IWM_2014.docx,INTRODUCTION,"The first research and development efforts focusing on ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) were started more than 60 years ago [1]. Even though new and promising nonvolatile device concepts have emerged since then, the right to exist for FRAM is still provided by its excellent energy efficiency, fast rewrite speed and low voltage operation capability. Compared to the heat induced switching in PCRAM, spin transfer in STTRAM, ion conduction in RRAM or hot electron injection in NOR-FLASH, the electron efficiency of the polarization induced displacement current in FRAM remains unchallenged. Nevertheless, besides some temporary upturns and the launch of a few niche products, the focus of attention has notably shifted away from FRAM. This is mainly due to the challenging integration and limited scalability of capacitor-based (1T-1C) as well as transistor-based (1T) ferroelectric memory cells [2, 3]. These issues are decisive upon the future of FRAM and can be traced back to the choice of the ferroelectric itself. The commonly utilized perovskites, e.g. PZT or SBT, do not provide the thickness scalability and CMOS-compatibility required for cost efficient, high density 1T-1C or 1T memory solutions (Figure 1 a and c). However, utilizing ferroelectric hafnium oxide (FE-HfO2) based memory devices, this scaling and integration dilemma can be overcome [4 and",307
Muller_Miko_FRAM_IWM_2014.docx,experiment,"al observation of polarization hysteresis in hafnium oxide based thin films is believed to be due to the appearance of a ferroelectric phase in this system.. However, in order to fulfill the criteria for genuine structural ferroelectricity a deviation from the well-known centrosymmetric polymorphism (monoclinic-tetragonal-cubic) of crystalline hafnium oxide is required.. It is argued that this deviation is the stabilization of an orthorhombic and non-centrosymmetric phase in hafnium oxide thin films.. Due to the displacement of oxygen anions against the cation sub lattice a spontaneous and switchable polarization evolves.. Structurally this phase has already been identified in ZrO2-based ceramics in 1989, but was never tested electrically [5].. The rediscovery of this phase in hafnium oxide thin films in 2011 revealed the potential of these CMOS-compatible transition metal oxides as a novel class of ferroelectrics.. A summary of electrical, electromechanical, as well as structural evidence for this hypothesis is given in [4, 6].. As shown in Figure 2, multiple dopants facilitating the stabilization of this ferroelectric phase have been identified [4].. Other parameters, such as e.g.. grain size, can additionally be utilized to partially stabilize a ferroelectric phase in pure HfO2 as well (to be published elsewhere).. Depending on how well the doping level and/or process is optimized a large ferroelectric phase fraction and therewith a large remanent polarization Pr can be obtained.. Values as high as 45 µC/cm2 for e.g.. the La doped system have already been demonstrated.. However, switching the polarization to the opposite polarity requires comparably large fields.. The coercive field of all hafnium oxide based system investigated so far ranges between 1 and 2 MV/cm..

Muller_Miko_FRAM_IWM_2014.docx,introduction,"of a suitable ferroelectric: •The memory window is directly proportional to dFE and Ec. Loss of memory window with decreasing dFE can only be compensated with increasing Ec. Solution: The exceptionally high Ec of FE-HfO2 allows for a reduction of dFE to the single digit nanometer range (e.g. Figure 1b). •Depolarization field increases with decreasing dFE. Retention loss can only be compensated by increasing either EC, interface capacitance or substrate doping. Solution: The CMOS compatibility of FE-HfO2 allows for a thin, high capacitance interfacial layer, which together with the high Ec reduces retention loss at scaled dFE. •Ferroelectric properties of the polycrystalline perovskites were found to degrade with decreasing dFE. A ferroelectric, stable with respect to thickness reduction needs to be implemented. Solution: The ferroelectric properties of FE-HfO2 have proven stable down to film thicknesses of 5 nm. Utilizing these clear advantages, FE-HfO2 based FeFETs have been successfully implemented at the 28 nm node ([7], Figure 1b).

Muller_Miko_FRAM_IWM_2014.docx,introduction,"of this memory concept. This memory technology is now capable of scaling alongside CMOS, and can be considered a promising candidate for embedded memory applications in future HKMG technologies. However, for scaling beyond the 28 nm technology node, several aspects, such as memory window requirements and transistor technology have to be considered. Especially in the case of an embedded memory it is most desirable to adopt the transistor technology of the corresponding CMOS platform. The scaling considerations depicted in Figure 4 (not drawn to scale) assume a memory window of 1 V, which leads to a ferroelectric film thickness of at least 5 nm. Short channel effects and the actual availability of the platforms are excluded from these considerations. Given the feasibility of a gate length to stack height ratio of LG 28 nm / dFE 10 nm demonstrated in [7], a reduction to LG 14 nm / dFE 5 nm in high-k first / metal last technology (half replacement gate) seems possible (Figure 4a). However, considering the spacer sidewall coverage in high-k last / metal last technology (full replacement gate), a similar reduction of gate length is not possible (see critical dimension illustrated in Figure 4b). Without the suppression or recess of this sidewall coverage the gate fill is no longer possible, and the full replacement gate FeFET does not fully scale beyond the 2X nm node. A similar limitation with a different critical dimension appears when assessing FinFET technology as a host for the FE-HfO2-based FeFETs (the 3D capability of FE-HfO2 required for FinFET integration has already been summarized in the previous section). Due to the",348

(c) FinFET The implementation of FE-HfO2 based FeFETs as an embedded memory for HKMG CMOS technology is especially appealing due to the large similarities of the memory and logic transistors. Due to the high flexibility of FE-HfO2 with respect to electrode material and thermal budget (gate first/gate last), the only requirement for the memory transistor is a thicker and crystalline HfO2. Every other material or gate stack design aspect of HKMG may remain unchanged. Several combinations of CMOS and memory transistor integration flows requiring only 1-2 additional lithographic masks are thinkable. As an example, Figure 5 shows a combination of a FeFET first (half replacement gate) and CMOS last (full replacement gate) integration. As",752

However, polarization sub loops at reduced switching voltage were found to be prone to depolarization and therewith retention loss within the bake period.. Opposite state retention and therewith imprint characteristics were found to be comparable to PZT after 1000 h bake at 125°C.. About 75% of the initial polarization was still achievable for the inverse state after testing.. At the current development stage the endurance of saturated polarization states was found to be limited to about 109 switching cycles.. Hard breakdown (HBD) of the ferroelectric was identified as the failure mechanism limiting endurance.. For unsaturated polarization loops about two orders of magnitude higher endurance and the onset of classical ferroelectric fatigue was observed.. Since in order to achieve sufficient retention saturated polarization loops are required, the endurance of FE-HfO2 at high switching fields needs to be improved.. Due to the destructive read operation of classical 1T-1C FRAM this is a requirement for achieving read endurance beyond the currently possible 109 switching cycles..",313

However, endurance characteristics were limited to 104 program / erase cycles which was explained by the degradation of the interfacial layer [21]. Considering the band diagram for the respective gate stack and program / erase conditions at a gate voltage of ±5V (see Figure 6a), severe charge injection can be anticipated from Fowler-Nordheim or direct tunneling alone. Moreover and compared to classical ferroelectrics, simulations show that even though the FE-HfO2 is much more resilient towards depolarization [6], still a significant reduction of spontaneous polarization PS occurs when the gate voltage VG returns to zero (see Fig. 6a bottom left). Recently it was demonstrated that the endurance characteristics of FE-HfO2-based FeFETs can indeed be improved by implementation of different gate stack geometries and operating conditions [18]. By increasing the ferroelectric and interfacial layer thickness to 30 nm and 3 nm respectively and operating the devices at ±4V VG, endurance characteristics of up to 1012 cycles could be demonstrated. Assuming similar ferroelectric properties of the utilized Zr:HfO2 composition [22] and Si:HfO2, simulations reveal that charge injection is quite unlikely, which is, however, caused by the fact that the FeFET is polarized in a severe subloop state (see Figure 6b). This is also reflected in a small memory window of approximately 300 mV which coincides well with",342
Muller_Miko_FRAM_IWM_2014.docx,experiment,"al observations [18]. For classical SBT-based FeFETs [19], the ferroelectric film is much thicker but can be operated at similar gate voltages due to the low SBT coercive field of approximately 50 kV/cm at 200 nm dFE [20]. However, also for these types of FeFETs, depolarization has always been [9] and remains a challenge as seen by the suploop operation in Figure 6c. Consequently, data retention characteristics could be proven up to a maximum of 30 days for SBT-based FeFETs [23]. In order to give an estimate regarding the reliability characteristics of the presented FeFET approaches (Figure 6a-c), electron tunneling currents during erase operation were calculated based on equations from [24] (see Figure 7). As can be seen from Figure 6a-c, Fowler-Nordheim tunneling applies for NVM FE-HfO2 FeFET cell, whereas for both other FeFET stacks modified Fowler-Nordheim tunneling occurs. Comparing the non-volatile to the volatile FE-HfO2- or to the SBT-FeFET clearly reveals severe differences: The NVM-FeFET suffers from severe charge injection due to the very thin SiO2 interface of 1 nm and an order of magnitude higher electric field. This charge injection can be seen as the most likely cause for accelerated endurance degradation. Since the band bending in Figure 6a shows that charge injection is close to the Fowler-Nordheim regime, increasing the interfacial layer thickness alone is unlikely to improve cycling characteristics (see also [25]). Although charge trapping seems to be detrimental for FeFET endurance, it brings benefit in data retention. The higher amount of trapped charge at higher program/erase amplitudes compensates the polarization charge, which",395
Muller_Miko_FRAM_IWM_2014.docx,results,"in a decreased depolarization field and improves the retention properties (to be published elsewhere). The presence of charge trapping most likely explains the better retention properties of NVM FE-HfO2 FeFET stack [7], for which 10 years data retention is expected even at 200 °C [4], in contrast to both other FeFET types with a retention capability limited to several minutes [18] and days [23]. Therefore, an MFIS-FeFET memory cell exhibits a trade-off between endurance and retention behavior, where charge trapping is playing the key role. A way to improve the endurance characteristics of MFIS-type FeFETs and at the same time preserve good retention properties was presented in [26]: By lowering PS of the ferroelectric, both the interfacial field stress as well as the depolarization field can be reduced. However, since the PS actually represents an intrinsic material property, it remains to be verified if such a low polarization might not detrimentally affect device statistics [27]. Figure 7. Electron tunneling current density and electric field in the interfacial layer EIL versus tunneling barrier thickness for three types of FeFET cells under their typical erase conditions: non-volatile FE-HfO2 FeFET [7], DRAM-type volatile FE-HfO2 FeFET [18] and SBT-FeFET [19]. In order to improve FeFET memory characteristics without engineering the ferroelectric itself, it might be possible to create MFS-type FeFETs in the future, i.e. eliminating the insulator between HfO2 and the silicon bulk altogether (Figure 6d). Significant progress in the field of epitactically grown HfO2 by ALD and appropriate post annealing steps has been made in the past [28]. If such approaches prove viable in the future, electron injection during erase operations might be reduced due to the different band alignment of the FeFET gate stack (Figure 6e). Moreover, in order to improve the retention characteristics of high PS FeFETs, creating an artificial imprint by workfunction engineering can be envisioned (Figure 6f). By this approach, different FeFET types possessing either destructive- or non-destructive-read out ((N)DRO) characteristics can be created. Due to the imprint created by an adjusted metal gate workfunction, a saturated and a fully depolarized state can be stabilized which could improve the overall FeFET retention characteristics. However, from a memory architecture viewpoint also for these types of FeFETs, write disturbs have to be eliminated by e.g. 2T cell concepts. V.",598
Muller_Miko_FRAM_IWM_2014.docx,CONCLUSION,"Hafnium oxide emerges as a CMOS-compatible ferroelectric providing unique three-dimensional and lateral scaling potential to capacitor as well as transistor based FRAM. Due to the large Ec of FE-HfO2 and its stable ferroelectric properties at reduced thickness, scaling of 1T FRAM alongside HKMG and 1T-1C FRAM alongside DRAM appears possible, yielding the potential to establish the first high density ferroelectric memory technology. However, considering the necessity of a large Ec to enable this drastic size reduction an intrinsic dilemma between scaling and device performance of ferroelectric memories evolves. As a consequence, the close to breakdown field operation of FE-HfO2 based MFM capacitors as well as severe charge injection in comparable MFIS-FETs are posing severe endurance constraints on the FE-HfO2 technology in its current development stage. Nevertheless, the possibility to drastically increase endurance at the cost of retention and vice versa as well as to switch between these modes on a system level needs to be considered when assessing this memory technology. Even before further device improvements are established, this flexibility of performance parameters already opens a broad window of potential applications reaching from NOR-FLASH to low refresh rate 1T DRAM.",294

Being different from other high-k dielectrics, where the k value decreases with decreasing film thickness, these films (Hf/Zr ratio = 6:4, 5:5, 3:7) showed increasing k values with decreasing film thicknesses in the ∼5−20 nm range. Among them, Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 and Hf0.3Zr0.7O2 films showed 47 and 43 peak k values at 6.5 and 9.2 nm thicknesses, respectively, suggesting theinvolvement of the MPB phenomenon.

To achieve a sufficient signal margin against the thermal noise andDRAM).1,3Such a decrease in Cs is attributed to the technical difficulty of confirming the high cell capacitance, while the decrease in the bit-line capacitance allowed reliable memory operation with such small Cs. The technical difficulty mainly",308
CSHwang_MPB_FE_HfO2_ACSAMI_2018.docx,results,"from the complexity of the process of sustaining the extremely tall bottom electrodes (BEs) without collapse during the entire process. For the state-of-the-art DRAM technology, Al-doped ZrO2 (AZO) is utilized as a high-k dielectric material within a three-dimensional (3D) cylindrical structure.1,3The high-k capacitor dielectric used to be the ZrO2/Al2O3/ZrO2 (ZAZ) structure at DRAMs with a higher design rule, but the intervening extremely thin Al2O3 layer dissolved into the ZrO2 layer as its thickness became lower than <∼0.5 nm and therefore it is now AZO. Both the top electrode (TE) and BE materials are TiN. Such a structure (TiN/AZO/TiN) has been very successful in providing the required cell capacitance at each technology node because of its structural robustness (TiN is a ceramic material) and the minimized interfacial reaction between the high-k dielectric layer and the electrodes.1,3Asother parasitic circuit capacitance, the cell capacitance (Cs) used to be 25 fF/cell down to the ∼40 nm design rule, but it has decreased to below 10 fF (7−8 fF for 20 nm design-ruleReceived: September 7, 2018Accepted: November 23, 2018Published: November 23, 2018© 2018 American Chemical Society42666DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b15576 ACS Appl.

The most significant problem of these new materials, however, is that they cannot adopt TiN as the electrode mainly because of the interfacial reaction to form the low-k interfacial layer and the insufficient crystallization due to the absence of a lattice match with TiN.1−3Thus, the exotic materials Ru, RuO2, and even SrRuO3 have been adopted as the BE and TE, which is highly unfavorable if these higher-k materials are to be used immediately.1−3On the other hand, the aforementioned electrode materials have a work function higher than TiN, so they can further decrease the leakage current density because the high work function electrode may induce a higher Schottky barrier height at the interface with the HZO film.9,10Another critical problem is the rapidly decreasing k value with the decreasing film thickness, for which reason the scaling of the physical thickness, which is accompanied by a drastic increase in the leakage current, does not necessarily decrease tox as intended.11This higher-k film could not be made sufficiently thin physically (≪10 nm) to be used in such an extremely 3D structure. Therefore, there is still a need to further improve the high-k capacitance performance of the ZrO2-based dielectric film assuming that TiN will still be used down to the design rule of 15 nm or even lower.In this regard, the recently highlighted HfO2−ZrO2 solid solution [(Hf,Zr)O2 or HZO], which was reported to show ferroelectric (FE) or antiferroelectric (AFE) properties in thin-film form, must be promising in terms of further decreasing tox with TiN still used as electrodes.12−20The deposition processes of both materials (HfO2 and ZrO2) are highly matured in the semiconductor fabrication process, where the former is a base material for the high-k gate dielectric layer in the logic transistor and the latter is the capacitor dielectric, as discussed above. Because of its rather large band gap (>5.5 eV), moreover, the leakage current through TiN/HZO/TiN capacitors can be sufficiently low to meet the requirement even for a 5.5 nm thick DRAM capacitor.21Furthermore, with appropriate dopants, the endurance of HZO films can be increased even up to 1011, with a fatigue pulse height of 2.3 MV/cm.22It should be noted that this field (1.15 V for 5 nm thick films) is ∼43% higher than that (∼0.8 V) required for the state-of-the-art DRAM operation, suggesting that the endur-ance can be further improved as DRAM capacitors. On the other hand, Pešić et al. suggested that HfO2-based antiferro-electrics can be utilized for nonvolatile memories by shifting their characteristic double polarization−electric field (P−E) hysteresis curve along the voltage axis.21,22By this approach,42667 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b15576ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch Articlehold time of 1.0 s), and an impedance analyzer (4194A, HP, at the 10 kHz ac bias frequency).

In this schematic diagram, the m-phase corresponds to the cases where the P−V loop shows a Pr value smaller than 3 μC cm−2, and in such cases, the dominant presence of the m-phase can be confirmed through GAXRD.. The FE phase corresponds to the cases where the Pr value was >12 μC cm−2, and the intensities of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks from the m- phase are negligible for such cases.. The FE + m region, therefore, corresponds to the cases where the Pr value was higher than 3 μC cm−2but lower than 12 μC cm−2, and the coexistence of the m- and o-phase can be confirmed from the GAXRD patterns.. The AFE phase showed typical double-hysteretic P−V loops at highly positive and negative biases while the Pr value was ∼0 μC cm−2.. The origin of the AFE-like double hysteresis is known as a field-induced phase transition between the t- and o-phases.16,25,38,39The stable crystalline phase at zero electric field is the t-phase, but the small energy difference between the t- and o-phase can be readily overcome by the sufficiently high electric field.. For the broken loop, which is known as a sign of first-order phase transition, the physical circumstance is different from the aforementioned AFE loop.40,41In this case, the metastable polar phase can remain even at zero electric field, but during polarization Figure 2. k−E curves (left y-axis, symbol and curves) and electrics loss−electric field curves (right y-axis, lines) of the (a) Hf0.3Zr0.7O2, (b) Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, and (c) Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 films with various thicknesses..

The possible use of a lower thickness is in fact even more important than the marginal improvement of the electrical performance for making the extremely 3D-structured DRAM capacitor. If the thickness is not lower than ∼one-third of the design rule, it cannot be physically fit into the 3D capacitor structure no matter how high the k value is.The data shown in Figure 2d could be converted to tox versus tphy plots, as shown in Figure 3a,b, which are more convenient for estimating the performance of the dielectric layer as the DRAM capacitor. Furthermore, the leakage current density (J) estimated at ±0.8 V, which is actually higher than the capacitor voltage for sub 20 nm design-rule DRAMs, can be plotted as a function of tox for different Hf/Zr ratios, as shown in Figure 3c. This is the most critical plot for the evaluation of the DRAM capacitor dielectrics, by which the minimum achievable tox can be determined.42670 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b15576ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch Articlewith different Hf/Zr ratios because of the involvement of the MPB at a lower tphy (6.5 nm), which was accompanied by the highest k value. The slower decrease in tox with the further decrease in tphy to 5.5 nm reflected the decrease in the k value at this thickness. The Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 films had generally higher tox values in this region, which were in accordance with the generally lower k value of this film composition. Therefore, these films showed less promising scaling behavior in this lower thickness region because of their lack of MPB.Figure 3c showed the J−tox performances of the three types of films. The minimum tox (tphy) values, which met the J requirement of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, Hf0.3Zr0.7O2, and Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 films, were 0.70 (7.9), 0.81 (7.7), and 1.09 (9.2) nm, respectively. For the case of the Hf0.3Zr0.7O2 films, the leakage current through the 7.7 nm thick film was also lower than the requirement for DRAM application. Because of the decrease in the k value with the further decreasing tphy, however, a further decrease in film thickness may not increase the capacitance density, as expected from the highest k value. The scaling limit of the Hf0.3Zr0.7O2 films may be similar to that of the ZrO2 capacitors because of the relatively low k value (∼35 at 7.7 nm).Although the minimum tox of 0.71 nm for the case of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film is already promising compared with the currently available minimum tox of ZAZ (∼0.7 nm) considering the uncontrolled laboratory environment, the performance can be further improved by optimizing the PMA condition. Figure 4a,b shows the k−E curves of the 6.5 and 7.9 nm thick Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films under various PMA conditions (temperature and time), and Figure 4c,d shows the corresponding J−E curves. For the case of the 5.5 nm thick film, it was found that the 500 °C/30 s condition was necessary to crystalize it (450°C/2 min could not crystalize it). For the case of the 6.5 nm thick films, the k (tox) value decreased (increased) from 46 (∼0.55 nm) to ∼41 (∼0.62 nm) and 38 (∼0.66 nm) when the PMA condition was changed from 500 °C/30 s to 450 °C/2 min and to 400 °C/10 s. For the case of the 7.9 nm thick films, the k (tox) value decreased (increased) from 44 (∼0.70 nm) to∼41 (∼0.74 nm) and ∼41 (∼0.74 nm) with the same change in the PMA condition. Therefore, the milder PMA condition (lower temperature and/or shorter annealing time) slightly increased the tox values because of the lower crystallization and accompanying decrease in k value. The leakage current was largely decreased by more than 1 order of magnitude, however, as can be seen in Figure 4c,d, from the same change in the PMA condition. Therefore, the J−tox performance can actually be improved by such a change in the PMA condition, and the improved",1291

CSHwang_MPB_FE_HfO2_ACSAMI_2018.docx,experiment,".Theoretically, the high k value at the MPB of single crystals can be understood based on the flattening of the free energy−polarization curve. The k value is inversely proportional to the curvature of the free energy−polarization curve. It should be noted that the polycrystalline HZO films investigated in this study might be different from the single crystals. As guessed from Figure 1, HZO thin films are the mixture of several different crystalline phases. Therefore, even at the MPB conditions, there exist several different crystalline phases, and some of grains or sub grains should be related to the MPB behavior. Another potential factor which can contribute to the high k value of the polycrystalline HZO thin films is the field-42671 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b15576ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch Articlethickness within a thickness range of <∼10 nm. This is accompanied by the MPB between the two phases, which showed the peak dielectric constant. Because of the involvement of such a peculiar effect in this HfO2−ZrO2 solid solution system, which is mainly due to the competition between the bulk and surface free-energy effects, the k value showed a peak value as high as ∼50 within a 6−10 nm thickness range depending on the Hf/Zr ratio. This is in stark contrast to other high-k dielectric films, whose k value usually decays with decreasing thickness because of the presence of an interfacial low-k layer, and is detrimental to many electronic applications. These findings are in agreement with the theoretical model of phase evolution based on the recent first-principles calculation",377

Hwang_MPB_HZO_ACS_2018.docx,ABSTRACT,": The utilization of the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between the newly found ferroelectric orthorhombic phase and the tetragonal phase in an HfO2−ZrO2 solid solution is suggested for a high-capacitance dielectric capacitor. Being different from other high-k dielectrics, where the k value decreases with decreasing film thickness, these films (Hf/Zr ratio = 6:4, 5:5, 3:7) showed increasing k values with decreasing film thicknesses in the ∼5−20 nm range. Among them, Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 and Hf0.3Zr0.7O2 films showed 47 and 43 peak k values at 6.5 and 9.2 nm thicknesses, respectively, suggesting theinvolvement of the MPB phenomenon. For the systematic understanding of this peculiar phenomenon, the phase evolution of the HfO2−ZrO2 solid solution is presented based on",212

The detailed electrical tests of the films with differentcompositions and thicknesses demonstrated that the characteristic feature of this materialsystem is consistent with the involvement of the MPB depending on the composition andthickness. Through the optimization of the annealing process for crystallization, a 0.62 nm minimum equivalent oxide thickness was reported for the 6.5 nm thick Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film, which is highly promising for the future dynamic random access memories. This work provided a breakthrough method for overcoming the fundamental limitation of a decreasing k value with a decreasing film thickness of other high-k dielectrics.",147
Hwang_MPB_HZO_ACS_2018.docx,INTRODUCTION,"With ever-increasing data to be stored and processed, the memory technology has undergone significant advancement in the past several decades.1−3Dynamic random access memory(DRAM) has been the main memory in computers for sometime now and will likely keep this role in the future as there arecurrently no emerging memories that seem to hold the promise of replacing it.1−3No memory device other than DRAM has been confirmed to simultaneously have high density (>several tens of gigabit), high speed (∼20 ns), unlimited endurance (>1016cycles), and a low fabrication cost.1−3The performanceand productivity of spin-transfer torque RAM were enormously improved in the past several years (switching time ≈ 10 ns, endurance ≈ 1016), but its still large cell area (>10F2, where F means the minimum feature size; the DRAM cell size is 6F2) inhibits its adoption as the main memory.4DRAM is composed of one transistor and one capacitor (1T−1C), where 1T plays the role of the memory cell selectorand 1C stores the charge, which represents the digital data. To achieve a sufficient signal margin against the thermal noise andDRAM).1,3Such a decrease in Cs is attributed to the technical difficulty of confirming the high cell capacitance, while the decrease in the bit-line capacitance allowed reliable memory operation with such small Cs. The technical difficulty mainly",308
Hwang_MPB_HZO_ACS_2018.docx,results,"from the complexity of the process of sustaining the extremely tall bottom electrodes (BEs) without collapse during the entire process. For the state-of-the-art DRAM technology, Al-doped ZrO2 (AZO) is utilized as a high-k dielectric material within a three-dimensional (3D) cylindrical structure.1,3The high-k capacitor dielectric used to be the ZrO2/Al2O3/ZrO2 (ZAZ) structure at DRAMs with a higher design rule, but the intervening extremely thin Al2O3 layer dissolved into the ZrO2 layer as its thickness became lower than <∼0.5 nm and therefore it is now AZO. Both the top electrode (TE) and BE materials are TiN. Such a structure (TiN/AZO/TiN) has been very successful in providing the required cell capacitance at each technology node because of its structural robustness (TiN is a ceramic material) and the minimized interfacial reaction between the high-k dielectric layer and the electrodes.1,3Asother parasitic circuit capacitance, the cell capacitance (Cs) used to be 25 fF/cell down to the ∼40 nm design rule, but it has decreased to below 10 fF (7−8 fF for 20 nm design-ruleReceived: September 7, 2018Accepted: November 23, 2018Published: November 23, 2018© 2018 American Chemical Society42666DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b15576 ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2018, 10, 42666−42673ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch ArticleAZO has a much higher oxidation potential than TiN, the interfacial TiOx layer formation can be minimized even when a highly reactive oxygen source, such as O3, is pulsed during the AZO film growth through atomic layer deposition (ALD).1,3 The achievable minimum equivalent oxide thickness (tox = tphy× (3.9/k) + tox i , where tphy is the physical thickness and tox corresponds to the additional tox from any interfacial layer) from this structure appears to be limited to ∼0.6−0.7 nm.1,3 An even smaller tox, however, will soon be necessary for further scaled DRAMs.To cope with such a requirement, higher-k dielectrics, such as rutile-structured TiO2 (k ≈ 100−140), Al-doped TiO2 (k ≈60−100), and SrTiO3 (k ≈ 150−200) have been actively researched on.1−3,5−8The abovementioned reports have shown that a minimum achievable tox with a stable leakage current [<10−7A cm−2at the capacitor operation voltage (∼half of the device voltage)] can be as small as 0.35−0.4 nm, which appears to be highly promising. The most significant problem of these new materials, however, is that they cannot adopt TiN as the electrode mainly because of the interfacial reaction to form the low-k interfacial layer and the insufficient crystallization due to the absence of a lattice match with TiN.1−3Thus, the exotic materials Ru, RuO2, and even SrRuO3 have been adopted as the BE and TE, which is highly unfavorable if these higher-k materials are to be used immediately.1−3On the other hand, the aforementioned electrode materials have a work function higher than TiN, so they can further decrease the leakage current density because the high work function electrode may induce a higher Schottky barrier height at the interface with the HZO film.9,10Another critical problem is the rapidly decreasing k value with the decreasing film thickness, for which reason the scaling of the physical thickness, which is accompanied by a drastic increase in the leakage current, does not necessarily decrease tox as intended.11This higher-k film could not be made sufficiently thin physically (≪10 nm) to be used in such an extremely 3D structure. Therefore, there is still a need to further improve the high-k capacitance performance of the ZrO2-based dielectric film assuming that TiN will still be used down to the design rule of 15 nm or even lower.In this regard, the recently highlighted HfO2−ZrO2 solid solution [(Hf,Zr)O2 or HZO], which was reported to show ferroelectric (FE) or antiferroelectric (AFE) properties in thin-film form, must be promising in terms of further decreasing tox with TiN still used as electrodes.12−20The deposition processes of both materials (HfO2 and ZrO2) are highly matured in the semiconductor fabrication process, where the former is a base material for the high-k gate dielectric layer in the logic transistor and the latter is the capacitor dielectric, as discussed above. Because of its rather large band gap (>5.5 eV), moreover, the leakage current through TiN/HZO/TiN capacitors can be sufficiently low to meet the requirement even for a 5.5 nm thick DRAM capacitor.21Furthermore, with appropriate dopants, the endurance of HZO films can be increased even up to 1011, with a fatigue pulse height of 2.3 MV/cm.22It should be noted that this field (1.15 V for 5 nm thick films) is ∼43% higher than that (∼0.8 V) required for the state-of-the-art DRAM operation, suggesting that the endur-ance can be further improved as DRAM capacitors. On the other hand, Pešić et al. suggested that HfO2-based antiferro-electrics can be utilized for nonvolatile memories by shifting their characteristic double polarization−electric field (P−E) hysteresis curve along the voltage axis.21,22By this approach,42667 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b15576ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch Articlehold time of 1.0 s), and an impedance analyzer (4194A, HP, at the 10 kHz ac bias frequency).

In this schematic diagram, the m-phase corresponds to the cases where the P−V loop shows a Pr value smaller than 3 μC cm−2, and in such cases, the dominant presence of the m-phase can be confirmed through GAXRD.. The FE phase corresponds to the cases where the Pr value was >12 μC cm−2, and the intensities of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks from the m- phase are negligible for such cases.. The FE + m region, therefore, corresponds to the cases where the Pr value was higher than 3 μC cm−2but lower than 12 μC cm−2, and the coexistence of the m- and o-phase can be confirmed from the GAXRD patterns.. The AFE phase showed typical double-hysteretic P−V loops at highly positive and negative biases while the Pr value was ∼0 μC cm−2.. The origin of the AFE-like double hysteresis is known as a field-induced phase transition between the t- and o-phases.16,25,38,39The stable crystalline phase at zero electric field is the t-phase, but the small energy difference between the t- and o-phase can be readily overcome by the sufficiently high electric field.. For the broken loop, which is known as a sign of first-order phase transition, the physical circumstance is different from the aforementioned AFE loop.40,41In this case, the metastable polar phase can remain even at zero electric field, but during polarization Figure 2. k−E curves (left y-axis, symbol and curves) and electrics loss−electric field curves (right y-axis, lines) of the (a) Hf0.3Zr0.7O2, (b) Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, and (c) Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 films with various thicknesses..

The possible use of a lower thickness is in fact even more important than the marginal improvement of the electrical performance for making the extremely 3D-structured DRAM capacitor. If the thickness is not lower than ∼one-third of the design rule, it cannot be physically fit into the 3D capacitor structure no matter how high the k value is.The data shown in Figure 2d could be converted to tox versus tphy plots, as shown in Figure 3a,b, which are more convenient for estimating the performance of the dielectric layer as the DRAM capacitor. Furthermore, the leakage current density (J) estimated at ±0.8 V, which is actually higher than the capacitor voltage for sub 20 nm design-rule DRAMs, can be plotted as a function of tox for different Hf/Zr ratios, as shown in Figure 3c. This is the most critical plot for the evaluation of the DRAM capacitor dielectrics, by which the minimum achievable tox can be determined.42670 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b15576ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch Articlewith different Hf/Zr ratios because of the involvement of the MPB at a lower tphy (6.5 nm), which was accompanied by the highest k value. The slower decrease in tox with the further decrease in tphy to 5.5 nm reflected the decrease in the k value at this thickness. The Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 films had generally higher tox values in this region, which were in accordance with the generally lower k value of this film composition. Therefore, these films showed less promising scaling behavior in this lower thickness region because of their lack of MPB.Figure 3c showed the J−tox performances of the three types of films. The minimum tox (tphy) values, which met the J requirement of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, Hf0.3Zr0.7O2, and Hf0.6Zr0.4O2 films, were 0.70 (7.9), 0.81 (7.7), and 1.09 (9.2) nm, respectively. For the case of the Hf0.3Zr0.7O2 films, the leakage current through the 7.7 nm thick film was also lower than the requirement for DRAM application. Because of the decrease in the k value with the further decreasing tphy, however, a further decrease in film thickness may not increase the capacitance density, as expected from the highest k value. The scaling limit of the Hf0.3Zr0.7O2 films may be similar to that of the ZrO2 capacitors because of the relatively low k value (∼35 at 7.7 nm).Although the minimum tox of 0.71 nm for the case of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film is already promising compared with the currently available minimum tox of ZAZ (∼0.7 nm) considering the uncontrolled laboratory environment, the performance can be further improved by optimizing the PMA condition. Figure 4a,b shows the k−E curves of the 6.5 and 7.9 nm thick Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films under various PMA conditions (temperature and time), and Figure 4c,d shows the corresponding J−E curves. For the case of the 5.5 nm thick film, it was found that the 500 °C/30 s condition was necessary to crystalize it (450°C/2 min could not crystalize it). For the case of the 6.5 nm thick films, the k (tox) value decreased (increased) from 46 (∼0.55 nm) to ∼41 (∼0.62 nm) and 38 (∼0.66 nm) when the PMA condition was changed from 500 °C/30 s to 450 °C/2 min and to 400 °C/10 s. For the case of the 7.9 nm thick films, the k (tox) value decreased (increased) from 44 (∼0.70 nm) to∼41 (∼0.74 nm) and ∼41 (∼0.74 nm) with the same change in the PMA condition. Therefore, the milder PMA condition (lower temperature and/or shorter annealing time) slightly increased the tox values because of the lower crystallization and accompanying decrease in k value. The leakage current was largely decreased by more than 1 order of magnitude, however, as can be seen in Figure 4c,d, from the same change in the PMA condition. Therefore, the J−tox performance can actually be improved by such a change in the PMA condition, and the improved",1291

Hwang_MPB_HZO_ACS_2018.docx,experiment,".Theoretically, the high k value at the MPB of single crystals can be understood based on the flattening of the free energy−polarization curve. The k value is inversely proportional to the curvature of the free energy−polarization curve. It should be noted that the polycrystalline HZO films investigated in this study might be different from the single crystals. As guessed from Figure 1, HZO thin films are the mixture of several different crystalline phases. Therefore, even at the MPB conditions, there exist several different crystalline phases, and some of grains or sub grains should be related to the MPB behavior. Another potential factor which can contribute to the high k value of the polycrystalline HZO thin films is the field-42671 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b15576ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch Articlethickness within a thickness range of <∼10 nm. This is accompanied by the MPB between the two phases, which showed the peak dielectric constant. Because of the involvement of such a peculiar effect in this HfO2−ZrO2 solid solution system, which is mainly due to the competition between the bulk and surface free-energy effects, the k value showed a peak value as high as ∼50 within a 6−10 nm thickness range depending on the Hf/Zr ratio. This is in stark contrast to other high-k dielectric films, whose k value usually decays with decreasing thickness because of the presence of an interfacial low-k layer, and is detrimental to many electronic applications. These findings are in agreement with the theoretical model of phase evolution based on the recent first-principles calculation",377

All capacitors up to 30k trenches capacitor to capacitor device. With this test structure it is possible to investigate the relation between the increase of polarization and the increase of capacitor area. The area gain factor compared to the planar projected area depends on the number of trench holes, the diameter of a single trench and the determined depth of the trenches which was extracted from the STEM analysis. As basis for the area calculation of the regularly rectangular shaped trench holes an elliptic model was used. It is needed to take the rounded corners of the holes into account. Even if this approach is the most conservative it was applied to avoid an overestimation of the trench area. The measured planar capacitor served as reference value for the measured polarization of the trench arrays. In Fig. 2 a) the polarization for different trench arrays with respect to the projected planar area as well as the calculated area gain factor for the measured devices is illustrated. In contrast to this, Fig. 2 b) illustrates the area normalized polarization hysteresis for the different trench arrays and compares them to the planar area hysteresis loop. Further it summarizes the loss of remanent polarization with increasing number of trenches. For the planar capacitor, without trenches, a remanent polarization of 15 µC/cm2 was measured. The trench array with 100k trenches has a calculated area gain factor of 11.12 and the measured remanent polarization based on the projected planar area of this array is 152 µC/cm2 (Fig. 3). This translates to an actual remanent polarization of 13.6 µC/cm2. This remanent polarization value of the 100k array suggests that all parts, including the trench side walls, contribute to the overall polarization gain.

Suman_Akif_SL_FEFET_IEDM_2021.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in image analysis and pattern recognition with extreme accuracy.. Training these networks to perform these tasks involves constantly updating the values of high-dimensional synaptic weight matrices.. As the weights are usually stored in off-chip DRAM, the energy consumption and training time of the network rapidly increases with the complexity of the input data set, with data transfers dictating most of the execution time and consumed energy.. Therefore, the energy efficiency and training time of DNNs can be substantially improved by storing weights on-chip in a compute-in-memory configuration.. The device requirements of an on-chip analog weight cell consist of a wide dynamic range of conductance states with a symmetric, linear update profile during potentiation and depression.. Such characteristics impact the learning accuracy of a network.. Previous work has demonstrated a 5-bit analog weight cell implemented with a compact silicon FET with a ferroelectric gate stack of CMOS-compatible Zr-doped HfO2 (HZO) [5].. It is possible to increase the number of conductance states through domain engineering of the ferroelectric gate stack.. By inserting a dielectric layer within the ferroelectric HZO, the domain density within the gate stack increases not only to accommodate more polarization and, hence, conductance states, but also to enhance the symmetry and linearity of the resulting profile.. While the related 2T1F embedded memory cell also has high linearity[8], its large area footprint hampers its retention time, when compared to a compact 1T design utilizing an engineered ferroelectric film.. II.DOMAIN ENGINEERING THROUGH SUPERLATTICE FEDESIGN In a ferroelectric (FE) film, the total free energy of the system is the sum of its electrostatic energy and domain wall energy.. This dictates the number of domains that exist in its equilibrium state.. As the depolarization field increases with an applied voltage, the FE film tends to decompose into a higher number of domains to minimize the overall free energy of the system.. This opens up an opportunity for domain-engineering in the FE film to stabilize a large number of domains, and hence more polarization states, through the modulation of the depolarization screening field.. To explore this notion, we fabricate structures consisting of FE/DE/FE superlattices with 5nm HZO FE films, and a DE (HfO2) spacer of variable thickness.. Fig.. 2(a) shows that the energy minima of the system, calculated using [9], moves towards a configuration with higher domain density as we increase the DE thickness until it saturates around 5nm (Fig..",563

Electron.Mater.2020, 19012441901244 (3 of 7)© 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheimwww.advelectronicmat.deeffects in ferroelectric devices, a pulsed programing and erasing of the device was used to explore the shift of the I–V curve instead of sweeping up to high voltages in both direc-tions. This was done to avoid detrimental effects caused by the slow ramping during the DC I–V curves.[26] The measurements were performed using the terminals sketched in Figure 2a. The top-gate stack covered both the intrinsic Si channel and the metal-semiconductor (NiSi2-Si) Schottky junctions (SJs) and was connected to a pulse measurement unit (PMU). The latter was employed for both recording the transfer character-istics and applying the program (PRG)/erase (ERS) pulses. The source terminal was fixed at ground potential, while the drain terminal was connected to a second PMU. During pulses both source and drain terminals were grounded.Schottky-type SiNW devices based on intrinsic Si are ambi-polar.[27] However, the n-current is comparably small if no optimization is performed[28,29] and falling below the detection limits of the PMU setup. This is the reason why the transfer characteristics of Figure 2c only show p-type currents for the chosen VTG range.The effect of PRG and ERS pulses was evaluated with the simple pulse sequence sketched in Figure 2b. Pulse amplitudes VP=+9 V and VN=−9 V were employed for PRG and ERS, respectively. The pulse duration in both cases was Δ= 4 ms. For reproducibility, the sequence was repeated five times. In Figure 2c, the drain current ID recorded in the programmed (after PRG pulse) and erased (after ERS pulse) state are plotted versus top gate voltage VTG.The transfer curves for the programmed and erased state appear shifted with respect to each other, with a memory window MW≈1 V. In particular, the shift is in the positive (negative) voltage direction for the transfer curve recorded after the ERS (PRG) pulse. This is coherent to what has been reported for p-type FeFETs in ref. [30] and in general is expected for FeFETs. In contrast to charge trapping that shifts the transfer curve always in the direction of voltage pulse, for ferroelectric gate oxide the transfer curve shifts always to the opposite direction.[26,31] We propose a qualitative interpreta-tion based on the band diagrams sketched in Figure 2e, for the transistor in the on-state. A voltage pulse generates a polarization PFE within the ferroelectric HZO layer due to alignment of the internal dipoles, which remains after the pulse. This polarization directly above the Si channel acts as an additional electric field EFE. A PRG pulse (positive)",687
NW_FEFET_AEM_2020.docx,results,"in an additional positive EFE, i.e., for a p-type FET the device at zero applied external voltage is more “off” compared to the case without PFE. As a consequence, similar to what is reported for MOSFET-type FeFETs, the transfer characteristics after a PRG pulse is shifted toward more negative voltages by EFE. The behavior reverses for the ERS pulse, i.e., EFE is nega-tive and therefore the FET appears more “on” at zero applied external voltage.An additional effect of EFE which is not observed in MOSFET-type FeFETs is evidenced in the linear plot of Figure 2d, where the average ID is plotted versus overdrive voltage. The latter is calculated as the difference between the applied voltage and the threshold voltage V*TH. Here, V*TH is defined as the VTG at which ID=I*TH= 10−8 A. When comparing the transfer characteristics after PRG and ERS pulses in Figure 2d, a slightly different IDfor the same overdrive is found. In particular, an almost con-stant relative current variation between ERS and PRG states ΔID ON= (IDERS−ID PR)/ID ERS≈30% is observed in the overdrive range below ≈−1.2 V, approximately corresponding to the tran-sistor on-state. This is not the case for MOSFET-type p-FeFET[30] and n-FeFET[9] devices, where the transfer characteristics after PRG and ERS pulses are only “horizontally” shifted. This effect may be attributed to the particular carrier injection mechanism in Schottky-barrier FETs (SB-FETs) that involves thermal emis-sion but also tunneling, with the latter being dominant in the transistor’s ON state.[28] The band-bending due to EFE described above in the specific case also modifies the SB width at the source and drain contacts. In particular, the SB width for hole injection (i.e., into the valence band Ev) is enlarged by a posi-tive EFE (programmed state, Figure 2e, left) and reduced by a negative EFE (erased state, Figure 2e, right). Consequently, the junction transmissibility via tunneling is reduced or enhanced, respectively. As for SB-FETs the tunneling current is the domi-nant contribution to the on-current, the latter is very sensitive to modifications of the potential landscape around the SJs. In ON of ≈30% could be due to spatial particular, the reported ΔID inhomogeneity of EFE, i.e., stronger EFE in proximity of the SJs, resulting in a sizeable modification of the tunneling barrier. A spatial inhomogeneity of EFE could have electrostatic reasons, in connection to the intrinsic character of the SiNW channel. This interpretation is coherent to what has been reported in ref. [22], where a strong on-current difference between PRG and ERS states was achieved by a remanent EFE localized at one single SJ (at the source contact). Note that when an SB-FET is used, the additional modulation of the SB width increases the memory window compared to the one that can be observed in a classical MOSFET. Therefore, SB-FETS can be beneficial to realize FeFET memory cells.We have further characterized the SiNW-FeFET by varying the pulse intensity (VP and VN), duration (Δt), and wait time (WT) between pulse and read, according to the sequences in Figure 3a,b. The",792
NW_FEFET_AEM_2020.docx,results,"are displayed in Figure 3c,e for the PRG pulse, and in Figure 3d,f for the ERS pulse. In order to preset the devices always to the same reference state, the PRG (ERS) pulse sequence was preceded by a PRG-ERS (ERS-PRG) reset series, as in Figure 3a,b. For both PRG and ERS pulses, voltage pulse amplitudes above 6 V are required to achieve a detectable shift of the transfer characteristics. These large values result from a relatively thick SiO2 layer in the gate-stack. In fact, due to its significantly lower dielectric con-stant and to a comparable physical thickness with respect to the ferroelectric layer, the resulting capacitive voltage divider in the gate-stack is such that a large portion of the gate voltage drops over the SiO2 layer. Nevertheless, to increase the switching efficiency, it is desirable to increase the voltage drop over the HZO layer. This can be achieved by reducing the SiO2 thickness and/or increasing the HZO thickness. In fact, as recently demonstrated for planar FeFETs with 20 nm thick HfO2, this not only enhances the switching efficiency but also increases the memory window and the resilience against parasitic charge trapping.[32] Charge trapping is in fact known to affect HfO2-based ferroelectric devices[26] and we expect it to influence also the memory window in our SiNW-FeFET device.Adv.

Here, the extracted V*TH values at I*TH= 10−8 A are plotted versus VP (VN), for several Δt values. The gradual increase is compatible to the channel length of 1 µm, encompassing the presence of a large number of ferroelectric domains.[15] Moreover, due to the under-etching, the thickness of the HZO is slightly inhomogenous as seen in the TEM cross-section of Figure 1h, resulting in local variations of the switching voltage.The effect of Δt within the investigated range is less pro-nounced compared to what is expected in FeFETs.[15] For long times and small voltages, an opposite shift in threshold voltage is seen, which can be explained by parasitic charge trapping effects in the gate stack.In Figure4, we evaluated the retention of the programmed/ erased states by recording MW as a function of the wait time WT between pulse and read. The memory window drops down composing the gate-stack employed here, leading to strong depolarization fields which negatively affect the retention.[30,33] The depolarization arises from a nonperfect screening of the polarization charges leading to a residual electric field which counteracts the ferroelectric polarization.[33] Furthermore, com-pared to an MOS device with ferroelectric gate, the cross-sec-tion of the channel region of SiNWs has multiple Si/SiO2 ori-entations leading, e.g., to locally different interface trap charge (Qit) and possibly oxide fixed charge (Qf) density levels within the same device.[34–36] These",964

The HZO films were deposited by 100 supercycles of alternating TEMAHf and TEMAZr-based processes with a cycle ratio of 1:1. The deposition temperature was 250 °C.The metal-gate stack for the SiNW FeFETs was fabricated by e-beam lithography, deposition of Ti/Pt (10 nm/20 nm) by an e-beam evaporator, and lift-off. The sample was then immersed in HF with concentration 2.5%, for 7 min in order to form openings through the HZO for the source and drain contacts. The different HF etching rate for the metals composing the gate stack (low for Pt, high for Ti[40]) resulted in a selective under-etching of the Ti layer and thinning of the HZO layer underneath. The element-specific TEM in Figure 1i confirmed that no substantial Ti was present in the gate stack. From local energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of the HZO layer, the atomic ratio of Hf to Zr was found to be 38:62 (see the Supporting Information). The discrepancy with the expected 50:50 ratio could be Figure4. Memory window MW versus wait time WT, the time interval between pulse and measurement. MW is evaluated from the transfer characteristics in the programmed and erased state (Figure 3e,f) as the difference in threshold voltage ΔV*TH found after VP= 3 V and VP= 9 V (programmed), and VN=−3 V and VN=−9 V state (erased).ferroelectric Hf0.38Zr0.62O2 layer was integrated via a gate-first approach in the top gate stack of a silicon nanowire transistor fabricated by top-down technology. Two distinct transistor states (programmed and erased) were observed in correspond-ence to negative and positive polarization in the ferroelec-tric layer, with a memory window of ≈1.5 V. As the top gate also covers the SJs between intrinsic Si and NiSi2 segments, associated with the ferroelectric polarization, also a non-volatile modulation of the SJ transmissibility was observed, with a relative current variation ΔID ON∼ 30%. Consequently, the memory window is increased in the SiNW Schottky-FET compared to a conventional FeFET because of the additional effect of the modulation of the tunneling barrier transmis-sibility of charge carriers. The reported proof of principle of a attributed to a slightly higher etching rate of diluted HF for HfO2 with respect to ZrO2.[41] The polarization versus voltage curves of metal-insulator-metal structures fabricated using the same ALD process as for the SiNW FeFETs are reported in the Supporting Information, for the as-deposited (25 nm) as well as for a 5 nm thick HZO film.

Mechanical confi nement, [4] doping, [5] defects, [6] stoichiometry variations, [7] or exchange of (oxygen) isotopes [8] have been shown to induce ferroelectricity for previously para-electric materials. [9] Hence, the originally paraelectric phase, which is assumed to be stabilized by quantum fl uctuations, [10] transforms to a ferroelectric phase.

From an applica-tion point of view, these fi ndings are of signifi cant importance since they eliminate the perception that it is only possible to induce ferroelectricity in uncapped HfO 2 by using rare-earth dopants like yttrium.

The layout of the shadow mask was such as to deposit platinum dot sizes of 110, 200, 280, and 450 μ m in diameter. The platinum dots were also used as a hard mask for wet chemical etching of the TiN top electrode down to the Al:HfO 2 layer.

An almost ideal linear relationship between molar percentage of aluminium in HfO 2 and cycle ratio could be achieved, which indicates a very controlled depo-sition process ( Figure1 a). A TiN top electrode of approximately 20 nm thickness was deposited on top of the hafnium oxide again using pulsed CVD (450 ° C). After top electrode formation, samples were exposed to rapid thermal annealing (RTA) for either 20 s at 800 ° C or for 1 s at 1000 ° C in a nitrogen environ-ment.

The root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of the PMA samples is signifi cantly smaller than for the PDA samples. Hence, the vertical grain growth during annealing is homogenized by depositing a TiN cap between platinum contact and the doped hafnium oxide. Moreover, an increased surface roughness was also refl ected by the leakage current and break-down characteristics of the capacitors, i.e., the PDA process led to increased leakage currents and smaller breakdown voltages.

Mueller_Incipient_FE_Al_HfO2_AFM_2012.docx,Conclusion,"s Thin fi lms of aluminium-doped HfO 2 of 16 nm thickness were investigated. Electrical characterization showed the incipient antiferroelectric and ferroelectric nature of the material system due to the incorporation of aluminium into the host lattice. Electrical permittivities reached maximum values of around 35 for samples in which antiferroelectricity had been provoked. GI-XRD analysis indicated that the necessary non-centrosym-metry of the elementary cell can most likely be assigned to an orthorhombic Pbc2 1 phase located in the vicinity of the transi-tion from purely monoclinic HfO 2 to the cubic lattice of highly doped HfO 2 . The recently discovered ferroelectric properties of this mate-rial system are advantageous not only because of the extensive industrial expertise regarding HfO 2 -based dielectrics but also because of the CMOS-integratability of both hafnium oxide and aluminium. The authors anticipate that HfO 2 ferroelec-tric thin fi lms of only 16 nm thickness might be of interest to various research and industry communities, especially because its properties are highly tunable (through the doping concen-tration, annealing conditions, and mechanical confi nement). Applications like ferroelectric random access memories, piezo-electric applications or ferroelectric fi eld effect transistors [27–30] might be envisioned. Furthermore, the fact that all ferroelectric materials show pyroelectric as well as piezoelectric properties [31] extends the area of potential applications. The ferroelectricity of HfO 2 might also help in advancing novel electronic devices, like negative capacitance fi eld-effect transistors. [32,33] Moreover, the fact that ferroelectricity can be provoked at annealing tem-peratures of up to 1000 ° C demonstrates the viability for a wide range of applications. 4.",413

Furthermore, a Göbel mirror and a 0.2 mm slit were used on the primary side and a Soller mount on the detector side. For acquisition of the diffractograms, an integration time of 35 s per step and an angular resolution of 0.05 ° were chosen for the 10 ° to 90 ° interval of 2 θ.

Protons with energy of 3 MeV are adopted as the radiation source in this research. 2×1.7 MV tandem electrostatic accelerator of Peking University is used to provide the proton beam. Devices are in open circuit state during radiation, and the angle between the proton beam and sample surface normal is about 7°. The proton fluence are 5e13, 1e14, 5e14 and 1e15 ions/cm2, and the corresponding exposure time are 20min, 40min, 200min, 400min, respectively. The crystal structure of the HYO films is analyzed by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, XRD-7000, SHIMADZU).

wang2018.docx,DISCUSSION,"In HfO2-based ferroelectric device, the orthorhombic phase Pbc21 of HfO2 is believed as the origin of the ferroelectricity [6]–[10]. To investigate the proton effects on the orthorhombic phase, XRD of the same HYO film sample are tested three times: the pristine, 1e14 and 1e15 states (radiated after proton beam with the fluence of 1e14 and 1e15 ions/cm2).As shown in Fig. 1(a), the (111)o diffraction peaks from the orthorhombic phase is observed at 30.27°. The peak positions and half peak widths are not significantly altered, and no diffraction peaks from other phases emerge. The very similar XRD patterns indicate no obvious phase change induced by proton radiation. The permittivity of the pris-tine, 1e14 and 1e15 states are also investigated and shown in Fig. 1(b). The εr–E curves do not display any distor-tion or asymmetry, which is much robust than PZT based devices against the proton radiation [4]. Only slight variations are shown after proton radiation. For three states, the permit-tivity at 0 MV/cm are 40.6, 40.5 and 39.7, respectively. A very small decrement of permittivity about −2.2 % is observed after the 1e15 ions/cm2proton fluence.To investigate the polarization of capacitor, a triangular electrical pulse is enforced on the capacitor, with the elec-tric field loop 0→2.5→0→−2.5→0 MV/cm. Electric field and current of the capacitors are monitored meanwhile, and recorded in Fig. 1(c). Hysteresis loops are drawn based on the current curves, and shown in Fig. 1(d). The asymmetry of the positive and negative coercive fields may be attributed to the different fabrication process of the top and bottom electrodes. There is no distortion shown in all hysteresis loops under different proton fluence. Up to fluence of 1e15 ions/cm2, the polarization value remains almost the same as the pristine state. The positive coercive fields of the three states are 1.04, 1.09 and 1.17 MV/cm. The negative coercive fields are −0.62,−0.59, and −0.56 MV/cm respectively. A slight “imprint”Fig. 2.

The inset is the PUND mode wave used to test 2Pr values.effect is shown, which is similar to the coercive field shift after gamma ray radiation in our previous report [11]. Proton radiation will induce electron-hole pairs, oxygen vacancies and subsequent charge trapping [15], [16], leading to built-in field and ferroelectric domain pinning [10], [14]. The built-in field change the voltage imposed on ferroelectric domains, causing voltage shift. Comparing the permittivity and ferroelectric hysteresis variations after radiation, the perfor-mance of HYO devices is more stable than other ferroelectric memory [4], [14].To further investigate the proton radiation effects on the memory storage window, the remanent polarization values of 5 groups (35 devices for each group) are tested under the electric field of 1.3 MV/cm after different proton fluence. 2Pr values are tested using the positive-up-negative-down (PUND) mode, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b). The PUND is consisted of four trapezoidal waves with the time of 2200 ns. The rising time, keeping time, falling time are all 150 ns, and delaying time is 100 ns. The statistical box charts of 2Pr values are summarized in Fig. 2(a). 2Pr values distribution is represented by the shape of the box chart, and the percentile is shown in the inset. As the proton fluence increases from pristine to 1e15 ions/cm2, 2Pr values decrease from 13.4 to 9.4 μC/cm2gradually. The phenomenon is related to the fer-roelectric domain pinning induced by proton radiation, which decrease the reversible domain [10], [14]. More ferroelectric domain pinning are formed with increasing the proton fluence, resulting in a further reduction in the 2Pr values, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The difference of 2Pr before and after radiation is lower under high electric fields, as shown in Fig. 2(b). After proton radiation with the fluence of 1e15 ions/cm2, the 2Pr values decrease by 34%, 25% and 20%, for the electric field of 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 MV/cm respectively. But under the electric field of 2.5 MV/cm, which is the field used in Fig. 1, the variation is only 6%. Therefore, although the memory window is decreased by proton radiation, the influence is little under the electrical field of 2.5 MV/cm, which is commonly used in read/write cycles.The endurance of HYO ferroelectric memory devices has been investigated in our previous reports [9], [11], where cycling endurance over 4e7 cycles is achieved. The deteriora-tion induced by cycling is more obvious under lower electricalWANG et al.: PROTON RADIATION EFFECTS ON Y-DOPED HfO2-BASED FERROELECTRIC MEMORY 825TABLE I COMPARISON OF THE PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS BEFORE AND AFTER PROTON RADIATIONis related to the oxygen vacancies diffusion induced by cycling. Based on the reference [10], the oxygen vacancies diffusion probably cause the phase transformation from non-ferroelectric to ferroelectric in the HfO2-based capacitors, which increases the volume fraction taking part in polarization switching process. The effect suppresses the 2Pr degrada-tion. Combining the decreased initial 2Pr induced by proton radiation, the condition of 1e14 ions/cm2shows the largest remanent polarization after 4e7 cycles. To clearly understand the mechanism of the suppressed fatigue, further research is needed in future.The electrical characterization",1468

One group is pristine, and other 4 groups are radiated by protons with fluence of 5e13, 1e14, 5e14 and 1e15 ions/cm2, respectively. Then all the devices are cycled up to 4e7 times with the electrical field of 1.3 MV/cm. The measure wave for endurance is inserted in Fig. 3(a), one cycle time is 1100 ns (rising time, keeping time, falling time are all 150 ns, and delaying time is 100 ns). After 4e7 cycles, remanent polarizations are tested using the PUND mode and shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The overall changes are shown for the whole group. Statistical box charts of the remanent polarization after cycling are summarized in Fig. 3(c). For the pristine devices, 80 % reduction of the 2Pr is observed after 4e7 cycles due to fatigue. Cycling induced defects and subsequent domain pinning decrease reversible domain, leading to 2Pr decrease [9]. Interestingly, this fatigue process is suppressed in radiated devices. For proton flu-ence of 1e14 ions/cm2, the minimum fatigue and the largest remanent polarization is reached, with 45% reduction of 2Pr after 4e7 cycles, much lower than the pristine devices.

Lederere_FEFET_TKD_NanoMaterials_2020.docx,Abstract,": The microstructure of ferroelectric hafnium oxide plays a vital role for its application, e.g., non-volatile memories. In this study, transmission Kikuchi diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy STEM techniques are used to compare the crystallographic phase and orientation of Si and Zr doped HfO2 thin films as well as integrated in a 22 nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET). Both HfO2 films showed a predominately orthorhombic phase in accordance with electrical measurements and X-ray diffraction XRD data. Furthermore, a stronger texture is found for the microstructure of the Si doped HfO2 (HSO) thin film, which is attributed to stress conditions inside the film stack during crystallization. For the HSO thin film fabricated in a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) like structure, a different microstructure, with no apparent texture as well as a different fraction of orthorhombic phase is observed. The 22 nm FDSOI FeFET showed an orthorhombic phase for the HSO layer, as well as an out-of-plane texture of the [111]-axis, which is preferable for the application as non-volatile memory.",282
Lederere_FEFET_TKD_NanoMaterials_2020.docx,Introduction,"Due to the high coercive field, compatibility with conventional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processes and persistent ferroelectricity for ultra thin layers [1,2], HfO2 shows excellent properties for non-volatile memories such as ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFET) [3], ferroelectric random-access memories (FeRAM) [4], and ferroelectric tunneling junctions (FTJs) [5].Ferroelectric properties in HfO2, which have been reported to originate from the orthorhombic phase of the space group Pca21 [6], have already been demonstrated in polycrystalline films doped with various elements such as Y, Sr, Al, Si, or Zr [5] as well as in undoped films [7]. Furthermore, epitaxially grown films of ferroelectric HfO2 have been recently reported [8,9].Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 384; doi:10.3390/nano10020384www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterialsNanomaterials 2020, 10, 384 2 of 11Since the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase of HfO2 is only a metastable phase [10], polycrystalline films can contain a multitude of phases. Here, the monoclinic phase of space group P21/c, which is the ground state of bulk HfO2, as well as the tetragonal phase (P42/nmc) and the cubic phase (Fm3m) are suggested by density functional theory based calculations to be most likely present [10]. The phase composition as well as associated textures of the film can be influenced by stress [10], doping [5], thermal treatment [11], and film thickness [12]. It should be mentioned here that, except the phase of space group Pca21, two other orthorhombic phases, which are of space group Pbca and Pnma respectively, have been reported for HfO2 [10]. As the stabilization of these phases requires high pressure and since both phases do not exhibit ferroelectricity, they are not discussed further in this article.For the application in highly scaled non-volatile memories, such as in 28 nm and 22 nm technology node high-k metal gate (HKMG) CMOS processes where FeFETs using ferroelectric HfO2 thin films have already been demonstrated [13,14], the local orientation and crystallographic phase of the HfO2 grains and the overall microstructure of the thin film are of vital importance.In this article, we investigate Si:HfO2 (HSO) and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) films utilizing transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD), which allows for analyzing the microstructure as well as the local crystallographic phase and orientation of the HfO2 film [15], X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrical characterization. Furthermore, we use scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques for mapping the local crystallographic phase and orientation in a HSO based FeFET fabricated in 22 nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) [14] technology.2. Materials and MethodsThe samples with a metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) structure were prepared by firstly depositing a 10 nm thick TiN bottom electrode on a highly p-doped silicon wafer using atomic layer deposition (ALD). For the HSO layer, HfCl4 and SiCl4 precursors were deposited in a 20:1 ratio with an ALD process, resulting in a silicon content of approximately 3.6 atm%. Similarly, the ZrCl4 precursor was used in a 1:1 ratio for the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 deposition. The thickness of the layer was in both cases 10 nm. After ALD of the respective ferroelectric layer, physical vapor deposition (PVD) was used for a TiN top electrode, also called capping layer, and a rapid thermal spike annealing process at 800◦C was performed.Capacitors required for electrical measurements were structured by deposition of metal (Ti/Pt) contacts utilizing a shadow mask and a subsequent SC1 wet etch, to remove the conductive capping layer. Polarization–Voltage (P–V) loops were measured with a peak amplitude of 3 V at 1 kHz using an aixACCT TF Analyzer 3000 measurement setup. For the cycling of the material, the same conditions were applied.For the structural investigation of the MFM samples, grazing incidence XRD (GIXRD) and TKD were conducted. Former uses a Bruker D8 Discover XRD system, collecting patterns in a 2θ range of 10◦to 70◦at a fixed incident angle of 0.5◦. For TKD analysis, the samples were dimpled and the measurements were performed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) utilizing a Bruker Optimus TKD detector. The applied acceleration voltage was 30 kV. It should be noted here that a thin TiN layer is present on top of the HfO2 layer. As the measurement is performed in transmission, this will result in weak artefacts and/or increased noise level in the detector image [15,16].For the structural analysis of highly scaled embedded non-volatile memory (eNVM) devices, FeFETs were integrated into a 22 nm FDSOI platform using a non-invasive eNVM process [14]. Slightly larger HZO and HSO based FeFETs, which are used for analysis of material influences on the device properties, were prepared in an HKMG CMOS process replacing the dielectric HfO2 with HSO or HZO. Furthermore, a SiON interface is used instead of the native oxide.The maximum memory window (MW), which is defined for a given current, describes the maximum of threshold voltage shift possible for a given device. This shift",1316

The threshold voltage of each state was extracted at a current of 10 nA from the transfer characteristics of the transistor.Structural investigation of the cross-section and in-plane section, which was prepared without structuring, were performed using a STEM and a two-dimensional (2D) detector. This allows for measuring the complete diffraction pattern, which is essential for the analysis of crystallographic phase and orientation.3.",160
Lederere_FEFET_TKD_NanoMaterials_2020.docx,Results,"The electrical measurements of the MFM samples show for both HSO and HZO that an initially pinched P–V loop (see Figure 1a) and thus a anti-ferroelectric-like behavior. With cycling, the loops become more ferroelectric, as can be seen from the resulting merged peaks in the corresponding current–voltage (I–V) loops. This behavior is called wake-up effect.After wake-up, both samples show a increased remanent polarization (Pr), but the HSO layer (2Pr = 40.68 µC/cm2) has a 20% lower 2Pr than the HZO layer (2Pr = 51.03 µC/cm2), while, in case of HZO, the peaks in the corresponding current-voltage (I–V) loops merged to a symmetric peak, HSO shows a very sharp peak in addition to a rather small broad peak. Analogously, the P–V loop appears more square-like. This indicates a pronounced texture or even a favored presence of certain orientation of the polarization axis in the film, since a sharp peak resembles a very small coercive field distribution. The coercive field (2Ec) extracted from the P–V loops or HSO and HZO is 2.17 V and 1.59 V, respectively. Differences can be explained by texture, which is likely to be present as indicated by the I–V loops.(a) (b)Figure 1. Electrical measurements (a) and grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns (b) of the Si- and Zr-doped HfO2 (HSO/HZO) metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) sample. (a) Polarization–voltage (P–V) as well as the corresponding current–voltage (I–V) loops before and after cycling. Both samples exhibit a pronounced wake-up effect. GIXRD patterns (b) show a larger monoclinic phase fraction in case of HSO. Furthermore, differences in the intensity ratio of specific peaks (e.g., (100) and (110)) of the same phase indicate a strongly pronounced texture inside the HSO film.The measured diffraction patterns of both samples are presented in Figure 1b. HSO as well as HZO show a predominant orthorhombic, tetragonal, or cubic phase. Since all of them show very similar diffraction lines, they are not distinguishable. Furthermore, both samples seem to contain small amounts of the monoclinic phase, as seen by the two diffraction lines close to 30◦with intensities near the noise level. Additionally, the HSO sample shows a clear diffraction line at around 17◦, which can originate from the orthorhombic as well as monoclinic phase. Since this line corresponds to theNanomaterials 2020, 10, 384 4 of 11[100]-axis and should show much lower intensity than the lines at around 30◦, it suggests the presence of strongly pronounced texture or even a preferred crystallographic orientation of the monoclinic and/or orthorhombic grains. This is further supported by the increased intensity of the lines around 35◦, which correspond to the <200>-axes. In addition, in the case of HZO, the lines around 35◦appear to have an increased intensity, suggesting a texture for this material as well.While TKD measurements were performed on both MFM samples, the following",767
Lederere_FEFET_TKD_NanoMaterials_2020.docx,results,"are focused on the HSO sample.. The HZO sample has been analyzed in the same manner.. By visualizing the intensity of the scatter signal for all measured Kikuchi patterns, a so-called quality image can be constructed (see Figure 2a).. This visualization allows for already identifying grains and their degree of symmetry, as high symmetric phases appear bright, whereas dark areas resemble low symmetric phases or amorphous regions like grain boundaries.. Figure 2.. Transmission Kikuchi diffraction analysis of HSO and HZO layers.. (a) shows the quality map extracted from the scatter signal of HSO film.. The measured Kikuchi patterns (here shown for HZO) are fitted with given phases, shown for orthorhombic phase in (b) and the reliability of the fit can be estimated from the number of indexed lines, which is visualized in (c) for HSO.. The assigned phases can be shown in so-called phase maps, shown in (d) and (e) for HSO and HZO, respectively.. The extracted equivalent diameter of the grains is displayed in the form of cumulative distributions (f).. For given crystal structures, in this case the orthorhombic and monoclinic phase of HfO2, the expected Kikuchi patterns can be simulated and fitted to the measured ones (see Figure 2b).. From the amount of indexed lines, the trust in each fit can be estimated and visualized (see Figure 2c).. By color coding the fitted phases, the crystallographic phase distribution of the microstructure can be visualized as shown for HSO and HZO in Figure 2d,e, respectively.. It should be noted here that the tetragonal and cubic phases were not taken into account, since their Kikuchi patterns are quite similar, thus rendering a fit to distinguish these phases much more difficult.. Therefore, some tetragonal or cubic grains will be indexed as orthorhombic in the fit.. Figure 2d identifies grains that appeared quite dark in the quality map (Figure 2a) as monoclinic, which appears darker due to its lower symmetry.. Since the scatter signal is much weaker for these grains, large amounts of the grain could not be indexed.. Nevertheless, it can be seen in Figure 2c that, for points indexed as monoclinic, many lines could still be fitted.. Furthermore, the sum of data points for each grain allowed a clear assignment to one of the given phases..",512
Lederere_FEFET_TKD_NanoMaterials_2020.docx,Discussion,"When comparing the HSO and HZO films (Figure 2d,e), the HSO layer seems to contain a higher fraction of monoclinic grains.. By indexing the individual grains, the fraction of grains assigned to the monoclinic phase reaches 32.4% in case of HSO, whereas it is 3.8% for the HZO layer.. This is further supported by the P–V loops, which showed a strongly decreased remanent polarization for HSO.. Due to the large area of the measured capacitors, the measured polarization resembles an average value of all included grains.. Differences in the exact fraction for TKD and P–V loops can be explained by differences in texture of the two layers and TKD representing a fraction of the grains, whereas P–V loops represent a fraction of the area.. Additionally, GIXRD also agrees with these findings, as the monoclinic lines show a higher intensity.. The observed differences in the two materials could have various origins.. One possible explanation is the dopant distribution inside the material.. Zr, which is very similar to Hf regarding its chemical behavior and ionic radius (rZr = 0.84 Å, rHf = 0.83 Å) [18], shows a stabilization of the ferroelectric phase in HfO2 over a broad concentration distribution with a maximum at around 50 atm% [2].. Si, on the other hand, has a much smaller ionic radius (rSi = 0.4 Å) than Hf [18] and already small concentrations around 3 atm% are enough to stabilize the orthorhombic phase [1].. Therefore, small fluctuations of the silicon content inside the layer may result in different phases.. Since the present Si concentration in the sample are slightly lower than the optimal concentration, monoclinic grains are expected.. Another explanation is the larger grain size in the HSO film that can be seen in Figure 2f, which displays the cumulative distribution of the equivalent grain diameter for HZO and HSO.. While the average equivalent diameter of the orthorhombic grains in the HZO film is 28.5 nm, it is 33.9 nm in the case of the HSO film..",467
Lederere_FEFET_TKD_NanoMaterials_2020.docx,discussion,"of the structural analysis of the highly scaled FeFET, the planar view (see Figure 5) is considered first. The monoclinic fraction appears to be lower compared to the HSO MFM sample. This is explainable by the different stack structure of the two samples. The sample analyzed by TKD was a metal-ferroelectric-metal structure, whereas the STEM sample is a metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MFIS) structure. Therefore, the HfO2 is crystallizing on top of a TiN electrode or SiO2 interface layer, respectively. This has strong influences on the strain conditions inside the stack, as well as it being able to affect the deposition process and the nucleation.Additionally, the pronounced texture as for the MFM sample cannot be detected, thus indicating that the stress conditions in this stack are different and probably lower in case of the MFIS sample. Therefore, it demonstrates that MFM stacks do not suffice for material development of HfO2 for the application in integrated FeFETs or rather the necessity for further research regarding the material behavior in MFIS stacks.Finally, the large area crystallographic phase and orientation analysis of an integrated HfO2 based FeFET using STEM techniques has been demonstrated. The cross-section of the 22 nm FDSOI FeFETNanomaterials 2020, 10, 384 10 of 11showed an orthorhombic HfO2 layer with an [111] orientation along the gate stack.

With the use of high-k dielectrics as insu-lating buffer (e.g., HfO2 based) and ferroelectrics with a rather low dielectric constant (e.g., SBT or polymer ferroelectrics), low voltage operation and low depolarization fields are within reach and are no longer keeping the device from becoming the ultimate memory device it was thought to be [3]–[5]. However, in addition to these promising",428
Thomas_HfO2_ns_Switching_FET_EDL_2012.docx,results,", the temperature stability of organic ferroelectrics in a standard CMOS flow remains questionable, and the commonly used perovskite-based ferroelectrics such as SBT and PZT [6] require special inte-gration schemes due to the sensitivity of the materials toward hydrogen [7] and the large physical height of the gate stack. Additionally, their composing elements as well as the required noble metal electrodes may pose contamination risks to con-ventional CMOS and are therefore rarely qualified in large-scale IC manufacturing. Recently, however, it has been shown that crystallization of Si : HfO2 in the presence of a mechanical confinement, e.g., titanium nitride metal gate (TiN-MG), leads to a noncentrosymmetric orthorhombic phase, which, in turn, produces a spontaneous polarization [8]. Ferroelectricity in HfO2, a material that, so far, was only considered as insulating buffer layer in MFIS-FETs [3]–[6], now offers the opportunity to form highly scaled ferroelectric FET and capacitor devices. Great benefit can be drawn from the efforts that have already been made in the field of conventional high-k/metal gate and DRAM storage capacitor integration using HfO2-based HKs and TiN-MG.In this letter, we report on the polarization switching kinetics of Si : HfO2-based MFM capacitors and superimposed charge injection phenomena in the related MFIS structure. Tran-sient pulsing schemes were applied to deduce conditions for optimized memory operation. Retention measurements were conducted to validate memory functionality for short pulse program and erase.II.",358

However, absolute switching times are largely dominated by the RC delay of the measurement setup.(Fig. 1), whereas the SiO2 content in HfO2 was tuned by the 4DMAS/TEMAH cycle ratio and confirmed by XPS to be around 5 mol%. The TiN-MG for the MFM structure as well as for the MFIS gate stack was formed in a CVD process from TiCl4 and NH3. The CVD process temperature was adjusted below the crystallization temperature of the Si : HfO2 thin film, while crystallization was induced in a downstream postmet-allization anneal at 650◦C. For the transfer of the 10-nm ferroelectric layer to an MFIS-type gate stack, a slightly higher Si content was chosen to account for the activation anneal at 1000◦C during transistor fabrication. This measure was found to be necessary to obtain equally behaved ferroelectrics at dif-ferent thermal budgets and is possibly caused by Si segregation.III.",582
Thomas_HfO2_ns_Switching_FET_EDL_2012.docx,DISCUSSION,"Polarization hysteresis measurements of an MFM capacitor are shown in the inset of Fig. 2. When the applied voltage is swept sufficiently high, in this case above ±3 V accounting for three times the coercive field Ec of 1 MV/cm, fully saturated hysteresis loops can be recorded. Remanent polarization Pr for this saturated polarization loop is estimated to be 11 μC/cm2, whereas for smaller bias sweeps, a typical subloop behavior of incomplete polarization reversal is observed. Similar to commonly known ferroelectrics, this minor hysteresis loops lead to a drop of Pr and a slightly lower Ec. Those subloops are of great importance in MFIS-FETs since they are preferably accessed to avoid high interfacial fields and switching voltages. To gain further insight into the switching kinetics of the ferroelectric Si : HfO2 thin films, a modified positive up neg-Fig. 3.

As expected from ferroelectric polarization switching, a counterclockwise threshold voltage hysteresis is ob-served. (b) Transient program/erase matrix (10 ns–1 ms, 2–6.6 V) reveals an MW evolution depending on ferroelectric switching kinetics and superimposed charge injection at high field and pulsewidth.ative down (PUND) [9] methodology was applied (Fig. 2). Following a +3-V initialization pulse, a variable negative pulse was applied to the MFM capacitor. The charge switched by the variable pulse was then evaluated by the comparison of two consecutive +3-V sensing pulses, recording the polarization reversal and the linear contribution of the capacitor. A steep increase in Pr and an early saturation can be observed for voltages well above Ec, whereas for pulses slightly above or even at Ec, only slow polarization reversal occurs. Different from the subloop behavior observed at a fixed frequency and voltage ramp rate, this pulsed characterization shows that, given time, a saturated polarization level even at low fields can still be achieved. The general trend to faster switching speeds with increasing voltage is frequently observed in ferroelectrics and shows that polarization reversal is a statistical process strongly accelerated when exceeding certain activation fields [10]. For the FeFET, this leaves the opportunity of fast program/erase at high electric field and slow program/erase at low electric field. When integrating the ferroelectric transistor into a memory matrix, this behavior defines the possible array architectures.Erase at positive gate bias, defined as lowering the nFET threshold voltage, and program at negative gate bias, turning off the transistor by increasing the threshold voltage, were similar like for the MFM structure realized by a single burst from a pulse generator connected to the gate. Fig. 3(a) shows the char-acteristic response of a ferroelectric Si : HfO2-based transistor to a 100-ns ±6-V program/erase pulse. The counterclockwise hysteresis, as opposed to the clockwise hysteresis observed for charge trapping devices, clearly shows the ferroelectric switching behavior of the transistor.A transient program and erase pulse train, schematically shown in Fig. 3, was applied to investigate the switching time and voltage behavior of the device. The resulting MW matrix reaching from 2 to 6.5 V for 10 ns–1 ms pulsewidth is shown in Fig. 3(b).

Thomas_HfO2_ns_Switching_FET_EDL_2012.docx,CONCLUSION,"In summary, a completely CMOS-compatible MFIS-FET has been fabricated by implementing ferroelectric Si : HfO2 thin films in conjunction with a TiN-MG. A characteristic field and time dependence of ferroelectric polarization reversal was ob-served for MFM capacitors as well as for the MFIS gate stacks. Limited only by the measurement setup, switching speeds down to 20 ns were observed, opening up an MW of about 1.2 V. However, for a high program voltage and pulsewidth, charge injection was found to limit the influence of the ferroelectric polarization onto the threshold voltage shift. Additionally, a stable MW was demonstrated after 17 days. A simple linear extrapolation of retention data predicts a residual MW of 620 mV after ten years.",159

Subsequent postdeposition annealing should yield the desired perovskite phase at moderate sintering temperature, which limits the possibility of intermixing the cations to short length scales. Therefore, the combination of the ALD sequences for the binary oxides should result in a reproducible sequence of nano-laminate layers. From the chemisorption-controlled character of ALD it becomes clear that in the ALD growth of a multicomponent material, the depo-sition rate of a certain metal oxide depends on the growth conditions and surface properties of the previously deposited metal oxide layer, and thus on the sequence6FeRAM161Table 6.2 Summary of the precursor combinations tested for the ALD PZT process comprising the structure and thermal properties of the single precursors and findings for the multicomponent ALD processesSystem 1System 2System 3Lead Source StructureDecomposition ALD of PbOTitanium Source StructureDecomposition ALD of TiO2Zirconium Source StructureDecomposition ALD of ZrO2ALD of PZT Zr/(Zr ?

hoffmann-eifert2013.docx,results,"for the three systems can be summarized as follows: System 1.. Pb(TMHD)2 was chosen from the standard precursors for lead(II).. Zr(TMHD)4 is a standard oxygen-containing precursor used in LI-MOCVD-type processes [59].. In order to have good compatibility of 162 S. Hoffmann-Eifert and T. Watanabe the transition metal sources, Ti(Oi–Pr)2(TMHD)2 was chosen for the Ti source.. Although ALD processes were established for all three binary oxides, the combination of the ALD processes into a nano-laminate process for PZT at about 240 �C suffered from two drawbacks.. First, the metal sources displayed a strong interdepen-dence of the deposition rates of the cations in the deposited amorphous layer.. This further resulted in a variation of the cation composition when a Pb–Zr–Ti–O-containing film was grown into a 3D pinhole structure (see Fig.. 6.9a).. In addition, the films were lead-deficient and the Zr content could not be raised much above 10 at % [46].. System 2.. The interdependence of the deposition rates among the three sources was primarily attributed to a possible cross reaction between the lead and the titanium source, because the Zr content of the grown layers was below 10 %.. Thus, a titanium source was sought which is more compatible with the standard lead source Pb(TMHD)2 with respect to its thermal properties.. The replacement of the stabilized titanium source by the pure alkoxide Ti(Oi–Pr)4, while maintaining Pb(TMHD)2 and Zr(TMHD)4 as the respective cation precursors, significantly improved the stability of the ALD process by reducing correlation effects in the growth of the binary oxide layers.. The lead content in the films was slightly below the stoichiometric composi-tion.. Amorphous Pb–Zr–Ti–O-containing films deposited into 3D hole structures revealed good conformity and constant stoichiometry even for hole diameters of 0.18 lm (see Fig.. 6.9b)..",520
hoffmann-eifert2013.docx,discussion,"on the possible role of the PbOx nanocrystallites in the crystallization process of the ALD PZT films was beyond the scope of this case study and would be too speculative. It must therefore be postponed for future investigations together with a crystalliza-tion study of the ALD PZT thin films in 3D device-type structures.Within the scope of a case study, ALD-type processes for the multi-component FE oxide Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 based on a combination of binary oxide processes uti-lizing different alkoxide and b-diketonate-type precursors were successfully demonstrated. Additionally, conformality and compositional homogeneity were demonstrated for films grown into capacitor pinhole structures of 0.18 lm in diameter.6.5 Trends in Ferroelectric Field Effect TransistorsFeFET utilizes a thin FE oxide layer to replace the gate oxide. This enables the source-drain current to be controlled by varying the polarization state in the FE oxide. Hence, the FeFET represents a nonvolatile FE memory device with highest integration density, which enables a nondestructive read-out of the stored infor-mation, i.e., the orientation of the polarization [62]. Recently, research on FeFET devices experienced renewed interest after the successful integration of high-k oxides, such as HfO2, as gate dielectrics. One of the key factors for this evolution is the availability of ALD processes enabling the deposition of an oxide layer without a severe degradation of the transistor channel properties. A modified ALD PZT process was recently reported for the fabrication of integrated metal-FE-insulator-semiconductor diodes [63]. Another exciting trend was the discovery of ferroelectricity in silicon-doped HfO2 and ZrO2 thin films. A closer investigation revealed that the doping stabilizes an orthorhombic state of the binary oxide which is FE [64]. Especially, the proven compatibility of these oxides makes them attractive for integration into FeFETs, which is reflected by increased activities in this field [65].",454

Although the role of dopants is still not well understood, the ferroelectric phase is considered to originate from the structural stabilization of the non-centrosymmetric phase of HfO2, owing to cation doping.. It is like dopant-induced martensitic phase transition of ZrO2 studied extensively by fine ceramics community, in which two possible reasons have been conjectured.14)One is charge balance and the other one is ionic radius.. The ferroelectricity enhancement reported in HfO2 is always accompanied by the structural phase transition.. According to first-principles calculations, the free energies of two orthorhombic (O) polar phases (Pca21 and Pmn21) are relatively low and very close to those of nonpolar equilibrium phases [e.g., P21=c monoclinic (M) phase at a low temper-ature].15)The orthorhombic phase has a higher symmetry than the monoclinic one, but it has a lower coordination number of Hf (7) than that in a tetragonal (T, P42=nmc) or cubic (C, Fm�3m) case (8).. From the viewpoint of the HfO2 phase transition, the metastable orthorhombic polar phase might exist at the boundary between the monoclinic and tetragonal phases.16)Therefore, the ferroelectric phase forma-tion and related ferroelectric properties should be signifi-cantly affected by phase transition processes..",379

This is the case for Sc or Y doping. However, in the N-doped HfO2 case, a marked para-=ferroelectric transition is observed as a strong effect from the direction N bonds.Fig. 3.

Figure 4(a) shows the switchable polariza-tion PSW for N-, Sc-, and Y-doped HfO2 as a function of doping concentration. As expected, the Sc- and Y-doped HfO2 exhibit quite similar behaviors. With the coordination number 8, ionic Sr3+has an 87 pm radius, which is very close to that of Hf4+(83 pm), while the radius of ionic Y3+is 102 pm.25)This suggests that the Sc- or Y-doping-induced HfO2 para-=ferroelectric transition is dominated by the Vo mechanism, whereas the ionic radius effect is not dominated. For the N-doped HfO2, slight doping can enhance the ferro-electricity, but overdoping can eliminate the ferroelectricity. This tendency is similar to Sc and Y doping cases. How-ever, note that 0.34% N is sufficient to maximize the ferroelectricity, and 2.44% N can totally suppress PSW below 2 µC=cm2, whereas 0.7 and over 4% are needed for Sc doping and Y doping cases, respectively.In addition, the XRD patterns of N-doped HfO2 are different from those of Sc-doped HfO2 [shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)].

From the Vo viewpoint, rH can be increased and finally becomes 100% as the stabilized tetragonal or cubic phases by introducing enough oxygen vacancies. This can explain the Sc- or Y-doping-induced HfO2 phase transition behaviors very well, but it is not suitable in the N doping case. We attribute the unique N-doping behaviors to N bond effects.Here, since Vo is the key ingredient for structural phase transition and the present doping systems can be regarded as diluted doping, we assume that the key parameter in the N-doped case is still the oxygen vacancy motion. Therefore, we discuss the",274

In the N doping case, aVo increases with CVo more sharply than that in the cation doping case at a small doping stage. On the other hand, γVo in N-doped HfO2 sharply decreases when CVo is over 1% owing to stronger N bond effects, while it is not the case in Sc- or Y-doped HfO2, in which the Vo activity is simply equal to the Vo density. For the ferroelectricity enhancement region, Vo can cause the phase transition from the monoclinic phase to higher symmetric phases, and then generates metastable polar phases at the boundary of M and T phases. Therefore, slight Sc, Y, and N dopings are all effective in enhancing the HfO2 ferroelectricity. Here, N-doped HfO2 exhibits a marked phase transition in a small doping region, which should be related to N bond effects. In the ferroelectricity suppression region, it is understandable that the overdoping of Sc and Y can eliminate the ferroelectricity as the stabilization of the T or C091501-3©2016 The Japan Society of Applied PhysicsAppl.

As shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), the monoclinic phase has totally transformed to highly symmetric phases when the doping concentration is over 1.5%, and accordingly, the ferroelectricity of Sc- or Y-doped HfO2 is suppressed in this doping region. However, in the N-doped HfO2 case, although we can observe the coexistence of the M and highly symmetric phases, the ferroelectricity is more markedly suppressed than that in the cation doping case. This indicates that a large number of N bonds, especially N–O bonds, might be responsible for suppressing atomic motions, and thus contribute to a marked suppression of HfO2 ferroelectricity.In this study, the electrical and structural phase properties of N-doped HfO2 have been investigated. A small amount of N doping drives the ferroelectricity of HfO2, and the para-= ferroelectric transition in HfO2 is more sensitive to N doping than to Sc or Y doping. The oxygen vacancy formation due to the replacement of O2−by N3−may explain the para-= ferroelectric transition origin in N-doped HfO2. Moreover, note that directional N bonds (Hf–N and N–O) have strong effects on the oxygen vacancy activity, which is different from that of the trivalent cation doping case. N bonds initially help increase the Vo activity and then weaken it in HfO2. N doping has two directly opposite effects, namely, to trigger the ferroelectricity and suppress it.",691

Restrictions apply. the increasing computation depth and with increasing accuracy of the employed algorithm. Algorithm 1 is the most accurate and Algorithm 3 is the least accurate but consumes the least amount of power. The increase in computation energy of 1.8 mJ employing the low-power Algorithm 3 for Design 3 versus Design 1 is not offset by a decrease in trans-mission energy, although the amount of data that needs to be transmitted is decreased 500× in Design 3, as can be seen in Figure 5d. This figure depicts the transmission energy per frame for the three designs, two algorithms, two channel path-loss conditions, and two BERs. The data show that in the case of a low path-loss channel (40 dB), the transmission energy per frame is independent of the computation depth, the type of algorithm used, and the desired BER. This is probably the result of the relatively high standby power of the chosen SDR. The picture is very different in the case of a high path-loss chan-nel (70 dB) which corresponds to real-life use cases: The transmission energy per frame dramatically increases from 3.3 mJ in the case of transmitting the fully processed data to 52 mJ (i.e., a 15× increase) when the 500× larger data are transmitted with a low BER (10−8) over this poor channel. Even when a high BER (10−4) and a low-accuracy algorithm are accept-able, in a high path-loss channel (70 dB), the 1.8-mJ increase in computation energy per frame is more than offset by a larger (7.7 mJ = 9.4 mJ − 1.7 mJ) increase in transmission energy per frame.Analysis of data in [25], as shown in Figure 5, emphasizes that the communication should not be viewed by itself, but rather as a part of a complete sys-tem, that is, combined with the computing. Ideas for improving communication need to evolve from a sole emphasis on low-power radios, duty cycling, and the concept of smart-wake radios to implementing the for-ward-looking concept of intelligent communication. Context-aware and channel-adaptive communication [3], [25], [26] is important and its implementation leads to making communication intelligent. Smart computing combined with intelligent communica-tion will take us closer to the concept of IoT device autonomy required for EI. For example, we may want to capture the sensed data, perform computing on that data to reduce it to information and sequentially at a later time when the quality of the communication channel is good transmit the information.This quantitative analysis example (based on data from [25]) explores the design space and shows that optimization possibilities exist and pursuing a strategy of converting the data to information locally makes sense from a total energy consumption at the edge node point of view. The energy savings can be further improved by accumulating the processed informa-tion locally and transmitting only when the channel quality is good. Especially, in light of the observation that, in the case of a low path-loss channel, there is only a very weak relationship between the amount of data transmitted and the energy required to do this. Therefore, by employing this burst-mode trans-mission approach, there will be a total energy ben-efit in the case of full data processing at the point of collection even when a low path-loss channel is continually available. Something that is unlikely in the real world, that is, a 70-dB high path-loss channel is more representative of real-world condition. Note that burst-mode transmission will require a significant amount of (embedded) NVM with ultralow write and read energy per bit. This will be explored in the “Inter-mittent computing: The Need for Ultra-Low Energy eNVM” section. Note that the data in [25] are for a nonoptimized prototype system. As a result, the abso-lute values of the energies in this prototype system are relatively large because the hardware components were not optimized for this application. The Ga Tech system prototype [25] is capable of low rate of image processing which is useful in low fps applications. The larger computing capability and better energy efficiency needed for higher fps applications that will be required in the future will be addressed later in this article. In",981

System energy optimization for a given application will depend on the technologies available for computing and communication (transmission). Conceptually, this is the path to technology-enabled algorithmic energy-efficient computing and con-text-aware communication [3], [25], [26].Next, we will review some of the recent develop-ments in making communication and computing more energy efficient. In the area of communication, key elements include the need for continual pro-gress in the fields of low-power radios, improved per-formance of radio duty-cycling to lower the energy in joule/bit, as well as the implementation of burst-mode communication (i.e., reduce data, aggregate, and communicate).

Hence, this contributes to making the vision of a trillion connected devices a reality.Researchers in the DARPA NZERO Program [27] have shown wake-up radios that require only nano-watt (nW) power to turn on another more capable radio in the system. However, operating the actual radio in the system frequently can cost an excessive amount of energy. Even the BLE radio consumes tens of milliwatts (consuming power for waking up and shutting down). Recently, startup compa-nies are trying to lower the BLE energy to single digit milliwatts [28], which is an improvement, but more communication energy reduction is needed. Forward-looking intelligent intermittent communica-tion with smart computing for smart IoT devices at the edge close to the data should be a critical topic for research. This links intelligent communication to the topic of intermittent computing and embedded NVM in this article. The end goal is to reduce the data to information at the point of data collection utilizing energy-efficient computing and combine extremely low-power wake-up radios with ultra-low-power infrequent burst transmission. The tradi-tional metric of energy for a radio is pJ/bit, but a new metric of pJ/information (energy per quantum of information that these smart radios will be inter-mittently transmitting) should drive the research. Some of these critical data used in our",535

Communication energy efficiency as a function of transmission distance. Energy-efficient radios (based on the metric of pJ/bit) are a critical part of the communication picture [26]. energy-efficient computing [3], [25]. In fact, this area has been one of the major beneficiaries of Moore’s law-driven improvements (and Dennard’s scaling in years past). Using advanced technology nodes that operate at lower voltages continues to result in greater computing capabilities with improved performance and lower dynamic power consumption. The higher leakage power of these advanced technology nodes poses a challenge, which has led to the development of new leakage power management techniques [16], [17], [29]. The specific application will determine which process technology node is most suitable [30].For example, Intel described an IoT device built on their advanced 14-nm technology node for a vision system used in agriculture applications [17], which relies on duty cycling with keen attention to power management techniques toward energy Figure 7.

hang-tinglue2002.docx,Abstract,"—A numerical analysis of the electrical characteristics for the ferroelectric memory field-effect transistors (FeMFETs) is presented. Two important structures such as the metal–ferroelec-tric–insulator–semiconductor field–effect transistor (MFISFET) and metal–ferroelectric–metal–insulator–semiconductor field–ef-fect transistor (MFMISFET) are considered. A new analytic expression for the relation of polarization versus electric field (P–E) is proposed to describe the nonsaturated hysteresis loop of the ferroelectric material. In order to provide a more accurate simulation, we incorporate the combined effects of the nonsat-urated polarization of ferroelectric layers and the nonuniform distributions of electric field and charge along the channel. We also discuss the possible nonideal effects due to the fixed charges, charge injection, and short channel.

In their model, the drain current calculated by using Brews charge sheet model [10] is not suitable for an FET oper-ated in the saturation (after pinchoff) and subthreshold regions. The model simply assumes the electric field in the ferroelectric film to be constant, independent of the channel position [2], [3]. This assumption is only valid for the case of low drain voltage. In this paper, we shall remove these limitations and propose a more relevant model to include not only the nonsaturated po-larizations of the ferroelectric layer but the nonuniform distri-bution of the field and charge along the channel position. Sys-tematic analyses on the electrical characteristics for MFISFET and MFMISFET in addition to the associated capacitors will be made. The material and geometric parameters of these devices used are in a wide range in order to gain some physical insight about the operation of FeMFETs. The calculation algorithm will also be described in detail so that one can easily follow. We have used 12 parameters to describe the transistor (as listed in Table I), which are the required minimum physical parameters and no other phenomenological ones are needed. The",511

The EOT of the insulator is set to be 4 nm and the ferroelectric is chosen to have a moderate polar-ization in order to obtain a suitable memory window at the low operation voltages.Fig. 4. Memory window as a function of applied bias of MFIS capacitor for (a) various P with a constant ratio of P =P = 5=6 and (b) various "" . The other parameters are the same as Table I.In Fig. 3, we plot the–memory window for an MFIS capacitor. The window is opened wider as the bias voltage is increased, reaching a saturated value for a larger applied bias as displayed in the inset of Fig. 3. The memory window width is defined as the flat-band voltage shift of the two aligned di-rections of the polarizations. At flat-band condition, and then both and the polarization of ferroelectric film are equal to zero according to (11) and(12). Thus the flat-band gate voltage is simply the voltage in ferroelectric, . The max-imum memory window at large bias can be calculated by , where is the electric field with zero polarization. Accord-ingly, the maximum memory window under large applied bias can then be derived as(20)Equation (20) agrees with the maximum value obtained in the inset of Fig. 3.Although it is common to recognize that the hysteresis di-rection for–curve should follow the direction in Fig. 3, its physical reason however is rarely given thus far. We now give ), an explanation on it. If one applies a writing voltage ( then the electric field generated in the ferroelectric and the in-sulator should be negative-valued according to the sign conven-tion in Fig. 2. The polarization will then follow the lower branch based on the description in Section II. At the flat-band con-dition, the polarization is zero and the corresponding electric field is positive-valued. Hence the flat-band gate voltage is pos-itive. Similarly, the flat-band gate voltage is negative for a pos-itive writing voltage ( ). Consequently, the hysteresis loop will trace the clockwise direction as demonstrated in Fig. 3. Likewise, the hysteresis loop will trace counterclockwise direc-tion for an-type substrate.Shown in Figs. 4–6 are the memory windows as a function of bias voltage at various material parameters for an MFIS ca-pacitor.

Fig. 5(b) shows the memory window versus bias voltage at various values of . The memory window is enhanced with increasing for a fixed . Several literatures [5] have stated that a small polarization ( C cm ) is sufficient to obtain the memory window. We think that this assumption is incorrect because a small value of would result in the linear-like P–E curve, leading the ferro-electric to behave closely to the paraelectric phase. The memory window for C cm is very small, as indicated in Fig. 5(b). Therefore, increasing the ratio , or equivalently obtaining a square-like hysteresis loop, is essential for obtaining a large memory window.Fig. 6 illustrates the effects of coercive field and thickness of ferroelectric layer on the memory window. Larger values in and generally increase the memory windows at the same writing voltage but the writing voltage should be increased to obtain the saturated memory window. Although increasingFig. 7.

As seen in Fig. 10, the electron quasi-Fermi potential ( ) drops pronouncedly from the drain to the pinchoff point. This causes a large gradient in the quasi-Fermi potential and it will compensate the small space charge density and keep the drain current constant. In Fig. 12, it is indicated that both and decrease from the source to the drain. The will decrease to a very small value after pin-choff while there is still a remanent value of .

[2], the voltages in the insulator and the ferroelectric have been assumed to be constant for convenience. This assumption would lead to a large deviation at a large drain voltage. However, in our model here, we remove this limitation and the distributions of voltages are calculated as well.1796 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 49, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2002Fig. 13. Memory windows as a function of applied bias of MFMIS capacitor with various area ratios A =A . The other parameters are the same as Table I.Fig. 14.

The inset is thecorresponding C–V relation of MFMIS capacitors with the same A =A asin MFMISFETs.For MFMIS capacitor, the memory windows increase withdecreasing area ratio, , as shown in Fig. 13. For a smallvalue in area ratio, the memory window increases with appliedbias and attains the maximum memory window rapidly. Fig. 14displays the–of MFMISFET and–of MFMIS capac-itor for various area ratios at the writing voltages of 5 V. Thememory window increases from 1 V to 1.7 V as the area ratiodecreases from 1 to 0.2. The MFMIS structures with small arearatio can easily drive the ferroelectric layer to saturated polar-ization, which is more stable than a minor loop and is expected to have a longer retention time [6], [7] and better repeatability of threshold voltage during switching. However, the accumulation capacitance and the drain current decrease when the area ratio is decreased. This phenomenon is due to the decrease in total gate capacitance of the MFMIS structure that arises from the de-crease of area of MFM, as shown in the inset of Fig. 14. The de-creasing drain current effectively reduces the current ON/OFF ratio in spite of the increasing memory window, which is a draw-back of the device performance. The device designers, therefore, should make certain tradeoffs between the memory window and the drain current when the area ratio decreases.VI. OTHER POSSIBLE EFFECTSA. Fixed ChargesFor an MFIS structure, the fixed charges may reside at the interface of ferroelectric/insulator or of insulator/semicon-ductor. Denoting respectively the fixed charges as and , Gauss’s law then gives(21)and(22)With the existences of and , the voltages across theinsulator and ferroelectric should change to and , respec-tively. Although (22) cannot be solved in an analytical form, wecan expand the solution in the first —order term and the totalshift in the gate voltage due to the fixed charge is then given by(23)B. Charge InjectionIn recent developments of MFIS structures there are many high dielectric constant materials for the insulators. However, with their small bandgaps and polycrystalline structures, they often have large leakage currents and low breakdown voltages. If the device parameter is not carefully designed, the applied voltage mostly lies in the insulator rather than in the ferroelec-tric film, causing a large leakage current or even breakdown. In addition, the interdiffusion problems often generate a large den-sity of trap states, in which the charges may be stored. These ef-fects cause charge injection, which is similar to the operation of flash memory. For example, if a large and negative gate voltage is applied to MFIS capacitor, a positive will be generated due to the leakage currents in the insulator, leading to a nega-tive shift (23) in flat-band voltage. Similarly, a large and positive gate voltage will induce a negative , producing a positive shift in flat-band voltage. Note also that this charge injection can cause a hysteresis loop but with a reverse direction in the ferroelectric memory hysteresis loop. Accordingly, the charge injection will reduce the ferroelectric memory window or even",1399

This formula is derived on the basis of the gradual channel approximation, in which the transverse electric field is much greater than the longitu-dinal one. However, for a short channel device, the influence of source/drain region on the channel and the effect of velocity saturation become important. The overall short channel effects will eventually reduce the drain current that is less than the value estimated in Section IV and increase the subthreshold slope. However, we believe the threshold voltage change between the two polarization states are still close to the estimated using ourLUE et al.: DEVICE MODELING OF FeMFET 1797method, at least in the first order. There also exist many compli-cated effects. For example, the thickness of ferroelectric film in-corporated in FeMFET is often several thousands of angstroms, which is comparable to the channel length if submicron tran-sistor is fabricated. Therefore, the fringing electric fields exist outside the gate area and this effect in turn reduces the gate con-trol capabilities of the transistors. This similar effect has been proposed by Chen et al. [12] for the transistors made of high-gate dielectrics.VII.",305
hang-tinglue2002.docx,CONCLUSION,"In summary, some detailed numerical analyses of MFISFET, MFMISFET, and the associated capacitors have been made for the various material and device parameters. We have presented a new simple and analytical P–E relation for the ferroelectric material, including the nonsaturated polarization. Based on this analytical formula along with Pao and Sah’s double integral for the drain current, the electrical characteristics of the above de-vices can be investigated. First, we have successfully simulated the–memory windows at various applied biases. A simple and clear explanation on the direction of the memory window is also given. Second, the nonuniform distributions of the field and charge along the channel position of the FeMFETs have been taken into account from Pao and Sah’s double integral. The drain current of the FeMFETs operated in all possible regions except the cut-off region can be calculated by this way. Third, other possible effects such as fixed charge, charge injection and the short channel effect are also addressed in the present study. For the MFIS and MFMIS structures, we have found some useful design rules for improving the device performance: De-creasing and , increasing ratio and reducing EOT of the insulators and of the MFMIS structures are the important factors to obtain a saturated memory window at a low operation voltage. Increasing and may also result in a larger memory window, while the voltage required to drive the ferroelectric into saturated polarization is higher. In addition to the memory window, other issues should also be considered. For example, decreasing and , reducing of the MFMIS structures and increasing will reduce the drain current and then the current ON/OFF ratio is decreased. Care must be taken to avoid possible breakdown or charge injection of the insulator due to the small thicknesses and high voltage drops across them. Besides, it is suggested to operate the FeMFETs in saturated po-larizations for better retention characteristics. Therefore to op-timize the device performances, certain tradeoff between these parameters should be made. If some clear device specifications are given, the present simulation method can provide the opti-mization of the device parameters.",472

Moreover, its particular switching behavior hasrecently inspired several proposals for unconventional appli-cations, including artificial neurons [2] and synapses [3], [4],ferroelectric oscillators [5], logic-in-memory devices [6], [7] and random number generators [8]. However, FeFETs havea rather limited cycling endurance, which typically ranges between 104and 107cycles [9]–[13], depending on the struc-ture, fabrication and cycling process. The related degradation has been mainly attributed to the wear-out of the interfacebetween HfO2 and silicon, driven by the charge trapping upon the bipolar voltage cycling [14]. Such a limitation might bethe main bottleneck for the success of some of the above-mentioned applications and, thus, strategies for increasing thenumber of switching cycles are needed.Recently, local annealing methods have been investigated for improving or restoring the degraded performance of logicand memory devices.

However, further cycling rapidly leads to performance degra-dation and to the complete collapse of the memory window after 105cycles (endurance failure, Fig. 1b).Interestingly, by forward biasing the drain-body and source-body junction and performing a DC sweep at room tem-perature as indicated in Fig. 2a, such a post-cycled and nonfunctional FeFET fully regains the switching property and its memory window. The same effect is achieved in the pulsed regime as well, where VF pulses are simultaneously applied at source and drain, while keeping the bulk grounded. For instance, (−3 V, 1 s), and (−4 V, 100 ms) were found to be suited combinations of VF amplitude and duration, where the latter pulse setting will be used in the following",631

A similar healing phenomenon has been previously reported for recover-ing the hot-carrier injection induced damage in short channel logic devices [17]. It should be mentioned that the recovery after cycling can be alternatively achieved just by externally annealing the device at elevated temperatures (e.g. by baking in the oven at 300°C for 2 hours, as shown for comparison in Fig. 2b). Even though this is the first",154

On the other hand, the recovery could not be achieved by applying a write pulse (ERS or PRG) of an excessively large amplitude and/or duration, as has been reported for some sorts of resistive switching devices [22]. This would, namely, lead to the irreversible hard breakdown of the gate-stack.Although the recovered device displays a proper memory window, it might be affected by an undesired shift of the PRG and ERS VT levels and/or a significant change of the switching response. To verify this, we have performed the analysis of the switching voltage of the pre-cycled and of the recovered device by using the gate waveform shown in Fig. 2c. As canFig. 3.

Note that this value is within the cycle-to-cycle statistical dispersion range, which is normally displayed by these devices [8], [21]. In addition, both PRG and ERS VT levels are preserved after the recovery.To gain more insight into the performance of the recovered device, we performed data retention and cycling endurance",322

NaMLab_Recovery_of_Cycling_Endurance_Failure_in_Ferroelectric_FETs_by_Self-Heating_TED_2018.docx,results,"clearly confirm the bene-fit of adopting the self-heating pulses, this approach can-not be used to indefinitely extend the cycling endurance in FeFETs. Indeed, the memory window collapses before reaching 106cycles, after which the device cannot be recov-ered anymore. This might be explained by assuming that the rate of defect generation under 104PRG/ERS cycles is larger than the healing rate upon a self-heating pulse, which inevitably induces degradation. In fact, the positive and the negative switching pulses approximately correspond to the energy band diagrams of the gate stack depicted in Fig. 5a and 5b, respectively. Owing to the large difference in dielectric constant between HfO2 and SiON, a large portion of the applied VG drops across the thin SiON layer. While this favors a significant tunneling of electrons during PRG (Fig. 5a) and holes during ERS (Fig. 5b), the high interfacial field stress induces the generation of defects and the consequent rapid degradation of SiON (Fig. 5c) [14]. Since the created defects act as traps for the injected carriers, the charge trapping drastically increases at this point. The so trapped charge counteracts or even impedes the ferroelectric switching, which causes the collapse of the memory window after 105cycles without healing pulses (Fig. 5c). Nevertheless, this failure is recoverable with VF pulses (Fig. 5d), since the defects are located in the proximity of the generated heat. How-ever, further cycling (N > 105) induces the generation andFig. 5. Energy band diagrams of the gate stack during (a) PRG and (b) ERS operation.

Thus, the gate dielectric stack dominated by ferroelectric negative capacitance is more favorable for enhancing the stability of ferroelectric switching.The high-speed endurance test was also tested for ferroelec-tric versatile memories with low- and high-nitrogen-content TaN gates. A read scheme using ION/IOFF ratio is adopted to define sense margin and monitor ON/OFF switching states. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the “0” state and “1” state can be identified by OFF-state and ON-state currents of transistor transfer char-acteristic. In Fig. 4(b), the fast drain-current response reveals that the speed of ferroelectric–antiferroelectric transition can be reached at 20 ns for both program and erase operation. The fast ferroelectric domain switching like static random access memory and DRAM can be used for cache and main memory.For one-transistor memory device, the read and write scheme has been proposed [19]. The sense margin is defined by IOFF/ION ratio under program and erase states. Fig. 4(c) depicts the IOFF/ION and SS dependence of endurance char-acteristics under the program/erase voltages of ±5 V. For high-strain-gate with 10% N2, the much lower IOFF/ION ratioFig. 4. (a) Transistor transfer characteristic curve. (b) 20-ns ID response current waveforms.

The IOFF/ION must be as low as possible in DD(ξ+order to obtain small VDD for power saving. It is worth noting that both IOFF and IOFF/ION keep stable without significant degradation before 106cycles, indicating the gate-stack suffer small damage during program/erase cycling. Furthermore, the high-strain-gate case with a steeper sub-60 mV/dec SS exhibits a better fatigue endurance over 1012cycles than that of low-strain-gate case. This is because the high-strain-gate case is accompanied with stronger ferroelectric polarization and lower depolarization field. Thus, the sub-60 mV/dec SS characteristics originated from the negative capacitance effectThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination.4 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICESFig. 5. Schematic band diagrams of gate-stack using control HZO dielectric (positive capacitance) and ferroelectric HZO dielectric (negative capacitance).can effectively suppress the IOFF (IOFF ∝ 10−VT/SS) and thus stabilize the IOFF/ION ratio.To explain the energy-efficient ferroelectric switching behavior in versatile memory, the schematic band diagram illustrating the operation mechanism is shown in Fig. 5. Com-pared to traditional HZO dielectric with positive capacitance, the ferroelectric negative capacitance of orthorhombic-phase HZO dielectric can amplify the surface potential (ψs) to reach the strong inversion and fast domain polarization at a corre-spondingly low driving voltage. Thus, the program and erase voltages can be prominently reduced to lower memory switch-ing energy. Besides, the fast ferroelectric negative capaci-tance switching also enhances the electron tunneling efficiency through gate injection mechanism under negative gate voltage. This part has been verified by fast pulse endurance test with a 20-ns speed in Fig. 4. Therefore, this versatile memory achieves not only the ferroelectric polarization enhancement by strain-gate technique, but also the energy-efficient switch-ing through a negative capacitance effect.IV.",891

Sanchez_domain_matching_CGD_2019.docx,ABSTRACT,": Epitaxial ferroelectric HfO2 films are the most suitable to investigate intrinsic properties of the material and for prototyping emerging devices. Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2(111) films were epitaxially stabilized on La2/3Sr1/3MnO3(001) electro-des. This epitaxy, considering the symmetry dissimilarity and the huge lattice mismatch, is not compatible with conventional mechanisms of epitaxy. To gain insight into the epitaxy mechanism, scanning transmission electron microscopy character-ization of the interface was performed, revealing arrays of dislocations with short periodicities. These observed periodicities agree with those expected for domain matching epitaxy, indicating that this unconventional mechanism could be the prevailing factor in the stabilization of ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 with (111) orientation in the epitaxial Hf0.5Zr0.5O2(111)/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3(001) heterostructure.Downloaded via GEORGIA INST OF TEC See https://pubs.acs.org/sharingguidelines for o1.",291

All these phases are nonpolar. However, other metastable polar polymorphs whose energy is close to the stable phases exist,epitaxial HfO2 is of major relevance.Polycrystalline ferroelectric HfO2 is typically obtained by annealing amorphous nanometric films.

Surface and interface energy contributions, and changes in energy caused by lattice strain in the crystallized films, can be a very relevant fraction of the total energy due to the nanometric sizes.9,25Moreover, even if the monoclinic phase is thermodynamically stable at room temperature, the trans-formation from another phase, when the film is cooled, could be kinetically suppressed.26A different method to form the and among them, there are two orthorhombic structures (oIII: 29, Pca21, and oIV: 31, Pmn21),8,9,11and recently a polar rhombohedral phase (160, R3m) has been also reported.12,13 The interest in ferroelectric HfO2 emerges from the full compatibility with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology of the chemical composition and the deposition processes to obtain polycrystalline ferroelectric HfO2 films.14However, the current knowledge on ferroelectric hafnia needs to be improved.. In this regard, epitaxial films15−19 can be useful to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing HfO2 properties, as well as to prototype nanometric HfO2-based devices.. Examples of the usefulness of epitaxial films include observation of coercive electric field (Ec) scaling with thickness (t) according to the Ec ≈ t−2/3dependence (elusive for polycrystalline HfO2),20absence of wake-up effect,21−23 and disentanglement and control of ionic and electronic transport contributions in tunnel devices.24Since these significant advances may be crucial for the further improve- metastable phase is epitaxial growth, generally by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) at high temperature.. In this deposition process, contrary to the annealing of amorphous films, crystallization of the atoms that arrive from the gas phase occurs in a very short time scale.27In the early growth stage, the contribution of the substrate/film interface energy is larger than the bulk energy.. The energy of an incoherent interface is much higher than that of a coherent or semicoherent one, and thus a particular polymorph will form if the crystal surface of the used substrate permits (semi)coherent growth.28The Received: January 22, 2020 Revised: April 20, 2020 Published: April 20, 2020 © 2020 American Chemical Society 3801 https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.cgd.0c00095 Cryst..",561

The atomic arrangement of LSMO implies an in-plane distance between cation columns parallel to the interface of ∼2.807 Å, corresponding to the (110) interplanar distance. On the one hand, this distance is determined by the GdScO3 substrate, since the LSMO layer grows fully strained on it.19On the other hand, the atomic arrangement of o-HZO, somewhat more complex, has been simulated using VESTA software consid-ering calculated lattice constant for orthorhombic (Pca21) HfO2.37,38Our STEM",767

Here, the contrast between atomic columns across the interface also suggests, as in the [−211] grain presented in Figure 3, that the semicoherent interface develops after one monolayer of pseudomorphic HZO. The analysis of the semicoherent interface (Figure 4b,c) shows much smaller domains compared to [−211] variants.

In addition, ferroelectric (FE) HfO2 can exhibit memristive behavior in ferroelectric tunnel junctions2(FTJs) and ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs),3which indicates its potential forappropriate TE can thus enhance the FE properties of HfO2. There has since been extensive research exploring various TEs such as Pt,6Mo,7W,8TaN,9and RuO2,10but reactively sputtered TiN is prominent.1,2,5,11Even so, reports are scarce on the effect of varying its microstructure. Depositionconditions such as plasma power, pressure, and gas mixture can strongly influence the microstructure of metals deposited by reactive sputtering, which in turn can affect the strain in the film.In this work, we study the impact of processing conditionsfor reactively sputtered TiN, when used as a TE for FEapplication in neuromorphic computation. The ferroelectricity in HfO2 is believed to originate from a noncentrosymmetric orthorhombic phase (o-phase) Pca21, formed when a thin HfO2 film is crystallized under the appropriate stress and annealing conditions. It has been demonstrated that a tensile in-plane stress in the HfO2 induces a transition from the tetragonal phase (t-phase) to the preferred o-phase, thus leading to ferroelectricity.4This is commonly achieved by doping the HfO2 and has been accomplished with a wide variety of dopants, with Zr being the most common due to its wide range of doping concentrations, yielding FE properties.5 Apart from suitable doping, Böscke et al. highlighted the importance of the top electrode (TE) and its capping ability in achieving the o-phase.1It is believed that similar to theHf1−xZrxO2. By employing a combination of electrical characterization and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), we reveal the importance of (111) textured TiN in achieving FE Hf1−xZrxO2. We further use X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure to strengthen our findings.

Suman_Interfacial_FEFET_TED_2018.docx,Abstract,"— We fabricate, characterize, and establish the critical design criteria of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO)-based ferro-electric field effect transistor (FeFET) for nonvolatile mem-ory application. We quantify VTH shift from electron (hole) trapping in the vicinity of ferroelectric (FE)/interlayer (IL) interface, induced by erase (program) pulse, and VTH shift from polarization switching to determine true memory win-dow (MW). The devices exhibit extrapolated retention up to 10 years at 85 °C and endurance up to 5 × 106cycles initiated by the IL breakdown. Endurance up to 1012cycles of partial polarization switching is shown in metal–FE–metal capacitor, in the absence of IL. A comprehensive metal–FE–insulator–semiconductor FeFET model is developed to quantify the electric field distribution in the gate-stack, and an IL design guideline is established to markedly enhance MW, retention characteristics, and cycling endurance.Index Terms— Charge trapping, ferroelectric FET (FeFET), Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO), interlayer (IL).I.",269
Suman_Interfacial_FEFET_TED_2018.docx,INTRODUCTION,"T HE discovery of ferroelectricity in doped HfO2 has triggered significant interest in FeFET-based nonvolatilememory (NVM), due to its scalability and CMOS compatibil-ity [1].

However, HZO-based FeFET for NVM is rarely evaluated.One serious challenge of HfO2-based FeFET is that the charge trapping in HfO2 during write cycle counteracts polar-ization switching and degrades memory window (MW) [5]. Due to relatively large density of defects in HfO2, significant amount of charge trapping is induced by the write pulse. In addition, the charge release process after charge trapping affects read-after-write operation and limits the operation speed. Therefore, it is important to quantify the extent of charge trapping and detrapping.Finally, the theoretical MW in FeFET is approximately 2EC × tFE (EC is the coercive field and tFE is the FE thickness) [6], but most reported HfO2-based FeFETs exhibit≈ 10 nm, about half of the MW around 1 V for tFE maximum MW. We show that MOSFET load line reducesthe voltage across FE, forcing it to work on a nonsaturated polarization loop, which reduces the MW. Based on a com-prehensive FeFET model, we demonstrate that MW can be improved by optimizing the electric field distribution in the gate-stack through the utilization of high-κ interlayer (IL) dielectric.In this paper, a gate-last HZO-based FeFET memory is presented. Charge trapping is separated from polarization switching, and charge release dynamic is investigated. Detailed memory performance and reliability characterization are also performed. In the end, design optimization of the gate-stack to improve MW is demonstrated.II.",789

In addition,charge trapping broadens and shifts the VTH distribution inan array, as shown in Fig. 2(d), compared with no trappingcase. Thus, the emerging FeFET memory technology needs anempirically validated reliable model to quantify intrinsic MWfor arbitrary write voltages in the presence of charge trapping.Fig. 3 shows the modeling framework based on the FE interpretation of the static Preisach theory of hysteresis [7].

It shows that the analytic function could well capture the saturation loop and give an approximate description of the nonsaturated inner loops. Note that the overestimation of the inner loop polarization charge is because the model is a static one, which does not consider the polarization switching delay at low VFE.IV.",139
Suman_Interfacial_FEFET_TED_2018.docx,DISCUSSION,"A. Theoretical Memory WindowThe theoretical MW is modeled using the approach outlined in Fig. 3. Fig. 5(a) shows the ψS–VG curves, which capture the hysteresis as VG is swept forward and backward, due to polar-ization switching. The VG separation between the intersection points at ψS = 2φB denotes the MW. Fig. 5(b) shows the field effect transistor load lines at threshold voltages during forward and backward VG sweep. When VG sweeps from −4 to 4 V,drops across the SiO2 IL and Si channel, the FE operates on VFE is only from −1 V to 1 V. Since most of the gate voltagea nonsaturated inner loop with lower polarization, resulting in reduced MW.The inner loop FE operates on strongly depends on the VG sweep range and saturation remnant polarization (Pr), as shown in Fig. 5(c). The larger the VG range and the larger the Pr, the closer MWideal is to 2EC × tFE limit. Measured MW tracks the simulation result very well.B. Charge Trapping and DetrappingThe measurement of MW is conducted by applying pulse sequence shown in Fig. 6. Program/erase pulses are applied and then each followed by measurement pulses. The measure-ment range is chosen such that it does not disturb the FE polarization state. By tuning the time delay (T1/T2) between program/erase pulse and measurement, the amount of trapped charge sensed can be varied. Measured FeFET ID–VG charac-teristics after program and erase for time delay of 1 μs and 1 s are shown in Fig. 6. With 1 μs of sense delay, trapped charge narrows the MW, consistent with Fig. 1(c).Fig. 5. (a) Surface potential (ψS) versus VG (−4 V, +4 V). (b) MOSFET load lines intersect the QFE–VFE inner loop (dark blue loop) for VTH1 (red curve) and VTH2 (green curve) configuration states (c) MWideal versus remnant polarization (Pr) for different VG ranges. MW widens with larger VG sweep range and larger Pr.On the other hand, the VTH shift solely arising from charge trapping contribution is ascertained by monitoring the electron/ hole release dynamics after erase/program, as shown in Fig. 7. An initial program/erase pulse is applied to set the device to a reference state, and (VTH)ref is extracted from subsequent ID–VG measurement. The release dynamics is monitored by probing drain current at certain time intervals after erase/program pulse. This type of one spot measurement has been widely applied to study the charge release for negative bias temperature instability study [10]. VTH shift during release could be obtained from the probing current.The",616

This is consistent with the estimated defect densities in HfO2 [5] Fig. 8(a) and (b) shows the electron/hole trapping as a function of applied stress pulse duration and amplitude.NI et al.: CRITICAL ROLE OF IL IN HZO FeFET NVM PERFORMANCE 2465Fig. 9. Energy band diagram during (a) erase and (b) program pulses. Corresponding polarization is shown in green arrow. Charge trapping is also indicated.The device is initialized in such a way that no polarization switching occurs during stress. The rising/falling edges of the stress pulse are used to measure the ID–VG transfer characteristics before and after stress, whose VTH difference represents charge trapping during stress. Charge trapping increases with stress amplitude and saturates with duration, suggesting trapping at preexisting traps, instead of defect generation, with electron trapping more efficient than hole trapping. Note that the extractedVTH underestimates the actual amount of charge trapping, because the charge trapping during the rising edge reduces the amount of available defects for trapping during stress. This amount of significant charge trapping is partially due to polarization, which enhances the IL electric field, assisting charge injection from channel [5]. The effect of HZO thickness on charge trapping is also studied, as shown in Fig. 8(c). An approximate linear increase ofVTH with HZO thickness at small pulse widths (<1 μs) suggests that the charge trapping is in IL. At long pulse widths,VTH shows a saturating dependence on HZO thickness. It is likely that at small pulse widths, the charge trapping happens only in the IL due to limited available time for trapping. At longer pulse widths, charge trapping will happen in the FE, beyond the IL. This saturation dependence on the FE thickness and the short time scale (<10 ms) suggests that charge trapping mainly happens adjacent to the FE/IL interface, not in theFig. 10.

Suman_kai_variability_FeFET_VLSI_2019.docx,Abstract,": In this work, we present a comprehensive Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) modeling based statistical framework to evaluate the device-to-device variation of thin-film HfO2 ferroelectric FET (FeFET). We conclude that the closing of the memory window in a FeFET array with device scaling can be attributed to: 1) limited number of domains; 2) variation among domains; 3) intrinsic stochasticity of individual domain switching. To enable further scaling of FeFET, co-optimization approaches from material, process, and device operation to control variation are proposed: i) increase the number of domains through material/process optimization (e.g. decrease of deposition temperature, etc.); ii) improve the uniformity of domains (e.g. minimizing the domain size variation and defect distribution, etc.); iii) increase the pulse amplitude/width to ensure deterministic switching of individual domains.",191
Suman_kai_variability_FeFET_VLSI_2019.docx,Introduction,": FeFETs based on ferroelectric HfO2 are a promising candidate for embedded nonvolatile memory (NVM), due to its CMOS compatibility, scalability, and energy efficiency. Successful integration of HfO2 FeFET within an industrial scale advanced CMOS technology platform has been demonstrated[1]. Promising as it is, several key challenges remain. The first challenge is to mitigate the electron and hole trapping during write to improve the endurance[2]. The second challenge is to reduce the write voltage to a logic-compatible level[3]. This work focuses on the third challenge, the device-to-device variation, which increases with the FeFET device size scaling, ultimately causing the memory window collapse for aggressively scaled FeFET arrays[1] (Fig.1). In this work, we develop a comprehensive statistical framework to model and evaluate the variation of FeFET with the scaling, supported by",191
Suman_kai_variability_FeFET_VLSI_2019.docx,experiment,"al data, which guides co-optimization of material /process conditions and prescribes operating bias conditions. KMC Simulation Framework: The ferroelectric is assumed to contain N elementary domains (Fig.3) with each domain switching independently. The switching of an individual domain between two polarization states is modeled with a master equation[4] (Fig.2). The original framework treats the switching between two stable states as a double-well potential separated by an energy barrier[4]. This is not applicable for thin film HfO2[5], where polarization switching is nucleation limited. Therefore, the framework is adapted to capture the nucleation-limited switching dynamics by adjusting the transition rates. As the single domain switching is stochastic[5], the KMC simulation is a natural means to study the variation of FeFET (Fig.3). A Gaussian distribution of the activation field (Ea) is assumed. The equations governing the voltage division and the charge balance between the ferroelectric and the MOSFET are solved to obtain the ferroelectric electric field (EFE), which is then used to calculate the switching rates. Thereafter, the KMC algorithm is executed.Variation in Metal-Ferroelectric-Metal (MFM) Capacitor: We validate this modeling approach using measured data from an MFM capacitor. Fig.4 shows the calibration of the QFE-VFE saturation loop. The switching dynamics under various applied voltages are captured by the KMC model (Fig.5a). When the number of FE domains decreases from 1,000 to 20, the switching occurs in discrete steps and the variation increases significantly (Fig.5b). This is due to the intrinsic stochastic nature of individual domain switching. The effect of single domain switching (of the order of 1/N) now becomes significant. Fig.6 quantifies the variation in the PFE after program/erase operation. With the reduction in the number of domains with device area scaling, the program and erase states start to overlap, which leads to memory window collapse. Variation in Ferroelectric FET: The switching dynamics is measured in a state-of-the-art 28nm high-κ metal gate FeFET technology[2] (Fig.7a). The device features an 8nm thick doped HfO2 with 1nm SiO2 interlayer (Fig.7c). The typical grain size in 10nm HfO2 is around 10-15nm[6], which means that there are approximately 1,000 switching elements for a 500nm by 500nm FeFET. The KMC model accurately reproduces the measured switching dynamics (Fig.7b). The evolution of the polarization charge during the write operation (Fig.7d) explains how the device-to-device variation increases as the number of domains decreases. The deviation of PFE from its expectation value originates from single domain switching events, which have a strong impact when limited number of domains participate in the switching process. The measured (Fig.7e) and modeled (Fig.7f) variation show the collapse of the memory window as a function of FeFET device dimensions. Control of Variation in Ferroelectric FET: With the insights from the modeling, several approaches controlling the variation in FeFET are explored. The first is to increase the number of ferroelectric domains through careful material /process co-optimization (Fig.8a). Effective fabrication techniques, such as lower deposition temperature[7], enhanced electrode surface roughness, higher annealing temperature[8], can be applied to reduce the grain size. The second method is to increase the domain uniformity. The decrease of the variance of the activation field improves the memory window (Fig.8b), which may be achieved by minimizing the size variation, defect distribution, etc. among the domains[5]. Another set of techniques involve the optimization of the write pulses, where increasing the pulse width (Fig.8c) or pulse amplitude (Fig.8d), decreases the measured variation. Through modeling, we confirm this dependence (Fig.8e and Fig.8f), as the switching becomes less stochastic under high EFE or large pulse width[5]. As the write in FeFET is voltage-driven with excellent energy efficiency, the increase in pulse amplitude or pulse width may be an acceptable compromise for improving variation.",909

Miko_NaMLab_FE_memories_IEEE_2019.docx,Abstract,"— Ferroelectric materials are characterized by two stable polarization states that can be switched from one to another by applying an electrical field. As one of the most promising effects to realize nonvolatile memories (NVMs), the application of ferroelectrics in NVMs has been studied since the 1950s. In principle, three different ways to read out the ferroelectric polarization are known: measuring the charge-related current that flows during switching of the fer-roelectric, measuring the polarization-dependent tunneling current in very thin ferroelectric layers, and measuring the threshold voltage shift of a ferroelectric field effect transis-tor caused by the polarization change of the ferroelectric integrated into the gate stack. While early attempts used bulk ferroelectric crystals, the first commercial success was reached when the concept was integrated into a MOS process. However, all materials that were known to exhibit ferroelectricity had a very complicated structure, thus mak-ing the integration troublesome and leading to a very slow scaling and limiting its application to niche markets. With the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide in 2011, the new impetus came into the field for all three variants described above. This article will describe the history of ferroelectric memories and its current status both with respect to the commercialization of ferroelectric memories based on traditional ferroelectric materials and the ongoing research and development activities employing the more recently discovered ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide. This finally leads us to an outlook of the future challenges for ferroelectric memories.Index Terms— Barium titanate, CMOS, ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET), ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM), ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ), fer-roelectrics hafnium oxide, lead zirconium titanate (PZT), perovskites.I.",392

Therefore, ferroelectricity requires that the material will not be centrosymmetric.. In inorganic ferro-electrics, e.g., those having the perovskite structure such as lead zirconium titanate (PZT) or barium titanate (BTO) or a layered perovskite structure such as strontium bismuth tantalite (SBT), one central ion can switch between two stable positions [see Fig.. 1(b)].. In organic ferroelectrics such as polyvinylidene flouride (PVDF) that is typically copolymerized with tetraflu-oroethylene (TRFE) to stabilize the ferroelectric β phase, the polar polymer chains constitute the dipole and are assumed to rotate during switching [see Fig.. 1(c)].. Finally, in fluoride structure ferroelectrics such as the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase in hafnium oxide, the oxygen ions can switch between two stable positions [see Fig.. 1(d)].. When implementing a ferroelectric material as the active material into a memory cell, different readout mechanisms are possible.. First, the charge during the switching or nonswitching operation can be used [2]–[4].. For these, a capacitor having the ferroelectric material as the dielectric can be biased in a certain direction.. As a result, the ferroelectric will not switch if it was previously polarized in the same direction and it will switch if it was polarized in the opposite direction.. In the latter case, free charge attached on both electrodes to compensate for the polarization charge will be released by opposite switching, and this extra charge will be transferred, thus leading to a higher current flow in the outer circuit.. This capacitor-based readout scheme, therefore, destroys the stored information, and a write-back is necessary.. This readout scheme is used in ferroelectric random access memories (FeRAMs).. Second, the ferroelectric can be implemented as part of the gate dielectric of a ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) [4].. The polarization will lead to a shift of the I–V curve of the transistor that can be used to determine the state of the ferroelectric polarization in a nondestructive way.. Finally, for thin ferroelectrics [5] or a double-layer structure of a ferroelectric combined with a thin tunneling layer [6], the polarization state of the ferroelectric can be directly read out as the current flowing through the capacitor..",550

In the concept of the antiferroelectric RAM (AFeRAM) [52], [53], a built-in bias field is used to shift the hysteresis, so that at 0-V applied bias, a nonvolatile state will exist that is absent in an antiferroelec-tric [54]. The voltage required to switch between the two states is reduced, and the switching is between one polarized state and one nonpolarized state, thus leading to lower switching voltage and better endurance [55]. This AFeRAM approach is still in its infancy, but it illustrates that there are plenty of ideas on the table to solve the remaining issues of making the new class of hafnium oxide-based ferroelectric materials ready to finally realize the dream of a nonvolatile version ofstackofafieldeffecttransistortorealizeaFeFET[see Fig. 4(a) and (d)], in principle, two basic limitations of the capacitor-based solution can be overcome. First, the read becomes nondestructive, and second, the device does not require a 3-D integration since the FET is sensitive to the charge per area that is maintained during scaling. The idea of building such a device dates back to the year 1957 [56], and a first realization was shown a few years after that [57]. As a result, the idea seems to be very intriguing, and consequently, many research activities were focused on the topic. A very good overview can be found in [58]. The work focused on three main challenges for about foura DRAM. decades:Authorized licensed use limited to: ASIF KHAN. Downloaded on April 07,2020 at 15:13:03 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

For a long time, it was the sole goal of semiconductor memories to realize the random access memory application; unlimited endurance was required. With the establishment of Flash memories as NVMs with much lower write endurance requirements in the range of 105, this boundary condition—as in Flash memory—seems to be achievable although little",1148
Miko_NaMLab_FE_memories_IEEE_2019.docx,experiment,"al data are available here due to the dominatingto get a good effect, the ferroelectric capacitor needs to be made much smaller than the FET gate capacitor, and therefore, the cell size will be limited by the lithographic capability of forming the second electrode [66]. Moreover, the charging of the internal floating node will pose an unknown problem for the endurance of such a device. It seemed that all the research was not showing a lot of progress. But in 2004, finally, the first FeFET with ten years of nonvolatile retention was shown by Sakai and Ilangovan [67] by using a HfAlO buffer layer together with an optimized and rather thick SBT film. [see Fig. 4(a)–(c)]. Although being a major achievement, again the device was trapped in a scalability dilemma. To scale down the channel length, the thickness of the ferroelectric would also have to be scaled down. However, the memory window of the FeFET is dictated by the coercive voltage of the ferroelectric that, in turn, is proportional to the thickness of the ferroelectric [68]. Therefore, besides better CMOSissue number two. compatibility, a higher coercive field is highly desirable forMany different material options have been tried out. While issue one can be overcome by adding an interface layer between the semiconductor channel [59] and the ferroelectric or even splitting up the complete capacitor stack into a MOS capacitor and an MFS capacitor connected in series [60], this exacerbates issue two. Considerable work was then focused on using different materials for the interface oxide. Therefore, this issue was the dominant research topic for many years, and it seemed almost unsolvable in the early 2000s [9]. From the analysis in [9], we can learn that two aspects will help. First, the dielectric constant of the ferroelectric needs to be as low as possible and the dielectric constant of the interface layer should be high to achieve a favorable voltage divider. Second, a high coercive field helps to stabilize the stored state. Several alternative material options for the ferroelectric have been tried over the years. Barium magnesium fluoride (BaMgF4) and bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12) [61] were used to overcome the issue number one in a time where GaAs-based devices were considered a very interesting option for the future and GaAs was also considered as possible semiconductor platform to realize memories. Polymer ferroelectrics have a very low permittivity on the order of 2, and a rather high coercive field (see Table I) seems to be very well suited to tackle both issues one and two. Promising devices have been fabricated only ten years ago [62] since it took quite a while to optimize the material properties (see the chapter on capacitor-based memories). However, integrating a polymer into the gate stack of FeFET is not possible due to the limited thermal budget; the material can withstand after deposition. Therefore, this is again a path available to organic electronics only. The attempt of utilizing rare Earth-based ferroelectrics such as CeMnO3 with permittivity values below ten was proposed by Cova Inc., Miami, FL, USA, in the early 2000 s [63] and never produced notable",696
Miko_NaMLab_FE_memories_IEEE_2019.docx,results,". Therefore, the attention went back to the clas-sical materials such as PZT and SBT. For the interface oxide, CeO2 [64] was a very popular option, but many other materials with higher k values were tried as well. Another possibility to reduce the depolarization field is to decouple the area of the ferroelectric capacitor from that of the gate capacitor in the FET by adding an additional metal electrode [65]. However,the ferroelectric material used in a FeFET. Since ferroelectric HfO2 has both properties already, some of the articles dealt with FeFETs [69], [70] immediately showed data that could outperform earlier FeFETs based on traditional ferroelectrics and at the same time using a scaled-down gate stack. This led to a very strong interest both from academia and industry. In 2016, first data on a fully integrated test array showing both ferroelectric and standard devices using GlobalFoundries’28-nm FeFET process could be shown [71], and one year later, the technology was also demonstrated using GlobalFoundries’22-nm FDSOI technology [71], [72] [Fig. 4(d)–(f)].However, the large coercive field is not strictly beneficial. As in the case of capacitor-based devices, it leads to rather high rewriting voltages of 3–4 V and imposes high stress to the ferroelectric during cycling. Moreover, the inherent dielectric layer at the interface to the silicon channel is subject to very strong field stress during the write operation [73]. This, in turn, leads to strong charge trapping that will eventually degrade the interface oxide and limit the cycling endurance [74], [75]. However, a typical NVM endurance of about 105write cycles is shown at the array level [71], [76]. In addition, the cycling behavior of the memory cell can be further improved by tuning the electrostatics with slightly thicker ferroelectrics [77] or use self-heating to periodically heal the cycling damage [78]. When FeFET devices scaled down to a few 10-nm both in channel length and channel width direction become available, new phenomena can be explored as well. While larger devices show a gradual switching and can be operated in a subloop condition to either allow a very high cycling endurance [79] or adjust a large number of polarization values that can be used for analog storage like in neuromorphic computing [80], scaled-down devices show a limited number of threshold voltage (VT ) levels that can be related to switching of individual domains [81]. This new feature can not only be used to study such effects in nanoscale ferroelectrics but also enable new applications like realizing a random number generator [82] or even greatly simplify the construction of artificial CMOS compatible neurons [83].

Moreover, the ferroelectricity in the gate stack of a FeFET can also be exploited in a totally different way. If the region between the two stable polarization states can be stabilized, a negative differential capacitance region could be achieved that allows voltage amplification [87] and reduces the subthreshold swing and can increase the drive current [88]. This interesting application is beyond the scope of this article. Returning to memories, it has been shown that HfO2-based FeFETs can be integrated into a silicon–ferroelectric–silicon (SFS)-based 3-D NAND architec-ture [89], [90], which provides another interesting path toward a storage class memory. Note that two interface layers to doped Si electrodes enhance the required switching voltages, which, in turn, reduces the lifetime of the devices.IV. FTJSThe third variant of reading out the polarization of a ferroelectric is an FTJ. The basic idea is quite old and was proposed by Esaki et al. [91] in 1971. However, its realiza-tion required the ability to fabricate very thin high-quality ferroelectrics, which was not possible for many years. The concept started to materialize in the first decade of the new millennium [5], and received even more interest in the next decade [92], [93]. Therefore, the concept is by far less advanced compared to FeRAM and FeFET, and all available demonstrations are still using very simple test structures mak-ing performance predictions difficult at this point.Fig. 5 illustrates the dominant mechanism in an FTJ using very thin ferroelectric layers to allow direct tunneling [94]. Different screening lengths in the two metal electrodes give rise to a tunneling barrier that is dependent on the polarization direction. Also, the piezo effect can play a role since it will modulate the tunneling distance [5] but is often neglected if small read voltages are used [94]. These and other basic studies show impressive",1269

This is not a useful integration path for memories integrated with CMOS. However, when very thin polycrystalline layers are used, the conduction via grain boundaries will cause an unwanted current component that willFig. 6.

Moreover, it is very hard to achieve stable ferroelectricity in polycrystalline layers of only 2–3 nm of thickness even if ferroelectric hafnium oxide is used [95]. The double-layer tunnel junction illustrated in Fig. 6 can be a useful alternative. Here, the ferroelectric is combined with a very thin tunneling layer such as SiO2 [96] or Al2O3 [6].The thicknesses of both layers need to be carefully adjusted to get an optimum memory window [97]. In such a double-layer tunneling junction, the tunneling current is switched between the direct tunneling through the tunneling barrier [Fig. 6(d)] and the modified Fowler–Nordheim tun-neling through both the tunneling barrier and parts of the ferroelectric [Fig. 6(c)]. This stack also has some shortcom-ings. First, the depolarization field is similar to a FeFET, and therefore, retention needs careful consideration of the stack composition and internal bias fields [98]. Second, the current density will be rather low. The latter problem can be overcome by using a 2T-1 FTJ cell proposed in [99] but at the price of a higher complexity and the necessity of connecting every FTJ directly to the CMOS circuit. However, for neuromorphic applications, small currents may even be beneficial to allow for massive parallel operation [100]. Therefore, FTJs could be a very good fit for fabricating reliable synapses for neuromor-phic systems.V.",527

The two-layer FTJ using doped hafnium oxide could be a possible path for synapses in neuromorphic computing systems.Comparing ferroelectric memories with competing emerg-ing memory concepts such as magnetoresistive memories (MRAM), phase-change memories (PCM), or resistive switch-ing memories based on ion migration (resistive random access memory, RRAM), they are currently behind because of the low level of industry and research activities in the last 15 years. However, they show a number of unique advantages compared to each of the competing technologies. The fact that the writing process is field-driven that gives them the lowest write energy of all NVM mechanisms. This is an advantage compared to all other concepts. Compared to MRAM, the ferroelectric effect persists even at very small structures down to a few unit cells while magnetism always requires many spins to act collectively and radical new innovations with every scaling step. Once ferroelectric memories would get enough traction in the mainstream arena, they could be implemented in new scaled technologies with fewer new specific innovations taking advantage of the full-scaling benefit. This is, in particular, a big plus for the implementation in FeFET and FTJ, where aggressively scaled structures are essential. In comparison to PCM, again, the low write energy in both transitions is a big plus while PCM requires the melting of the material in the reset process that always",699

In con-trast to RRAM based on either ion vacancy migration (also called valence change memories, VCM) or cation migration [also called electrochemical metallization cell or conductive bridging RAM (CBRAM)], the switching mechanism is well-defined and does not require the formation of a filament leading to much more predictable switching behavior. Finally, the aspect of being able to use the same basic switching mechanism for a capacitor-based cell, a transistor-based cell, and a resistive switching cell is unique and can lead to synergies.On the downside, the critical issues of cycling stability and imprint as well as statistical variations of the ferroelec-tric properties on sub-50-nm length scales still need further improvement to make reliable products. The stability issue will be relevant for all three concepts and most important to capacitor-based FeRAM, where a very high-cycling endurance is essential. The statistical variations of the ferroelectric properties are in particular important for FeFET and FTJ, where very small structures are required, while capacitor-based FeRAM needs a larger area due to the sensing requirements anyhow.

To elucidate the FE properties of TiN/HZO/TiN samples, the measurements were performed using the PUND (positive-up negative-down) technique19. Figure 1a is the typical hysteresis P–V loop of TiN/HZO/TiN device after 400 °C of rapid thermal annealing, showing a remnant polariza-tion (Pr) of ~17 μC/cm2and coercive field of −1.4 MV/cm and +1.9 MV/cm. Figure 1b depicts the bright-field (BF) STEM image of TiN/HZO/TiN stack, in which the polycrystalline nature of the HZO thin film as well as the boundaries with TiN metal elec-trodes are visible. In the close-up image of the HZO film (Fig. 1c), o- and m-phases can be identified in certain directions because the m-phase has a non-vertical β angle. Based on the apparent relative angle differences between the two corresponding lattice planes, orthorhombic [0�11] (left square) and monoclinic [0�11] grains (right square) were clearly identified, indicating the coex-istence of the two phases in the HZO film.It is generally accepted that the orthorhombic phase (o-phase) is the origin of ferroelectricity6,20,21. However, there are four different space groups in the o-phase, i.e., Pca21, Pbcm, Pmn21, and Pbca, among which, only the Pca21 and Pmn21 space groupsa20TiN/HZO(10 nm)/TiN24bTiNBFPolarization (uC/cm2)Annealing@400 °CHf0.5Zr0.5O2100–4–20TiN–10–20SiVoltage (V)ceHAADFd(011)o phase [011](011)m phase [011](100)90°(100)83.5°Fig. 1 Planar metal–ferroelectric–metal (MFM) capacitors. a Typical P–Vloop (2.5 kHz) of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) film derived from positive-up negative-down (PUND) measurements. b STEM-BF image of the TiN/HZO/TiN stack.

The Pmn21 phase could be easily ruled out by the image of the hafnium sublattice. However, distinguishing between the Pbca, Pbcm, and Pca21 space groups is quite challenging, which could only be realized by visualizing the tiny difference of oxygen sublattice.Sang et al.21reported the presence of the o-phase in Gd-doped HfO2 films by using the atomic-resolution STEM high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) technique, in which the projected hafnium sublattices are in good agreement with the o-lattice. Further, in order to distinguish the different space groups of the o-phase, they showed the position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED22) patterns from a certain o-grain that lacks mirror symmetry, to imply the existence of non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic Pca21 structure. However, there is no directly convincing evidence to distinguish the different o-space groups and elucidate the origin of the noncentrosymmetry of Pca21.

Hence, solid evidences on short-range ordering of the oxygen sublattice and displacement in the local domain are essentially required.In order to elucidate the ferroelectric nature of the orthor-hombic phase, the sublattice order of hafnium/zirconium and oxygen atoms was directly detected by using the atomic STEM-HAADF and ABF technique. For HZO lattice, only one direction can maximize the difference in oxygen atomic displacement to identify the different o-phase space groups. Here, [010] is the most suitable zone axis to project the atom columns. It can distinguish monoclinic, orthorhombic, and tetragonal phases, and it is also relatively easily to tell the differences in the oxygen atom arrangement, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.

Switchable Fe diode and 3D integration.. Based on such a thin (~10-nm) ferroelectric layer (HZO), a switchable Fe-diode device was demonstrated, and the fabrication process is shown in Sup-plementary Fig.. 6.. Figure 3a shows the schematic structure of the TiN/HZO/TiN Fe diode, with Schottky contacts formed at the interfaces between the metal electrodes and ferroelectric films.. The positive polarization charges can be neutralized by electrons and then induce the accumulation of electrons in the polarization head side, leading to the reduction of the barrier height; the negative polarization charges can be compensated by oxygen vacancies with positive charge, resulting in upward-band bending.. Thus, the Schottky-to-ohmic contact was formed in the TiN/ HZO/TiN device (Fig.. 3b), leading to a diode-like conduction.. As the polarization switched, the direction of the diode was changed with the direction of polarization.. Figure 3c shows the I–V characteristics of the Fe diode device (the whole I–V curve is shown in Supplementary Fig.. 7).. After sweeping to positive vol-tage, the current changes from low to high, and the state changes from negative-forward diode to positive-forward diode (blue lines).. Similar behavior can be observed in negative voltage sweeping (red lines), where the state changes from positive-forward diode to negative-forward diode.. Due to the existence of Schottky barrier between HZO and electrode, this Fe diode exhibits inherent nonlinearity (more than 100), defined as the ratio of the current read at Vr and Vr/2.. This attribute is important for suppressing the leakage current in a cross-point array, eliminating the necessity of adding an external selector device in series with each memory cell24–26.. Read disturbance is a common issue of two-terminal devices, especially the ferroelectric devices due to its accumulative switching of polarization27.. In the case of polarization state with the same direction of read voltage polarity (e.g., +2 V/100 ns), the read operation has negligible influence on the polarization state (polarization-down, on state) (shown in Supplementary Fig.. 8a)..",523

Initially, TiN bottom electrodes (BEs) of 30-nm thickness were formed by physical vapor deposition (PVD). Thermal ALD at 260 °C was then used to deposit Zr-doped HfO2 films from Hf[N(C2H5)CH3]4 and Zr[N(C2H5)CH3]4. An ALD cycle ratio of 1:1 (Hf-to-Zr precursor pulses) was applied to achieve a Zr content of 50% (cationic ratio of Zr/[Zr + Hf]) in the HfO2 layers. Similar to the BEs, 30-nm-thick TiN top electrodes (TEs) were deposited by PVD. The previously amorphous Zr: HfO2 films were then crystallized by rapid thermal annealing in an N2 ambient at 400 °C for 30 s. The top electron was etched for PFM testing. SiO2 thin film was deposited on the HZO film. After optical lithography and etch process, a hole etched down to the HZO film with a diameter of 2 μm was formed.

VLSI 2020 Sony FeRAM.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Recently, ferroelectric HfO2-based FeRAM has been getting a lot of attention due to its high performance operation and CMOS compatible process [1-2]. Compared to ferroelectric FET (FeFET), 1T1C FeRAM has the advantage of higher endurance, lower voltage operation and disturb free operation [3]. However, a memory array operation using a dedicated circuit such as address decoders and a sense amplifier (SA) for the HfO2-based 1T1C FeRAM has never been reported. In this work for the first time, we fabricated a 64 kbit array using a ferroelectric HfO2-based 1T1C test chip with CMOS logic circuit and demonstrated good array operation yield. Furthermore, MFM capacitor size and operation condition dependency of the test chip on the read voltage margin supports the scalability of the SoC compatible LLC appreciations.

The structure is centrosymmetric and hence does not support spontaneous polarization necessary for a true ferroelectric response. When doped and confined, however, HfO2 thin films have been proposed to undergo a transition to a non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic structure.10,11This has been claimed based on a comparison of HfO2 to the related ZrO2,patterns is complicated due to the mixture of different phases in the film, similarities between the respective reference pat-terns of the potential HfO2 phases, and severe peak broaden-ing of polycrystalline thin films, as shown in Figure 1(b). Moreover, the Pmn21 phase has also been proposed as a candidate following a search for low-energy phases using density functional theory (DFT).15 In this letter, we explore the structural origins of ferroe-lectricity in HfO2 films using aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). We apply high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM imaging to directly observe and quantify the film structure along a vari-ety of crystallographic directions.

The four Hf atoms form a dis-torted face centered lattice with the eight O atoms occupying the pseudo-tetrahedral interstitial sites. Close inspection of Pca21 and Pmn21 phases reveals that oxygen atoms shift along the c axis thereby allowing spontaneous polarization. Here, we focus on the lower symmetry phases of HfO2, i.e., monoclinic and orthorhombic, as the two higher symmetry phases Fm�3m and P42nmc are paraelectric.1,18,19 Due to consistencies with the related ZrO2 system, the Pca21 orthorhombic structure is primarily thought to be the cause of ferroelectricity in HfO2, but this has not been unam-biguously confirmed by",346

Polarization (triangular field sweep, 10 kHz) and small-signal capacitance (triangular bias field sweep, 10 Hz; 150 mV small-signal amplitude, 10 kHz) were measured using a TF Analyzer 3000 by aixACCT Systems. TEM samples were prepared from Gd:HfO2 capacitors using focused ion beam (FEI Helios nanolab 600i dual beam sys-tem).

The collection inner semi-angle and probe semi-convergence angle were approximately 77 mrad and 14 mrad or 20 mrad, respectively.

In the case of the monoclinic structure, only the ½001� is comparable with the orthorhombic structures. For polar phases, Pmn21 and Pca21, the projected Hf arrange-ments are significantly different in all projections except ½100�. We also notice that the other three orthorhombic phases Pca21, Pbcm, and Pbca exhibit very similar arrange-ment of Hf atom columns along all four zone axes with only difference in O atom column arrangement. Thus, the highlighted features in Figure 1 enable the lattice type to be directly determined from HAADF STEM images along different crystal projections.An overview of the thin film microstructure is shown in Figure 3(a), where the layered structure is resolved with the growth direction (G.D.) indicated. The HfO2 grain size is around 10–30 nm, on the order of the film thickness. Two different types of grains, the monoclinic phase and an ortho-rhombic phase, have been generally observed in this HfO2 film.

Moreover, the three structures possess a nearly identi-cal arrangement of Hf, though they vary slightly in their arrangement of oxygen. While these measurements, com-bined with arrangement of projected atom columns, rule out Pmn21 and higher symmetry phases, it is evident that the lattice constants for the orthorhombic structures are difficult to distinguish from lattice parameters alone.To distinguish between the Pbca, Pbcm, and Pca21 phases, we turn to electron diffraction measurements. Underdynamicalconditions,thediffraction intensitiesforanon-centrosymmetric crystal no longer obey Friedel’s rule (reciprocal lattice pairs are no longer required to be of equal intensity). This benefit of electron diffraction has been used to determine the polarity at the nanoscale using CBED methods.26,27The spontaneous polarization in BaTiO3, for example, manifests as the removal of a mirror plane in the pattern.20,28In other words, by examining the symmetry of a CBED pattern, we can rapidly determine if the crystal is cen-trosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric.26,29 Furthermore, nanoscale thin films often have the potential for overlapping grains. It is therefore important to target specific regions of the film for CBED where overlap does not occur, which can be readily achieved with the PACBED technique.20,25 A representative HfO2 thin film region for PACBED analysis is shown in Figure 4(a). The central grain analyzed by PACBED is oriented along ½110�, as shown in the inset. It is important to note that the ½001� axis, which is polar for Pca21, is nearly parallel to the film G.D. This orientation is consistent with the observed out-of-plane ferroelectricity. Furthermore, the intensity distribution of the corresponding PACBED pattern in Figure 4(b) shows a mirror plane (solid bars) along the horizontal direction, but lacks one along the vertical direction (dashed bars), i.e., the left side of the center disc is more intense than the right half.

This paper summarizes the status of GLOBALFOUNDRIES FeFET technology and some of its potential applications. We show excellent 0.12µm2 SRAM yields of our mature 28nm CMOS platform, with co-integrated FeFETs, exhibiting a solid memory window of 1.4V. In contrast to conventional embedded memory cells, the FeFET can be integrated like a regular 26Å EOT transistor, exhibiting two reversibly programmable VT states, while offering full design flexibility. We show state of the art across wafer VT variability of the programmed and erased states of the FeFETs and discuss its layout-dependence. Embedded size-competitive FeFETs already allow solid separation of the memory states, approaching a mature 6Sigma distribution. Reasonable endurance and stable data retention are demonstrated. Moreover, an outlook of this technology beyond the von Neumann computing will be discussed, considering some of the various applications of this new, versatile device.",287

In actuality, the measurement of crystal structure in previous studies has pointed out the ex-istence of the orthorhombic phase.1However, a detailed study on the crystal structure of ferroelectric HfO2-based thin film is difficult due to random orientation of polycrys-talline films..

Recent transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations have ensured the existence of an orthorhombic phase, and simultaneous convergent beam electron diffraction has revealed the space group of Pca21, which is a polar structure and is expected to exhibit ferroelectricity in the orthorhombic phase.10Although TEM observation has a powerful ability for structural a)E-mail: funakubo.h.aa@m.titech.ac.jp analysis, usually it requires reducing thickness with compli-cated processes, i.e., destructive observation..

It is worth mentioning that the post-crystallization of the amorphous film, by which the ferroelec-tric orthorhombic films are obtained, is one way to obtain a solid solution. Another possibility to obtain orthorhombic phase is due to epitaxial strain. The theoretical calculation by Materlik et al. indicates that the epitaxial strain is possible to stabilize ferroelectric orthorhombic phase.21 In order to elucidate that the orthorhombic film in this study is ferroelectric orthrohombic phase, we performed ABF-STEM imaging.

However, further investigation is needed to clarify the ferroelectricity in epitaxial films.The structural phase transition provides strong evidence of ferroelectricity because most polar materials with switchable polarization show a phase transition from high-symmetry para-electric to low-symmetry ferroelectric phases with decreasing temperature. Fortunately, 110 diffraction can be observed in the orthorhombic phase, which is considered to be a ferroelec-tric phase, while such diffraction is not seen in the tetragonal phase, which is expected to be paraelectric. Therefore, 110 dif-fraction is a useful probe for detecting this phase transition.

NamLab - FEFET game changer - good figure - Muller - NVMTS 2014.docx,Abstract,"— In this paper the potential of hafnium oxide as a CMOS-compatible ferroelectric for future memory applications is assessed. The high coercive field strength of ferroelectric hafnium oxide is identified as a key parameter being crucial to device performance. It provides the unique thickness and lateral scaling potential of this novel ferroelectric, while at the same time compromises its endurance properties due to large switching fields. Considering the ambivalent nature of this parameter as well as the emerging trade-off between retention and endurance, voltage controlled operation modes and different device concepts the exceptionally high coercive field strength Ec of FE-HfO2, preserving the memory window at reduced thickness (Figure 1b). Moreover, in the case of the capacitor based solution, the thickness scalability of ferroelectric HfO2 and the availability of mature thin film technologies allow for an area enhancement to the third dimension (Figure 1d). In this paper we critically review the current status of this disruptive technology and assess its future potential by exercising general scaling considerations and device simulations. for ferroelectric hafnium oxide are discussed.

NamLab - FEFET game changer - good figure - Muller - NVMTS 2014.docx,INTRODUCTION,"The first research and development efforts focusing on ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) were started more than 60 years ago [1]. Even though new and promising nonvolatile device concepts have emerged since then, the right to exist for FRAM is still provided by its excellent energy efficiency, fast rewrite speed and low voltage operation capability. Compared to the heat induced switching in PCRAM, spin transfer in STTRAM, ion conduction in RRAM or hot electron injection in NOR-FLASH, the electron efficiency of the polarization induced displacement current in FRAM remains unchallenged. Nevertheless, besides some temporary upturns and the launch of a few niche products, the focus of attention has notably shifted away from FRAM. This is mainly due to the challenging integration and limited scalability of capacitor-based (1T-1C) as well as transistor-based (1T) ferroelectric memory cells [2, 3]. These issues are decisive upon the future of FRAM and can be traced back to the choice of the ferroelectric itself. The commonly utilized perovskites, e.g. PZT or SBT, do not provide the thickness scalability and CMOS-compatibility required for cost efficient, high density 1T-1C or 1T memory solutions (Figure 1 a and c). However, utilizing ferroelectric hafnium oxide (FE-HfO2) based memory devices, this scaling and integration dilemma can be overcome [4 and",307
NamLab - FEFET game changer - good figure - Muller - NVMTS 2014.docx,experiment,"al observation of polarization hysteresis in hafnium oxide based thin films is believed to be due to the appearance of a ferroelectric phase in this system.. However, in order to fulfill the criteria for genuine structural ferroelectricity a deviation from the well-known centrosymmetric polymorphism (monoclinic-tetragonal-cubic) of crystalline hafnium oxide is required.. It is argued that this deviation is the stabilization of an orthorhombic and non-centrosymmetric phase in hafnium oxide thin films.. Due to the displacement of oxygen anions against the cation sub lattice a spontaneous and switchable polarization evolves.. Structurally this phase has already been identified in ZrO2-based ceramics in 1989, but was never tested electrically [5].. The rediscovery of this phase in hafnium oxide thin films in 2011 revealed the potential of these CMOS-compatible transition metal oxides as a novel class of ferroelectrics.. A summary of electrical, electromechanical, as well as structural evidence for this hypothesis is given in [4, 6].. As shown in Figure 2, multiple dopants facilitating the stabilization of this ferroelectric phase have been identified [4].. Other parameters, such as e.g.. grain size, can additionally be utilized to partially stabilize a ferroelectric phase in pure HfO2 as well (to be published elsewhere).. Depending on how well the doping level and/or process is optimized a large ferroelectric phase fraction and therewith a large remanent polarization Pr can be obtained.. Values as high as 45 µC/cm2 for e.g.. the La doped system have already been demonstrated.. However, switching the polarization to the opposite polarity requires comparably large fields.. The coercive field of all hafnium oxide based system investigated so far ranges between 1 and 2 MV/cm..

NamLab - FEFET game changer - good figure - Muller - NVMTS 2014.docx,introduction,"of a suitable ferroelectric: •The memory window is directly proportional to dFE and Ec. Loss of memory window with decreasing dFE can only be compensated with increasing Ec. Solution: The exceptionally high Ec of FE-HfO2 allows for a reduction of dFE to the single digit nanometer range (e.g. Figure 1b). •Depolarization field increases with decreasing dFE. Retention loss can only be compensated by increasing either EC, interface capacitance or substrate doping. Solution: The CMOS compatibility of FE-HfO2 allows for a thin, high capacitance interfacial layer, which together with the high Ec reduces retention loss at scaled dFE. •Ferroelectric properties of the polycrystalline perovskites were found to degrade with decreasing dFE. A ferroelectric, stable with respect to thickness reduction needs to be implemented. Solution: The ferroelectric properties of FE-HfO2 have proven stable down to film thicknesses of 5 nm. Utilizing these clear advantages, FE-HfO2 based FeFETs have been successfully implemented at the 28 nm node ([7], Figure 1b). This demonstration of highly scaled FeFETs has closed the two orders of magnitude scaling gap between FeFET and CMOS that has prevailed ever since the",315
NamLab - FEFET game changer - good figure - Muller - NVMTS 2014.docx,introduction,"of this memory concept. This memory technology is now capable of scaling alongside CMOS, and can be considered a promising candidate for embedded memory applications in future HKMG technologies. However, for scaling beyond the 28 nm technology node, several aspects, such as memory window requirements and transistor technology have to be considered. Especially in the case of an embedded memory it is most desirable to adopt the transistor technology of the corresponding CMOS platform. The scaling considerations depicted in Figure 4 (not drawn to scale) assume a memory window of 1 V, which leads to a ferroelectric film thickness of at least 5 nm. Short channel effects and the actual availability of the platforms are excluded from these considerations. Given the feasibility of a gate length to stack height ratio of LG 28 nm / dFE 10 nm demonstrated in [7], a reduction to LG 14 nm / dFE 5 nm in high-k first / metal last technology (half replacement gate) seems possible (Figure 4a). However, considering the spacer sidewall coverage in high-k last / metal last technology (full replacement gate), a similar reduction of gate length is not possible (see critical dimension illustrated in Figure 4b). Without the suppression or recess of this sidewall coverage the gate fill is no longer possible, and the full replacement gate FeFET does not fully scale beyond the 2X nm node. A similar limitation with a different critical dimension appears when assessing FinFET technology as a host for the FE-HfO2-based FeFETs (the 3D capability of FE-HfO2 required for FinFET integration has already been summarized in the previous section). Due to the",348

(c) FinFET The implementation of FE-HfO2 based FeFETs as an embedded memory for HKMG CMOS technology is especially appealing due to the large similarities of the memory and logic transistors. Due to the high flexibility of FE-HfO2 with respect to electrode material and thermal budget (gate first/gate last), the only requirement for the memory transistor is a thicker and crystalline HfO2. Every other material or gate stack design aspect of HKMG may remain unchanged.

However, polarization sub loops at reduced switching voltage were found to be prone to depolarization and therewith retention loss within the bake period.. Opposite state retention and therewith imprint characteristics were found to be comparable to PZT after 1000 h bake at 125°C..

At the current development stage the endurance of saturated polarization states was found to be limited to about 109 switching cycles.. Hard breakdown (HBD) of the ferroelectric was identified as the failure mechanism limiting endurance.. For unsaturated polarization loops about two orders of magnitude higher endurance and the onset of classical ferroelectric fatigue was observed.. Since in order to achieve sufficient retention saturated polarization loops are required, the endurance of FE-HfO2 at high switching fields needs to be improved..

NamLab - FEFET game changer - good figure - Muller - NVMTS 2014.docx,experiment,"ally be verified [7, 18]. For the non-volatile memory approach, scaling of the FeFET to HKMG technology nodes could finally be achieved. However, endurance characteristics were limited to 104 program / erase cycles which was explained by the degradation of the interfacial layer [21]. Considering the band diagram for the respective gate stack and program / erase conditions at a gate voltage of ±5V (see Figure 6a), severe charge injection can be anticipated from Fowler-Nordheim or direct tunneling alone. Moreover and compared to classical ferroelectrics, simulations show that even though the FE-HfO2 is much more resilient towards depolarization [6], still a significant reduction of spontaneous polarization PS occurs when the gate voltage VG returns to zero (see Fig. 6a bottom left). Recently it was demonstrated that the endurance characteristics of FE-HfO2-based FeFETs can indeed be improved by implementation of different gate stack geometries and operating conditions [18]. By increasing the ferroelectric and interfacial layer thickness to 30 nm and 3 nm respectively and operating the devices at ±4V VG, endurance characteristics of up to 1012 cycles could be demonstrated. Assuming similar ferroelectric properties of the utilized Zr:HfO2 composition [22] and Si:HfO2, simulations reveal that charge injection is quite unlikely, which is, however, caused by the fact that the FeFET is polarized in a severe subloop state (see Figure 6b). This is also reflected in a small memory window of approximately 300 mV which coincides well with",342
NamLab - FEFET game changer - good figure - Muller - NVMTS 2014.docx,experiment,"al observations [18]. For classical SBT-based FeFETs [19], the ferroelectric film is much thicker but can be operated at similar gate voltages due to the low SBT coercive field of approximately 50 kV/cm at 200 nm dFE [20]. However, also for these types of FeFETs, depolarization has always been [9] and remains a challenge as seen by the suploop operation in Figure 6c. Consequently, data retention characteristics could be proven up to a maximum of 30 days for SBT-based FeFETs [23]. In order to give an estimate regarding the reliability characteristics of the presented FeFET approaches (Figure 6a-c), electron tunneling currents during erase operation were calculated based on equations from [24] (see Figure 7). As can be seen from Figure 6a-c, Fowler-Nordheim tunneling applies for NVM FE-HfO2 FeFET cell, whereas for both other FeFET stacks modified Fowler-Nordheim tunneling occurs. Comparing the non-volatile to the volatile FE-HfO2- or to the SBT-FeFET clearly reveals severe differences: The NVM-FeFET suffers from severe charge injection due to the very thin SiO2 interface of 1 nm and an order of magnitude higher electric field. This charge injection can be seen as the most likely cause for accelerated endurance degradation. Since the band bending in Figure 6a shows that charge injection is close to the Fowler-Nordheim regime, increasing the interfacial layer thickness alone is unlikely to improve cycling characteristics (see also [25]). Although charge trapping seems to be detrimental for FeFET endurance, it brings benefit in data retention. The higher amount of trapped charge at higher program/erase amplitudes compensates the polarization charge, which",391
NamLab - FEFET game changer - good figure - Muller - NVMTS 2014.docx,results,"in a decreased depolarization field and improves the retention properties (to be published elsewhere). The presence of charge trapping most likely explains the better retention properties of NVM FE-HfO2 FeFET stack [7], for which 10 years data retention is expected even at 200 °C [4], in contrast to both other FeFET types with a retention capability limited to several minutes [18] and days [23]. Therefore, an MFIS-FeFET memory cell exhibits a trade-off between endurance and retention behavior, where charge trapping is playing the key role. A way to improve the endurance characteristics of MFIS-type FeFETs and at the same time preserve good retention properties was presented in [26]: By lowering PS of the ferroelectric, both the interfacial field stress as well as the depolarization field can be reduced. However, since the PS actually represents an intrinsic material property, it remains to be verified if such a low polarization might not detrimentally affect device statistics [27]. Figure 7. Electron tunneling current density and electric field in the interfacial layer EIL versus tunneling barrier thickness for three types of FeFET cells under their typical erase conditions: non-volatile FE-HfO2 FeFET [7], DRAM-type volatile FE-HfO2 FeFET [18] and SBT-FeFET [19]. In order to improve FeFET memory characteristics without engineering the ferroelectric itself, it might be possible to create MFS-type FeFETs in the future, i.e. eliminating the insulator between HfO2 and the silicon bulk altogether (Figure 6d). Significant progress in the field of epitactically grown HfO2 by ALD and appropriate post annealing steps has been made in the past [28]. If such approaches prove viable in the future, electron injection during erase operations might be reduced due to the different band alignment of the FeFET gate stack (Figure 6e). Moreover, in order to improve the retention characteristics of high PS FeFETs, creating an artificial imprint by workfunction engineering can be envisioned (Figure 6f). By this approach, different FeFET types possessing either destructive- or non-destructive-read out ((N)DRO) characteristics can be created. Due to the imprint created by an adjusted metal gate workfunction, a saturated and a fully depolarized state can be stabilized which could improve the overall FeFET retention characteristics. However, from a memory architecture viewpoint also for these types of FeFETs, write disturbs have to be eliminated by e.g. 2T cell concepts. V.",583
NamLab - FEFET game changer - good figure - Muller - NVMTS 2014.docx,CONCLUSION,"Hafnium oxide emerges as a CMOS-compatible ferroelectric providing unique three-dimensional and lateral scaling potential to capacitor as well as transistor based FRAM.

However, considering the necessity of a large Ec to enable this drastic size reduction an intrinsic dilemma between scaling and device performance of ferroelectric memories evolves. As a consequence, the close to breakdown field operation of FE-HfO2 based MFM capacitors as well as severe charge injection in comparable MFIS-FETs are posing severe endurance constraints on the FE-HfO2 technology in its current development stage.

Even though the yttrium content between different samples was varied, it has been reported that this yttrium content should have no significant influence on the required crystallization temperature.19 To form individual capacitor structures, 55 nm thick cir-tal phases between samples based on the angles of peak dif-fraction intensity. X-ray reflectivity (XRR) scans were also performed on the same Bruker system to verify the thickness and density of different HfO2/TiN sample stacks after the top TiN films were etched away.Figure 1 shows GIXRD measurements that were taken on a set of samples that were fabricated with varying yttrium concentrations. The measurements were taken using constant incidence angle of 0.5�and the detector angle was varied from 15�to 100�.Figure 1(a) shows that as the yttrium concentration is increased from sample to sample, the monoclinic phase of pure HfO2 (characterized by two large reflections around 30�) transforms into a clean tetragonal/cubic phase. The tet-ragonal/cubic phase is characterized by a set of well-defined sharp reflections, which can all be easily identified with a tet-ragonal/cubic powder diffraction pattern known for bulk pol-ycrystalline HfO2.14More interesting, however, are thecular probing pads were deposited onto the top TiN layerreflectionsfromthetransitionaldopingconcentrationsusing an evaporation chamber and a shadow mask.

A zoomed in look at the 80–90�2H range (Fig. 1(b)) shows an additional reflection at 83.5�which disappears for higher yttrium concentrations.

Electrical measurements revealed that between 16 and 24 W of yttrium sputtering power (yttrium concentration between 0.2 and 1.9 mol. %), the hysteresis plots were most pro-nounced. Higher amounts of incorporated yttrium led to a transition to the tetragonal/cubic phase, which is centrosym-metric and therefore paraelectric. However, the transition is not abrupt. A gradual change from ferroelectric curves to paraelectric curves was observed because in the transitional region the film represents a mixture of grains of differentorthorhombic phase was predicted for HfO2 by Lowther et al.,22using an ab initio approach. In such a material, the remanent polarization is due to the displacement of the O atoms against the Hf atoms in the crystal lattice.

This observation is in agreement with the GIXRD measurements for pure HfO2, which showed signs of an orthorhombic phase already starting to stabilize. This isan important finding because it has not been previouslyreported in pure HfO2 thin film capacitors fabricated by ALD deposition. Further investigation is required to deter-mine whether this is a material property of pure HfO2 or if it is a side effect from the sputtering process such as contami-nation or sputter damage.Capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements were also per-formed to further validate the occurrence of ferroelectricity in the Y-doped HfO2 thin films.

Olsen_Y_HfO2_Sputtering_Ferroelectric_APL_2012.docx,conclusion,", yttrium-doped HfO2 thin film (12 nm) capacitors were fabricated by co-sputtering from HfO2 and Y2O3 sources. The samples were characterized by electrical polarization, capacitance-voltage, XPS/RBS, and GIXRD measurements. It was demonstrated that sputtered HfO2 thinfilms show ferroelectric properties when light yttrium dopantconcentrations (0.9–1.9 mol. %) are incorporated. ElectricalpolarizationandCVmeasurementsbothdemonstratedferroelectric characteristics while GIXRD measurements validated that, as proposed for ALD-deposited films, a non-centrosymmetric transitional phase between the lower sym-metry monoclinic and the higher symmetry cubic phase might be the origin for the observed ferroelectric properties. The fact that HfO2 can be stabilized into a ferroelectric state by PVD co-sputtering enhances the understanding of ferroe-lectricity in doped HfO2 and gives a higher degree of free-dom in the optimization of ferroelectric thin film devices, opening the door to additional device applications that can-not be addressed using ALD.This work was financially supported by the Free State of Saxony and the European Union EFRE fund (HEIKO project 100064806).1M.

The lattice parameter ofcycle ratio were not considered in this analysis, since the filmscubic TiN is about 0.424 nm,51while those of orthorhombic HfO2 is in the range of 0.509–0.535 nm.49Therefore, their differences are in the range of 20–26%, which are believed to be too large to expect an epitaxial relation between them. Schenk examined the texture of 30 nm-thick Si-doped HfO2 thin film and TiN electrode in his dissertation, and reported that the strongest texture is only three multiples of random distribution for both Si-doped HfO2 and TiN.44There might be an orientation relationship, but this relationship is not believed to be of a prototypical epitaxial type that gives rise to a certain strain in a specific crystallographic direction that can be easily argued to promote or inhibit the polar character of the poly-morphs of doped HfO2 thin films as in epitaxial films. There-fore, the epitaxial stress effect from TiN electrodes is not considered in this work.From the locations of the o111 and o002 peaks, d111 and d002 can be calculated.

Since the monoclinic phase possesses clearly distinguishable GIXRD patterns, quantitative analysis of its structure has been successfully conducted in literature.6In this study, the struc-tural changes observed during the phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal phase are intensively studied. The lattice parameters obtained for Gd-doped HfO2 thin films from GIXRD patterns were slightly smaller than those for the ortho-rhombic phase measured using STEM in a previous study.25 However, it should be noted that the lattice parameters taken from GIXRD patterns are averages of lattice parameters of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, whereas the lattice para-meters of specific crystalline phase in nanoscale grains can be measured using STEM.25As expected from Fig. 4b, the shorter axis of Gd:HfO2 films are generally larger than those of Si- and Al-doped HfO2 films, and the length of the shorter axis is generally found to increase with dopant size.

The methodology used in this study provides a framework for studying the newly reported nanoscale fluorite ferroelectrics. Although the HfO2 thin films doped with Si, Al, and Gd were studied here, this structural analysis is believed to be widely applicable even to the fluorite ferroelectrics with different matrix and dopant materials.The largest Pr and orthorhombic phase fraction can be observed within the cycle ratio range of 3–4.2 CR%, which is believed to be the doping concentration range of 1–3 cat% for all three dopants. The ALD cycle ratio region for ferroelectric properties was the narrowest for Si-doped HfO2, and increased with increasing dopant size. This can be qualitatively under-stood based on a metal–oxygen bond length model. The shorter Hf–O bond length in the tetragonal phase is much smaller than in the orthorhombic phase. Therefore, Si doping might decrease the relative free energy of tetragonal phase more significantly compared to the orthorhombic phase. This effect may become weaker with increasing dopant size.J.

V C 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4922272]Already, since the mid-19th century, HfO2 and ZrO2 have experienced intense study and research activities as a ce-ramic material. Only in the last decade, however, they have been rediscovered as a dielectric layer for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) applications, triggering enormous development activities in the field of thin film depo-sition. Whereas the research of the HfO2 and ZrO2 based ceramics was primarily aimed for toughening the material,1in CMOS application, the stabilization of a higher-k phase as suitable replacement for the no longer scaling gate or node dielectrics was focused on.2,3Nevertheless, during both research periods, one of the prior interests was the investiga-tion and control of the polymorphism of these transition metal oxides. In the HfO2 bulk system, three different crystal phases can be distinguished at normal pressure. At room temperature a monoclinic phase, above 1700�C a tetragonal phase, and above 2600�C a cubic phase can be observed.4However, in the course of the aforementioned research on bulk ceramics and CMOS-compatible dielectric thin films, several material and process parameters besides temperature were identified to influence crystalline phase stability in HfO2 systems. The sta-bilization of the high temperature phases at room temperature was found to depend on doping,5,6thermal treatments,7–9dep-osition methodology/chemistry, and growth temperature,10,11 surface energy effects and strain given by grain size and film thickness,8,9as well as on the mechanical encapsulation pro-vided by the electrodes.12 In 2011, B€oscke et al.13revealed deviations from the previously mentioned and commonly known polymorphism of HfO2. During this study of silicon doped HfO2, a non-centrosymmetric, orthorhombic phase was observed. This orthorhombic phase was first postulated and identified in ZrO2 by Kisi et al.14in 1989. Based on this non-centrosymmetric structure, two stable states in the unit cell can be switched by an external electric field. Therewith, aCMOS compatible, highly scalable, and manufacturable HfO2 based ferroelectric material has been established, sig-nificantly expanding the material choice for ferroelectric CMOS devices15and non-volatile memories like ferroelec-tric field effect transistors (FeFET) or the capacitor based ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM).16 Since the first discovery of ferroelectric behavior in sili-con doped HfO2, several dopants have been identified to evoke ferroelectricity in a similar manner.17,18However, de-spite the numerous parameters affecting phase stability in HfO2, so far no other pathways besides doping to achieve fer-roelectric phase stability have been reported. In this letter, we present",711
Muller_6nm_undoped_HfO2_APL_2015.docx,experiment,"al proof that depending on film thickness/ grain size and the adjustment of thermal budget a ferroelectric phase in HfO2 can be achieved without the utilization of a dopant.For this study, MIM capacitors were prepared with a 10 nm TiN bottom electrode deposited by thermal atomic layer deposition at 450�C, utilizing titan(IV)-chlorid (TiCl4) and ammonia (NH3). The HfO2 layers were deposited in a thickness range of 4–20 nm using an ALD hot wall reactor at 300�C. Hafnium(IV)-chlorid (HfCl4) and water (H2O) were used as precursor and oxidant. All samples were covered with a 10 nm physical vapor deposited (PVD) top electrode at a process temperature below the crystallization tempera-ture of the HfO2 films. In comparison to previous",186

A rapid thermal spike process at 650�C was utilized after top electrode deposition to crystal-lize the HfO2 layers. To achieve lowest thermal stress, a heating rate of 250 K s�1and a maximum cooling rate were applied. For the electrical characterization of the MIM layer stack, individual capacitor structures were formed using simple wet etch processes. For this purpose, 5 nm titanium0003-6951/2015/106(23)/232905/5/$30.00106, 232905-1V C 2015 AIP Publishing LLC232905-2P. Polakowski and J. M€ullerAppl. Phys. Lett. 106, 232905 (2015)adhesion layer and 50 nm platinum were deposited in an electron beam evaporator using a shadow mask. The result-ing circular probing pads served as etch mask during the wet etch process of the TiN based top electrode. As etch chemis-try for the selective removal of the top TiN, a solution of H2O:H2O2:NH4OH (SC1) was used in a ratio of 40:2:1 at 50�C for an etch time of 5 min. A Bruker D8 Discover X-Ray diffraction (XRD) system was used for the grazing incidence XRD scans of the samples to determine the crystal-lographic phase composition of the films. The polarization-voltage (P-V) hysteresis and cycling endurance measurements were conducted using an aixACCT TF Analyzer 3000 mea-surement setup, and the small signal capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics were recorded with an Agilent E4980A LCR-Meter. All P-V measurements were performed with a tri-angular voltage sweep at a frequency of 1 kHz. C-V hysteresis was measured at a frequency of 30 kHz with a superimposed small signal amplitude of 50 mV. For a consistent comparison of the hysteresis loops, all samples were pre-cycled electri-cally. This conditioning was found to be necessary to “wake up” the full polarization response and is frequently observed in the doped HfO2 systems as well as in other ferroelectrics.19 Hence, all samples, except the 20 nm samples, received 10 k switching cycles at 10kHz with an amplitude of 2.5 MV cm�1. Due to a higher leakage current, the cycling amplitude for the 20 nm sample was reduced to 1.5 MV cm�1. The higher leakage level is related to a premature and partial crys-tallization of the 20 nm film during the deposition process. Crystallization during the deposition process affects the roughness of the film and causes therewith a higher defect density as well as a higher monoclinic phase fraction.20,21 In order to implement HfO2 based ferroelectrics into future memories or CMOS devices, the influencing parame-ters of ferroelectric phase stability have to be identified. Besides numerous studies concerned with the effect of various dopants on the ferroelectric properties, little is known about secondary parameters such as HfO2 film thickness, deposition temperature, or the influence of the thermal budget during electrode formation. However, it should be noted that already in the pioneering work by B€oscke et al.,13the covering TiN top electrode as well as the film thickness was hinted to play a key role in the stabilization process of ferroelectric HfO2. Therefore, in a first attempt, we investigated the influence of the top electrode process, which directly followed the ALD of a 10 nm undoped HfO2 film. In order to reduce the thermal budget during top electrode formation to a minimum, a PVD TiN deposited at room temperature was utilized. For a consist-ent comparison to prior art, an identical prepared HfO2 film was coated with the usually utilized CVD-TiN top electrode at 500�C.

The different top electrode processes showed a strong influence on the occur-rence of ferroelectric properties in the resulting MIM capaci-tors. A distinct ferroelectric P-V hysteresis can be observed for the PVD-capped sample, whereas the CVD-capped sample shows a linear capacitance behavior and therewith a non-ferroelectric response. This difference is similarly reflected in the GIXRD",98

The latter system shows structural as well as electrical indications of a partial ferroelectric phase stabilization.can be observed for the PVD capped sample, as compared to the CVD capped sample.In order to explain the observed phenomena in the con-text of the non-ferroelectric, pure HfO2 in prior art, the crystallization temperature of the HfO2 thin films has to be considered. Utilizing a PVD-TiN top electrode deposited at room temperature allows for an encapsulation of the films in an amorphous state. Therewith, a premature crystalliza-tion of the HfO2 layer during the top electrode deposition can be avoided and a defined crystallization anneal via RTP can be conducted in a fully encapsulated state. During the CVD-TiN process at 500�C, on the other hand, a crystalli-zation of the HfO2 layers occurs. In this context, the CVD process can be interpreted as a long post deposition anneal of the HfO2 thin films, which does not allow the quenching of metastable phases and causes the formation of a large monoclinic phase fraction. Additionally, the phase stabiliz-ing effect of an encapsulated crystallization, as described in Refs. 12 and 13 is not accessed due to the premature crys-tallization. Consequently, a distinct ferroelectric behavior in undoped HfO2 utilizing a TiN encapsulation above crys-tallization temperature has never been observed. The addi-tional phase stabilizing effect of the TiN encapsulation observed in the doped HfO2 systems using CVD-TiN elec-trodeswastherewithsupportedbythesimultaneousincrease in crystallization temperature induced by the dopant. This raised crystallization temperature is frequently observed in doped HfO2 and ZrO2 based systems.8 However, a clear differentiation has to be made between the effect of dopants on the one side and the effect of thick-ness controlled grain size and encapsulation on the other side. As shown in literature for the doped systems and as these",570

We therefore argue that the appearance of ferroelectricity in pure HfO2 is intrinsic in nature and that a previous report by Olsen et al.,22showing the first indications of ferroelec-tricity in pure HfO2 in completely sputtered TiN/HfO2/TiN232905-3P.

The inset shows an enlargement of the prominent reflexes for the monoclinic, orthorhombic, and cubic phase structure, which were used for the calculation of the monoclinic phase fraction. (b) Calculated monoclinic phase fraction and corresponding values of remanent polarization Pr as a function of film thickness. Suppression of the monoclinic phase and stabilization of a ferroelectric phase is clearly observed.is not related to parasitic stabilization effects due to resid-ual contaminations.To further investigate the ferroelectric behavior in undoped HfO2, we deposited capacitors with different HfO2 thicknesses in a range of 4–20 nm. To confirm the crystalli-zation of the films and to investigate the crystal structure of the films, GIXRD measurements were conducted. As shown in Figure 2(a), a gradual destabilization of the presumably orthorhombic phase in favor of the monoclinic phase is observed with increasing thickness. The 4 nm sample stayed amorphous after the thermal treatment and will not be con-sidered further. All films below a thickness of 12 nm showeda low amount of the monoclinic phase and matched to the diffraction pattern of the orthorhombic phase. For the 20 nm film, the monoclinic crystal structure appeared as the pre-dominant phase. As proposed in Ref. 23, a monoclinic phase fraction was calculated to allow a quantification of the phase stabilization effect deemed responsible for the appearance of ferroelectricity in HfO2. Hence, as illustrated in the inset of Figure 2(a), the ratio of the integral intensities of the main reflexes of the monoclinic, and the presumably orthorhombic phase was calculated. The resulting monoclinic phase frac-tion is plotted (black line) as a function of film thicknesses in Figure 2(b), confirming the gradual increase of the mono-clinic phase towards higher film thicknesses.Furthermore, the corresponding remanent polarization values (blue line) are additionally shown in Figure 2(b). A strong correlation between a decreasing monoclinic phasefractionandenhancedferroelectricpropertiescanbeobserved. This increasing ferroelectric phase fraction with decreasing film thickness is further illustrated in the P-V-hysteresis loops (used for Pr extraction in Figure 2) and small signal capacitance measurements shown in Figure 3.The highest remanent polarization of 10.6 lC cm�2and the highest permittivity of approximately 34 were observed for the MIM-capacitor with an HfO2 thickness of 6 nm. Additionally, the non-linearity of the C-V behavior, which is characteristic for ferroelectric materials, was pronounced strongest in this sample. For the capacitors with 8 nm and 10 nm HfO2 thickness, a smaller but distinct polarization loop and C-V non-linearity was observed. For the 12 and 20 nm thick films, the permittivity significantly dropped to approximately 24 and approached the frequently observed <20 permittivity of the monoclinic phase.24For those sam-ples, a nearly linear C-V and P-V behavior was observed.In Figure 3(b), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs are shown for the 6 nm and the 20 nm thick HfO2 layers. Both layers exhibit a polycrystalline structure containing multiple grains. The grains are extending from the bottom to the top electrode without any additional hori-zontal interruption. Additionally, the lateral grain growth appears to be related to the vertical extension of the grains and therewith stays in the same order of magnitude.

Polakowski and J. M€ullerAppl. Phys. Lett. 106, 232905 (2015)linked. With this link, the surface to volume ratio of the crys-tallites and therewith phase stability can readily be influ-enced by a simple variation of film thickness. This phase stabilizing effect depending on the surface energy to bulk energy ratio of the individual crystal phases has extensively been discussed in the context of the HfO2 and ZrO2 polymor-phism.8,25A size induced monoclinic to tetragonal transition has been reported in powders26and thin films.20,27Hence, in the context of the data presented here, it appears likely that the grain sizes reduction with decreasing film thickness allows for a stabilization of the ferroelectric phase in a simi-lar manner and is comparable to the findings in the HfO2-ZrO2 solid solution.28As a consequence, it can be assumed that the surface energy of the orthorhombic phase is lower than the surface energy of the monoclinic phase. Supportive of this argumentation is a recent ab initio study by Materlik et al.29introducing surface energy effects as a key parameter in the stabilization effect of ferroelectric HfO2 and predicting the appearance of ferroelectricity in ultra-thin films of theAfterwards, a series of rectangular pulses at various stress levels was applied with a cycling frequency of 10 kHz (inset of Figure 4). With this voltage cycling, a continuous read/write memory operation of the ferroelectric capacitor was emulated.

When low-ering the stress amplitude to 2.1 MV cm�1, a sub-loop operation of the ferroelectric HfO2 and polarization fatigue was observed.

Electronic mail: akersch@hm.educonstant. M€uller11showed that ZrO2 behaves antiferroelec-tric: above a critical field in the order of 1 MV/cm, a temper-ature dependent field induced phase transformation to the f-phase occurs. A recent review of the current status of HfO2, ZrO2, and HZO based ferroelectric films can be found in Ref. 10.Although the ferroelectricity in binary oxides is similar to perovskites, there are some differences which make these materials highly attractive for technological applications: the binary oxides do not suffer from a dead layer effect which makes perovskites ineffective for thin film technology. The mid range dielectric constant8of the binary oxides allows switching at moderate voltage, although the necessary field strength required for polarization reversal is much higher than for perovskites.14The large field strength withoutbreakdown is possible due to the large band gap of 5.6 eVcompared to 3–5 eV in perovskites.15 Despite intense research in the last years to collect phe-nomenological knowledge and explore the fundamental effects, an open issue remains which is of some relevance forthe fundamental understanding as well as for the technologicalapplications: what is the exact reason for the stability of theferroelectric phase in the various conditions where it has beenfound? As a fact, the bulk materials have not been stabilized in the ferroelectric f-phase so far, whereas the possible influ-encing factors on phase stability like temperature, doping and other defects, stress or strain, and surface or interface energy are known. It is under intensive investigation what specific set of circumstances is responsible for the existence of the experi-mental observed ferroelectric thin films.The effect of doping to promote cubic Fm-3m (c-phase) or tetragonal P42/nmc (t-phase) phases is well known from partially and fully stabilized ceramics. The ferroelectric0021-8979/2015/117(13)/134109/15/$30.00117, 134109-1V C 2015 AIP Publishing LLC134109-2Materlik, K€unneth, and KerschJ. Appl. Phys. 117, 134109 (2015)f-phase was originally discovered in Si doped HfO2.1So far all subsequently produced ferroelectric films were doped as well, with the exception of HZO films. However, to com-pletely explain f-phase stability, there is still a need for an additional mechanism since the ferroelectric properties typi-cally disappear in thick films and bulk materials.16In this pa-per, we want to focus on the binary mixed oxide Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 to minimize computational load otherwise necessary for cal-culations with dopants.Since the discovery of transformation toughening by Garvie,17the importance of stress effects causing the transi-tion of stabilized tetragonal into the monoclinic P21/c phase (m-phase) is well known in ZrO2. Asymmetric stress effects have also been discussed as an explanation for the appear-ance of ferroelectric ZrO2 grains in cubic stabilized ZrO2.18 Furthermore, stress effects in thin Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films have been used as a possible explanation of how a cap electrode affects the ferroelectric phase by M€uller11,19as well as film thickness causing film stress variation and appearance of a ferroelectric phase by Park.16 The effect of grain size on phase stability is well known from the work of Garvie17and has an important application in ZrO2 thin films contained in the high-k dielectric of DRAM capacitors. These ZrO2 films with grain size below 30 nm are typically in the t-phase and the involved surface energy relative to the m-phase was",991

This investigation was deepened in the systematic work by Park24who found a loss of ferroelectricity for films above 20 nm.In this paper, we investigate the stability of the f-phase with density functional calculations (DFT). Section II describes the computational setup. In Secs. III A–III C, the computed structures and total and free energies for various polymorphs are presented and compared with literature data. The phonon modes and the infrared (IR) spectra are com-II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODSAll calculations are performed using the ABINIT pack-age.25,26The exchange-correlation energy is computed with a local-density approximation using the Perdew-Wang parameterization. For Hf, we use a self made norm-conserving Troullier-Martin pseudopotential generated with the fhi98 generator27to achieve good values for the lattice constants. For Zr and O, we use well calibrated RRKJ norm-conserving pseudopotentials from the Opium pro-ject.31The levels Hf(5s,5p,5d,6s), Zr(4s,4p,4d,5s), and O(2s,2p) are treated as valence states with the following atomic valence configurations for the reference state: Hf(5s25p65d26s2), Zr(4s24p64d05s0), and O(2s22p4). For Hf, core radii of 1.3 a0, 1.8 a0, and 2.7 a0 (Bohr radii) are cho-sen to describe angular waves from s to d. For Zr, the cutoff radii were 1.58 a0, 1.73 a0, and 1.79 a0 whereas for the O pseudopotential, a cutoff radius of 1.50 a0 for both s and p waves is applied. We also adopted a separable form for the pseudopotentials treating the following angular momentum waves as local: s for Hf, f for Zr, and p for O. For Hf, a non-linear core correction of radius 1.05 a0 was used.28 The Brillouin zone is sampled using the Monkhorst-Pack29scheme with a 6 � 6 � 6 k-point grid for all 12 atomic phases and a 3 � 6 � 6 for the 24 atomic orthorhombic Pbca phase (o-phase). The cutoff energy Ecut of the plane-wave expansion was fixed at 30 Ha. For the calculation of the pho-non modes, a 2 � 2 � 2 q-point grid was calculated and inter-polated to a 30 � 30 � 30 grid.30Integration of the phonon density of states yields the free energy. All parameters were carefully tested for convergence. The acoustic sum rule was imposed.HZO cells are constructed by replacing 50% of Zr atoms in ZrO2 with Hf. There are two inequivalent possibilities to build such a cell, but the difference in total energy and other properties between both is negligible small. To save CPU time, we choose one (see SI,32Table SI) for our calculations.Berry phase calculations were performed under an incre-mentally increasing electric field to study the effect of an external electrical field on m-, t-, and f-phase cells. Structural relaxations are performed after each increase of 1 MV/cm in electric field strength.puted as well. Since absolute values for total energies in III.",889

Besides the difference of the lattice angle b, the main distinction between the m- and the f-phase is a polarization dependent displacement of the O1 atom in z-direction. The o-phase is closely related to the f-phase because the 24 atomic cell is composed of two oppositely polarized 12 atomic f-phase cells. Nonetheless, the cell vol-ume and lattice constants differ: the volume changes from 138.7 A˚ 3to 133.8 A˚ 3and the length of the polarization axis c from 5.27 A˚ to 5.06 A˚ . The",196

Strain and stress Gibbs energySince it has been established that temperature does not stabilize the f-phase alone, we now investigate stress effects for a possible stabilization mechanism.

Fig. 4(b) illustrates calculated values for a grain size of 30 nm. The surface effects lower the phase transformation pressure.The fact that the f-phase has only been observed in thin films suggests that the phase could be stabilized under aniso-tropic strain conditions determined from a fixed surface area and zero stress in the normal direction of the film. The stable phase under any strain constraint within the three strain planes xy, xz, and yz is the one with the lowest value of the Helmholtz free energy.61In principle, all combinations ofstrain energy of two phases. However, an energy crossover can only happen in spatial orientations of cells with a rough match of lattice constants. For our calculations of the energy crossover under strain, we have chosen the spatial orienta-tions of the 12 atomic cells as shown in Table I. The spatial orientation between the c- and t-phase is obvious, as is the spatial orientation between o- and f-phase. For the t-phase, the c-axis in the crystallographic [001] direction is the largest with 5.15 A˚ and conforms most easily to the a-axis in [100] direction of the f-phase of length 5.25 A˚ . The a- and b-direc-tions of length 5.06 A˚ conform to the b- and c-directions of the f-phase of length 5.04 A˚ and 5.06 A˚ . The remaining two possibilities of a match: transformation (a(t), c(t), b(t)) ! (b(f), a(f), c(f)) (choice in Table I) and c(f)and b(f)inverted are obviously equivalent. Therefore, a t ! f transformation requires only a moderate elongation of the c(t)-axis and no significant modification of the a(t)and b(t)axis and could be promoted with a strain in the xz- or yz-plane. Crucial is the strain energy of the m- and o-phase since these start with the lowest energy from the beginning. The relative orientation between the m- and t-phase has been widely discussed in the literature in context of transformation toughening. Our choice for m ! t in Table I corresponds to the findings of42,43(a(m), b(m), c(m)) ! (a(t), c(t), b(t)). An alternative ori-entation (a(m), b(m), c(m)) ! (a(t), b(t), c(t)) was favored by Luo et al.34while he was looking for the smallest transition barrier between the m- and t-phase. We have calculated the total energy DU for the xz- and yz-strain planes, and all phases for the chosen orientation. The values of the lattice constants and the corresponding cell areas A have been cho-sen by modifying the in plane stress. In equilibrium, the grains should then adopt the crystal phase with the minimum Helmholtz free energy. In Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), we show theFIG. 5.

Unfortunately, for such an orientation, the polarization direction is within the thin film plane. Therefore, the grains cannot be polarized by an external electric field perpendicular to the thin film plane and an existing polariza-tion cannot be detected.So far the strain was oriented in the x, y, and z directions only. Tipping the c-axis out of the plane so that a measurable polarization could remain was suggested by Park.16In Fig. 6, we have calculated how an angle of 45�affects the phase sta-bility by rotating the stress tensor around the x-axis. No dis-tinction between m-phase and m0-phase is necessary, since both orientations fall upon each other. A window of stability opens for the f-phase (compared to Fig. 5), but the crossover points to the m-phase are located at a corresponding stress of 8 GPa for HZO and 7 GPa for ZrO2. Based on the high corre-sponding stress values for crossover points indicated by our calculations, we conclude that the film stress is unlikely the most important factor to cause a phase stabilization of the f-phase with a metastable polarization along the directionThe remaining question is whether the calculations are consistent with the conditions of the first",312

As a conse-quence, an exposure of tetragonally stabilized ZrO2 with water could lead to a transformation back to the m-phase, an effect known as low-temperature degradation.64Finally, the surface energies have been measured in powder, whereas many appli-cations use nanocrystalline thin films with additional effects from interface energy. The essential observation in the size driven m ! t transformation in ZrO2 compared to HfO2 is that in HfO2 a much larger surface area to volume ratio is required. This implies a smaller difference between the surface energy of the m- and t-phase in HfO2 compared to ZrO2.Since our question concerns the stability of the f-phase we need values for the surface energy of all the competingTABLE V.

Nonetheless, we need values for the composition depend-ence, since the ferroelectric phase is observed in HZO. We chose the missing values as model parameters. The choice has been guided by the existing data, most importantly by the smaller difference of c (m-HfO2) and c (t-HfO2) com-pared to c (m-ZrO2) and c (t-ZrO2).

As a first possible mechanism to stabilize the ferroelectric phase we investigated the film strain. Although we could reproduce all relevant stress and strain dependent phenomena in HfO2 and ZrO2 with our model, we onlyfound a small window of rather high compressive film strainto allow a stabilization of the ferroelectric phase. Since the thus stabilized structure has a polarization in the strain plane, which is unobservable, we found the stress/strain mechanism unlikely to be the major cause of the stabilization. As a sec-ond possible mechanism, we investigated the surface energy contribution to the Helmholtz free energy. Since the surface energy of ferroelectric grains has not been measured or cal-culated so far we build a phenomenological model for all polymorphs and all stoichiometry values by interpolating between existing values using decreasing values for increas-ing crystal symmetry.

Kisung manuscript-HZO_phase_stability.docx,Abstract,"Hafnium-zirconium oxide (HZO) thin films are of interest due to their ability to form ferroelectric (FE) and antiferroelectric (AFE) oxides. Density functional theory is employed to elucidate the stabilization mechanisms of the FE HZO thin films and the stabilization mechanisms for ZrO2 AFE films. The FE orthorhombic phase is primarily stabilized by in-plane tensile strain, which spontaneously occurs during the synthesis process, and this is more effective for HZO than HfO2. Stack models of the polymorphs of the HZO and ZrO2 reveal that the electrostatic component of interfacial free energy can play a critical role to understand prevalent formation of ZrO2 AFE tetragonal phase and the “wake-up” effect for FE HZO.",182
Kisung manuscript-HZO_phase_stability.docx,Introduction,"The demonstration of ferroelectricity shown in hafnium oxide (HfO2)-base thin films such as Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) and doped HfO2 [1], [2] has triggered intense research efforts because they may be a key component for next-generation electronic devices such as negative capacitance field effect transistors [3] and ferroelectric (FE) memories [4]. HZO films show large band gaps, high dielectric constants, and robust ferroelectric behavior in films with a thickness of ~10 nm [1], [2]. HZO is considered especially promising compared to doped HfO2 since there is a broad process window that induces FE behavior in HZO [5]. It is generally accepted that an orthorhombic Pca21 phase is responsible for the observed ferroelectricity in HZO thin films [1], [2]. It is a metastable phase in bulk films since the formation energy is ~70 meV per formula unit (fu) higher than the ground state of monoclinic P21/c phase according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations (see Figure 1). A number of factors have been suggested to stabilize the ferroelectricity of the HZO film in thin films such as thickness and composition of the film as well as the top/bottom electrode materials [1], [2], [6]–[8]. Thinner films with a composition close to 50% Hf and 50% Zr tend to favor ferroelectricity [6]. In addition, ferroelectricity is favored for HZO films grown on specific electrode materials. Titanium nitride (TiN) [6], [7] and tungsten (W) [9] are well-known to favor the ferroelectricity in HZO while Pt electrodes cannot form ferroelectric HZO [10]. In contrast to the inert Pt electrode, both TiN and W are known to form strong interfacial bonding with HZO, which is a key factor for inducing ferroelectricity in HZO.While some of these factors are recognized as important by various research groups, most of the theoretical predictions based on DFT calculations argue that compressive strain be responsible for stabilization of the orthorhombic phase over the monoclinic phase [11], [12]. However,",511
Kisung manuscript-HZO_phase_stability.docx,experiment,"al studies often report the ferroelectric HZO {111} films have tensile stress [13]. For instance, Batra et al. show in their DFT calculations that compressive strain with external electric field can stabilize the orthorhombic phase both in hydrostatic and in-plane along (001) stress conditions [11]. Similarly, Liu and Hanrahan also show the effects of in-plane strains for {100}, {110} and {111}, arguing that ferroelectricity can be stabilized either by in-plane compression in those surfaces or by an external electric field [12]. These calculations are correct, but a separate mechanism must be present to explain the",139

In addition, nanocrystalline HfO2 and ZrO2 in a SiO2 dielectric matrix are known to be tetragonal even in thick films (i.e., 200-700 nm) consistent again with favorable interfacial free energy [16], but such effects have not been validated by DFT calculations. Only a few DFT calculations can be found recently to take into the HZO with interfaces. For instance, Blaise has demonstrated a metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitor model of TiN/Si-doped HfO2/TiN in DFT calculations, and quantitatively estimated the depolarization field of 2.5 MV/cm [17], which agrees with",184
Kisung manuscript-HZO_phase_stability.docx,experiment,"s.In this letter, the two key observations described above are given an atomistic mechanism using DFT models. First, by carefully examining the crystal structures of various polymorphs in HZO, two distinct planes of the monoclinic phase have been identified, one of which shows higher surface atomic density than the FE phase and is observed",72
Kisung manuscript-HZO_phase_stability.docx,experiment,"ally on common electrodes. Crystallization of amorphous HZO on a strongly bound the electrodes, generates tension due to the crystalline phases having a higher density than the amorphous phase. During post-deposition crystallization of amorphous HZO, the resulting tension will favor formation of FE orthorhombic HZO compared to the high density plane of the monoclinic phase. Second, stack models show that a polarization perpendicular to the dielectric-ferroelectric interface has a high interfacial free energy consistent with nanocrystalline ZrO2 spontaneous forming the tetragonal phase and HZO commonly required electrical cycling for observation of strong ferroelectric behavior. Computational DetailsDFT calculations are performed as implemented in Vienna Ab initio Software Package [18], [19] to determine the stabilization mechanisms of HZO thin films. The plane-wave basis set of pseudopotentials are expanded up to a kinetic energy cut off of 400 eV. The projector augmented wave method is used for core part [20]. The exchange-correlation functional of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof is employed [21]. Kohn-Sham energy eigenvalues are integrated in reciprocal space on even grids generated by a Monkhorst-Pack scheme with density of 0.25 2π Å-1 [22]. Electronic structure self-consistent field is iterated until changes in each of the eigenvalues and the total energy are less than 10-4 meV. Atomic positions and lattice parameters are optimized by conjugate gradient until the Hellmann−Feynman forces acting on each atom became smaller than 1 meV/ Å. To impose in-plane strain along different orientations of the HZO such as {001}, {011} and {111}, the unit cell rotation was performed to orient one of the cell axis, i.e., c, along the planes of interest, which is similar to the previous study [12]. Isotropic change of the initial rotated cell area is imposed to generate in-plane strain. To model plane-stress condition, i.e., σ3=0, the cell parameter along that orientation is set free to relax while the other two cell parameters are fixed at their initial values. To model HZO in 1x1x1 cell containing four HfO2 formula units, two of the metal sites are occupied by Hf, while the rest two sites are occupied by Zr. All the possible configurations of HZO alloys are determined to be energetically degenerated within sub meV/fu limit for 1x1x1 cell, and the difference in energy is less than 2 meV/fu for doubled cells. Therefore, the most energetically stable configuration of the ordered HZO alloy is chosen for all of the calculations below.",608
Kisung manuscript-HZO_phase_stability.docx,Discussion,"Figure 1(a) shows various polymorphs of HZO. Derived from a cubic parent phase (fluorite), all the polymorphs show similar atomic arrangements; the metal ions (Hf/Zr) form a face-centered cubic framework with the O atoms occupying all of the tetrahedra sites. Each of the O atoms are displaced from the cubic symmetric positions and the polymorphs are identified by the specific arrangement of the O atoms as shown in Figure 1(a). Note that the Pca21 phase (ortho FE) represents a non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric phase with spontaneous dipoles as marked by blue arrows in Figure 1(a). However, the ortho FE phase is a metastable phase in a pure bulk state with its formation energy higher by ~60-80 meV/fu (ZrO2 to HfO2) than the ground state P21/c phase (mono) as seen in Figure 1(b). The Pbca phase (ortho AFE) show similar atomic arrangement as the ortho FE, but the displacements of O atoms are switched in every unit cell of the ortho FE inducing centrosymmetric phase. Figure 1(b) shows that the P42/mnc phase (tetra AFE) is ~65-93 meV/fu (ZrO2 to HfO2) higher in energy than the ortho FE in static DFT calculations (i.e., at 0 K), but it is known that the tetra AFE is the ground state at relatively high temperature [23], indicating that entropic contribution from phonons plays a role. Note that the tetra AFE does not show local dipole in contrast to the ortho AFE as shown in Figure 1(a), and it is known to",386
Kisung manuscript-HZO_phase_stability.docx,experiment,"ally exhibit paraelectric behavior for weak external electric fields [24], which is the middle part of the double hysteresis of the AFE. Once the external field is greater than the onset field, the tetragonal transforms into orthorhombic ferroelectric phase, as indicated by double hysteresis curve [24]. Understanding both unusual response to the external field and highly symmetric atomic arrangements similar to the ortho FE phase is the key to provide underlying mechanisms in this material system (to be discussed).Unlike the orthogonal phases, the mono phase has non-equivalent planes with (hkl) and (hk-l) indices where h, k and l are integers. The mono (01-1) show higher surface atom density than the mono (011) as shown in Figure 1(c). Similarly, mono (11-1) and mono (111) show higher and lower surface atom densities, respectively, than both tetra (111) and ortho FE (111) as in Figure 1(d). This is in agreement with splitting of the x-ray diffraction peaks (2θ) corresponding to tetra (111) or ortho (111) at ~30° into two separate peaks at ~28° and ~32° [23]. Note that the peak at ~28° corresponds to greater interplanar spacing (d) as well as higher surface atomic density according to the Bragg’s law (e.g., nλ=2dsinθ).",319

In general, as-deposited HZO grown by thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) forms an amorphous film, which is subsequently crystalized during thermal annealing over 400°C [1], [2], [25], [26]. It is hypothesized that reactive metal electrodes such as TiN and W, also help stabilize the FE films [10], which result in in-plane tension during the crystallization as the film is densified while maintaining strong bonding at the interfaces. It has been previously shown that FE HZO film sandwiched by TiN electrodes after annealing is under tension [13]. Therefore, identifying the distinct planes with different densities and taking into account the strong bond formations at the interface play a crucial role to explain properly the",180

The curve for amorphous phase, generated by melt-quench in ab initio molecular dynamics, is shown in all cases, confirming higher energy and surface area than the crystalline phases due to the disordered atomic arrangements. When the amorphous phase is crystallized with the strong bonds formed at the interface, it is hypothesized that the volume reduction due to the crystallization will result in in-plane tension, favoring the ortho AFE over the m phase first, and then the ortho FE phase with further strain. This is consistent with",115
Kisung manuscript-HZO_phase_stability.docx,experiment,"al data.The quantitative effect of tension is compared versus oxide composition. For pure HfO2, the ortho FE phase becomes more stable than the mono phase when 4.2% of in-plane tension is applied with respect to the minimum of the ortho FE, while the required strains to stabilize the ortho FE phase are as small as 2.9% and 2.7% for HZO and ZrO2, respectively. The lower amount of in-plane tension is required for the HZO than pure HfO2 to stabilize the ortho FE phase over the mono phase is consistent with",130
Kisung manuscript-HZO_phase_stability.docx,results,"showing that the ferroelectricity is the most stable for HZO [6]. While the pure ZrO2 shows the least amount of in-plane tension needed to stabilize the ferroelectricity, it is known that amorphous formation is hindered for ZrO2 since it grows in a nanocrystalline phase instead of in a purely amorphous phase due to the low crystallization temperature [15]. It has been shown that inserting interfacial HfO2 layers between the electrode and ZrO2, which would direct the growth of ZrO2 into a greater crystal size, enhances the ferroelectricity [27]. As shown in the Figure 1(b), the tetragonal phase is relatively more stable for ZrO2 (65 meV above the minimum of the ortho FE) than either HZO or HfO2 (74 and 93 meV/fu) which is consistent the easier formation of tetragonal phase over orthorhombic FE.In the absence of external field, the amount of tension needed to stabilize the orthorhombic FE phase over the orthorhombic AFE phase seems similar for all the compositions (5.3-5.5%). However, it has been theoretically shown that external electric field can further stabilize the orthorhombic FE over the orthorhombic AFE [11], [12]. This suggests that the necessity of external field cycling on the as-annealed films to invoke the ferroelectricity which is known as “wake-up” process since ortho AFE will become unstable in the presence of external field.Figure 3 shows the energy-area curves for biaxial strain perpendicular to the {011} orientation. According to the hypothesis that strong bonding formed at the electrode interface favors the high density planes, the high density plane, i.e., (01-1), of the monoclinic phase is shown in Figure 1(b). It is noted that proper choice of substrate for epitaxial growth by molecular beam epitaxy technique can also be used to favor (01-1), of the monoclinic phase. In this case, the ortho FE phase is the most stable at its minimum for all the compositions, indicating no in-plane strain is necessary to stabilize the ferroelectricity. This implies that ferroelectric films can be prepared by different methods than thermal ALD and annealing. In fact, Shimizu et al. have demonstrated the ferroelectricity in epitaxially grown (011) yttrium- (Y-) doped HfO2 on top of Y-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) by using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [28], which is consistent with the present DFT calculations in Figure 3. The amount of tension to stabilize the ortho FE over ortho AFE ranges 3.2-3.8%, which is even smaller than that for {111} orientation. This indicates that the “wake-up” process can be reduced compared to the {111} growth. In contrast to {111} and {011}, the HZO films along {001} cannot be stabilized either by mechanical strain or epitaxial growth since the monoclinic phase always shows lower energy than the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase in a wide range of in-plane strain as seen in Figure S1. Shimizu et al. have grown an epitaxial film of (001) Y-doped HfO2 on (001) YSZ by using PLD, of which the phase is progressively varied with Y content from monoclinic to orthorhombic to tetragonal [29]. As lattice parameters of Y-doped HfO2 and YSZ are sufficiently close to each other, the tetragonal/orthorhombic phases in these films are stabilized by other mechanisms than mechanical strain.To further elucidate the observed FE behavior of HZO and the AFE behavior of nanocrystalline ZrO2 films, stack models with domain boundaries of the tetra and ortho FE phases are constructed for ZrO2 in Figures 4(a-d) and other compositions in Figure S2. Atomically sharp domain boundaries without a defect within a single grain are built based on the recent",925
Kisung manuscript-HZO_phase_stability.docx,experiment,"al report [30]. Each model is constructed based on the dipole orientations in ortho FE layers with a varying thickness, and the volume of each phase is set at the bulk ortho FE phase. The interface free energy (Einter) is calculated bywhere Estack is the total energy of the stack. Etetra and Eortho are energies in bulk state for tetragonal AFE and orthorhombic FE phases, respectively, with the unit cell volume fixed at ortho FE. The n and A are tetra/ortho layer thickness and cross-sectional area, respectively. Figure 4(e) shows that the Einter converges with increasing n in all cases. Moreover, the stack with dipole direction perpendicular to the interface (i.e., along z) shows the highest Einter, which is expected to be due to the electrostatic interactions. This is consistent with the negative capacitance models of Khan et al. showing that perpendicular polarization is destabilized by having a paraelectric in series with ferroelectric HZO [31]. The field due to the spontaneous polarization in the ferroelectric orthorhombic region induces the neighboring dielectric layer polarized, which will increase the energy of the system. It is observed that unconstrained stack models spontaneously transform into other phases or change its polarization direction from perpendicular to parallel to the interface. Based on a kinetic model proposed previously [26], the tetra phase would form first during the thermal annealing, which is subsequently transformed into the ortho FE phase. By using internal energy change (ΔU=Etetra – Eortho) and interfacial free energies (ES) obtained from the stack models as shown in Figure 4(e), the energy of ortho-tetra phase transition within a 3D tetra matrix (ΔE) is estimated as a function of the orthorhombic nanocrystal size (m) which is depicted in Figure 4(f):where the subscript S in the second term runs all six interfaces. Here, m x m x m orthorhombic nanocrystal is assumed to form within the tetragonal matrix for simplicity although asymmetric precipitates are known to form within cubic/tetragonal matrix consistent with the anisotropic Einter [32]. Figure 4(g) shows that the interfacial energy dominates for small-sized crystals, indicated by negative ΔE, while the ΔU term starts to dominate for large crystals when m (the length of the nanocrystallytes) reaches ~10, which corresponds to crystal with a length of 5 nm and a volume of 125 nm3.

Kisung manuscript-HZO_phase_stability.docx,experiment,"ally observed formation of the AFE tetragonal ZrO2 in a paraelectric matrix [15], [16], the interface effects are explicitly taken into account in three-dimensional (3D) DFT models of ferroelectric orthorhombic and tetragonal cores embedded within cubic matrix as illustrated in Figure 5(a). The cubic phase is employed as the matrix due to its high symmetry, and it serves as a paraelectric medium. Note in a real materials, this could be amorphous ZrO2 or SiO2 in grain boundaries and amorphous interlayers on the electrode surfaces [15], [16]. Unlike the stack models in Figure 4, in which interface is made along one direction, the dipole in the ferroelectric core is always pointing to the interfaces in the 3D models. Therefore, the unfavorable interactions at the FE/DE interface cannot be avoided; therefore, the core of orthorhombic ferroelectric is transformed into the tetragonal phase despite its higher ΔU as seen in Figure 1(b). All the O atoms in the 3D models were fixed at their ideal positions of the corresponding phases to prevent the models in Figure 5 from converting to a single phase.Figure 5(b) shows that the tetragonal cores are significantly lower in energy compared to the orthorhombic core due to the interfacial free energy. Mechanical strain did not influence significantly in this case as shown in Figure S3. The effect of having a AFE tetragonal vs FE orthorhombic core is profound; the AFE tetragonal core is more stable than the FE orthorhombic core by ~195-210 meV/fu despite the bulk AFE tetragonal phase being less stable than the FE orthorhombic phase by 60-90 meV/fu as seen in Figure 1(b). The ΔE is the lowest for the pure ZrO2 partly due to the smaller energy difference compared to HfO2 and HZO between the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases as in Figure 1(b), which is consistent with the",450

In the presence of external field, however, the ferroelectric phase would be stabilized compared to the non-polar phases as shown previously [11], [12]. This field-aided stabilization of the ferroelectric phase is consistent with the FE HZO film synthesis in general that “wake-up” is necessary to obtain FE behavior.",155
Kisung manuscript-HZO_phase_stability.docx,Conclusion,"sDensity functional theory calculations were employed to address two major questions on the phase stabilizations for hafnium-zirconium oxide thin films. First, stabilization of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase is enabled by in-plane tensile strain if the amorphous film is deposited on top of the reactive metal electrodes, and is subsequently crystallized by post-deposition annealing. Second, interfacial free energy plays a crucial role to stabilize antiferroelectric tetragonal phase and is consistent with the need for electrical cycling for observation of ferroelectric behavior.",124

The negative values mean the tetragonal core is more stable than the orthorhombic core due to the presence of the paraelectric matrix.

This method has beenstudied for achieving the higher-k value of HfO2 16,17 as well as enhancing the toughness of ZrO2.18In particular, Yttria-Ferroelectric HfO2 was demonstrated by incorporating various cation dopants (Si,7,8Y,22Sc,12Al,23Zr,24Gd,25and alkaline earth metals26) into HfO2. Recently, it was reported that anion (N) incorporation could stabilize the HfO2 ferro-electric phase as well.12However, it is still not well under-stood why so many dopants can drive the ferroelectricity in HfO2. Schroeder and coworkers considered the role of dop-ants from the dopant size, and suggested that only small size dopants (the dopant radius is smaller than the Hf one) show a stable pinched P–E hysteresis (antiferroelectric like shape) with the increase of the doping concentration.27On the other hand, it is often discussed that the Vo formation can cause HfO2 structural transformation to a higher symmetry (e.g., the M phase to the T/C phase),28,29and that Vo might stabi-lize the ferroelectric O phase at the M�T/C phase transition boundary. Therefore, it is inferred that both the dopant size and the Vo formation are responsible for the ferroelectric phase stabilization in HfO2. Thus, the objective of this study is twofold. One is to quantitatively assess the dopant size effect and the Vo formation effect on ferroelectric HfO2 phase stabilization. We first clarify what the differences are between the dopant size effect and the Vo formation effect, by systematically investigating various cation (Sc, Y, Nb, Al, Si, Ge, and Zr) and anion (N) dopants. The other one is to elucidate a common origin behind the dopant size effect and the Vo formation effect.

It is noted that, in Fig. 5(a), Sc (Y) doping drives the HfO2 phase transition to the O/T/C phase, while Nb doping favors stabi-lizing the M phase. In the Zr doping case, the monoclinic phase fraction does not change so much. Since Sc3þ(75 pm), Zr4þ(72 pm), and Nb5þ(64 pm) have a similar ionic radius to Hf4þ(71 pm) with the coordination number of 6,32the dif-ference in these rM�dop% plots is unlikely to be due to the dopant size difference.

Toriumi_doped_HfO2_FE_JAP_2017.docx,results,"from the various valence states of dopants.On the other hand, in Fig. 5(b), the tetravalent dopants [Zr4þ(72 pm), Ge4þ(53 pm), and Si4þ(40 pm) with the coordination number of 6]32present a clear size-dependent effect on the HfO2 phase transition. Si incorporation shows a much stronger effect than Ge or Zr incorporation, which sug-gests that a smaller dopant can stabilize the O/T/C phase in HfO2 more efficiently. For Si or Ge doping, it is inferred that the shorter cation-oxygen bonding (e.g., Si-O and Ge-O) favors the tetragonal structure, in which each Hf atom has four shorter and four longer Hf-O bonds.33,34But in the cubic structure, eight Hf-O bonds have the same length, and thus the cubic phase is hard to be stabilized by Si or Ge dop-ing.33,34In addition, since the energy difference between the T phase and the ferroelectric O phase was estimated to be very small,10,35it is possible that the structural transition between these two phases may be driven by an external elec-tric field.10,35The antiferroelectric like behaviors are clearly observed in Ge- and Si-doped HfO2, as shown in Figs. 2(d), 2(g) and 2(h), which might be owing to the electric field induced reversible phase transition between the T phase and the ferroelectric O phase. On the contrary, the antiferroelec-tric behavior is not clearly observed in N-, Sc-, and Y-doped HfO2 films. It is possibly due to the fact that the stabilized phase (in the over-doping region) is the cubic phase rather than the tetragonal phase in N-, Sc-, and Y-doped HfO2 films. It is worthwhile to mention that Ge diffusion from the substrate into HfO2 was very weak (<0.03% Ge, confirmed by the SIMS profile of annealed non-doped HfO2).12 Next, the dopant-induced HfO2 ferroelectric transition is 0.34% N incorporation can drive the maximum ferroelectric-further discussed. As shown in Fig. 6, the Psw � dop% plot, ity in HfO2, and 0.7% doping concentration is needed for Si, Y, or Sc incorporation. For Ge or Zr doping, a much higher doping concentration is required. This tendency is the same as that in the dopant-induced HfO2 phase transition shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). It is noted that another interesting point is that the maximum PSW is 22 (62) lC/cm2for all dopants used in this study.Here, we notice the different dopant sensitivities in Fig. 6. Although both dopant size and Vo formation effects seemFIG. 6.

Phys. 122, 124104 (2017)to contribute differently to the ferroelectric phase formation in HfO2, the Psw � dop% relationship looks like the same for all dopants in shape. This fact suggests that a same origin responsible for the ferroelectric phase formation may work in both Vo and dopant size effects.

Then, based on the Eq.

In the case of Al doping, the measured Al doping concentration (very small, dop% < 1.0% for maximum PSW) has a large error bar owing to the small Al peak sensitivity in XPS.124104-6Xu et al.J. Appl. Phys. 122, 124104 (2017)these HfO2 films. In the case of slight doping, PSW is larger than 15 lC/cm2even though the O/T/C phase fraction is only 50%, and thus the ferroelectric O phase is expected to be the dominant one in O/T/C phases. By further increasing the dopant concentration, the T/C phase will become the dominant one, and as a result, the ferroelectricity is strongly suppressed in heavily doped HfO2 (the O/T/C phase ratio reaches 100%). Here, Zr doping is not included, because Zr-doped HfO2 cannot be regarded as a diluted HfO2 system.Moreover, structural properties of doped HfO2 are dis-cussed in Fig. 9, in which the O/T/C (111) peak position is shown as a function of the M phase fraction. By increasing the doping concentration, the 2h peak position shifts from 30.40�to 30.65�. From this result, it is concluded that�30.40�and �30.65�are probably responsible for the ferro-electric O phase and the T/C phase, respectively. It is consis-tent with the lattice constants calculated for the ferroelectric O phase (5.02 � 5.04 � 5.22 A˚ , 2h ¼ 30.39�),10T phase (5.03� 5.03 � 5.12 A˚ , 2h ¼ 30.58�),10and C phase (5.03 � 5.03� 5.03 A˚ , 2h ¼ 30.76�),10respectively. Figure 9 also suggests that the dopant-induced structural transformation in HfO2 is independent of dopant species as long as that the doped HfO2 could be regarded as a diluted system. Nevertheless, it is not easy to judge the crystalline structure only by XRD, and fur-ther microscopic study will be needed, for example, with the electron beam diffraction analysis.Finally, the phase transition route is discussed. The unique transition route in Fig. 8 is understandable by consid-ering that the kinetic pathway of the dopant-induced HfO2 phase transition along the T/C, ferroelectric O, and M phases may be the same. It is noted that the ferroelectric O phase can be stabilized at the transition boundary between the M phase and the T/C phase. This means that the ferroelectric O phase seems to be an intermediate phase. At the T–M phase transition, the T–O phase transition might be the first step, followed by the O–M phase transition. Namely, the stabiliza-tion of the ferroelectric O phase is much more related to the phase transition kinetics rather than its thermodynamics. TheFIG. 9. The O/T/C (111) peak positions are shown as a function of the monoclinic phase fraction for various dopants. The red and green arrows represent the theoretical values for the ferroelectric O phase and the T phase in Ref. 10, respectively. The blue arrow is the universal phase transitionphase transition (e.g., T–M) can be driven by the free energy difference (DGc) between the parent phase and the product phase. But considering the kinetic process, an intermediate phase (metastable) might be formed first for lowering the activation energy between the parent phase and the product phase. The activation energy is related to both the strain energy (DUstrain) and the interface energy (DUinterface, an excess energy at the interface between the parent phase and the product phase).35Unlike the T–M phase transition which is accompanied by a large volume expansion (DV � 5.9%) and shape strain (dominated by a shear stain, c � 0.15), the volume increase (DV � 2.0%) and shape strain (dominated by a dilatational strain, n � 0.02) are much smaller in the T–O phase transition.35,36Therefore, from the viewpoint of the kinetic transition process, the strain condition (related to DUstrain) and grain size (related to DUinterface) are critically important for stabilizing the ferroelectric O phase in HfO2.",1063
Toriumi_doped_HfO2_FE_JAP_2017.docx,CONCLUSION,"SDopant-induced structural and ferroelectric transitions in HfO2 have been systematically studied by doping various cations (Sc, Y, Al, Nb, Si, Ge, Nb) and an anion (N) into HfO2. First, it has been found that the doping sensitivity is quantitatively quite different among various dopants for the HfO2 ferroelectric transition, while the maximum switching polarization value is almost the same. Both the Vo and dop-ant size effects are responsible for these different dopant sensitivity coefficients. Moreover, it is inferred that the dopant-induced HfO2 phase transition pathway is almost the same for all dopants. We consider it is more related to the kinetic process of the T–O–M phase transition, in which the ferroelectric O phase formation might significantly reduce the activation energy between the T phase and the M phase. From these findings, it is conjectured that the ferro-electric O phase might be in the intermediate state between the T phase and the M phase. With the dopant concentration increase, HfO2 crystalline symmetry changes from the lower to higher, and thus the intermediate orthorhombic phase may appear.

We found that capacitors manufactured with this scheme exhibited non-linearities in their capacitance-voltage behavior, which did not occur if crystallization was induced prior to capping (Fig. 1). A comprehensive characterization was made by electrical polarization measurements on capped HfSiO films at different compositions. A gradual transition from ferroelectric to antiferroelectric polarization curves is observed with increasing silicon content (Fig. 2), which is also reflected in small signal capacitance-voltage measurements. Further evidence for ferroelectric and antiferroelectric behavior was obtained by measurement of the mechanic displacement (Fig. 3). The ferroelectric sample shows clear evidence of degradation of data retention due to a high depolarization field piezoelectric behavior, which is a prerequisite for [5]. It becomes clear that a silicon compatible ferroelectric is a requirement for a reliable FeFET. As known from the search for high-k gate dielectrics, only very few metal oxides are stable in contact to silicon and exhibit a sufficient band offset at the same time [6]. One of them is the well known high-k dielectric HfO2, which has so far been only regarded as a paraelectric material. It has been reported [7,8], that the properties of HfO2, and consequently HfSiO, thin films can be influenced, if ferroelectricity [9]. A symmetric, electrostrictive, response is observed for the antiferroelectric sample. This confirms that the observed polarization loops are not caused by parasitic electronic effects, but are of microstructural origin.Since ferroelectricity is related to the crystal structure, a previously undetected crystalline phase must be present in the devices as prepared here. X-ray diffraction measurements (Fig. 4) of uncapped films show good agreement to a tetragonal/monoclinic-HfO2 mixture, as it is commonly 978-1-4577-0505-2/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE24.5.1IEDM11-547observed for crystalline thin films. Capped samples, however, show a difraction pattern indicating a significant fraction of orthorhombic-HfO2. The known forms of o-HfO2 (Space groups Pbca and Pbcm) are centrosymmetric and therefore not ferroelectric. Furthermore, they are usually only observed at programming bias for further evidence. Fig. 9 shows the programming behavior of devices at different compositions. A clear crossover from dipole switching for FE to charge trapping for AFE insulators is evident. The threshold voltage shift in FE devices was retained in extremely high pressure. However, a similar diffraction pattern unbiased state, allowing the non-volatile storage of has been reported [10] for a rare orthorhombic phase with space group Pbc21 in Mg-doped ZrO2, which emerged when the t→m transformation was inhibited by external stress in nano-scale crystallites. Similar conditions may arise in capped thin films of HfSiO (Fig. 5). Since the chemistry of ZrO2 is almost identical to that of HfO2, the same phases occur in both oxides. The Pbc21 space group is not centrosymmetric and does therefore not exclude ferroelectricity. A fuller account of our investigations of ferroelectric HfO2 has been published in the meantime [11,12,13,14]. information. Extrapolation to 10 years yields a memory window of 650 mV (Fig. 10), which suggests the viability of long-term data storage. We note that this is an exceptionally long retention time for a FEFET which usually suffer from retention time loss due to imperfect interfaces to silicon. To test the lateral scalability limits of this technology, we also manufactured short channel devices. Functional devices were observed down to 80 nm x 150 nm (WxL), the smallest structure on the mask set (Fig. 11, Fig. 7). Ferroelectric Field Effect Transistors",1032
Muller_Miko_Uwe_SiHfO2_FE_transistor_IEDM_2011.docx,Conclusion,"s The high bond strength of ferroelectric HfO2 sets it apart from common ferroelectrics in several aspects: The high band gap and bad offsets allow for low leakage current even for very thin films below 10 nm. The excellent thermodynamic stability allows a direct contact to silicon and silicon dioxide. No noble metal electrodes or buffer layers are required as in earlier concepts [3]. Transistors were manufactured in a gate first scheme with a gate stack consisting of 1.2 nm thermal SiO2 interface, 5-9 nm ferroelectric HfSiO insulator, and a TiN electrode. Crystallization of the HfSiO thin films was induced by a 1000 °C/20 s anneal in nitrogen after top electrode deposition. Both long and short channel devices were manufactured. Fig. 6 compares the behavior of devices with ferroelectric and with antiferroelectric gate insulators during gate voltage sweeps and separate program and sense steps. The We reported the formation of ferroelectric o-HfO2 in thin films and manufactured functional nano-scale FeFETs with promising electrical characteristics. Both lateral dimensions and dielectric thickness are at least an order of magnitude smaller than previously reported devices with conventional ferroelectrics (Fig. 12). Both the extraordinary reduction in size and the improvement in device characteristics are driven by the vastly superior material properties in this application and suggest the viability of nano-scale FeFET memory based on FE-HfO2.",349

Density functional theory calculations reveal the structure, formation energy, and total energy of various defects in HfO2. Most relevant are substitutional elec-tronically compensated defects without oxygen vacancy, substitutional mixed compensated defects paired with a vacancy, and ionically compensated defect complexes containing two substitutional dopants paired with a vacancy. The ferroelectric phase is strongly favored with La and Y in the substi-tutional defect. The mixed compensated defect favors the ferroelectric phase as well, but the strongly favored cubic phase limits the concentration range for ferroelectricity. We conclude that a reduction of oxygen vacancies should significantly enhance this range in Y doped HfO2 thin films. With Al, the substitutional defect hardly favors the ferroelectric phase before the tetragonal phase becomes strongly favored with the increasing concentration. This could explain the observed field induced ferroelectric-ity in Al-doped HfO2. Further Al defects are investigated, but do not favor the f-phase such that the current explanation remains incomplete for Al doping. According to the simulation, doping alone shows clear trends, but is insufficient to replace the monoclinic phase as the ground state. To explain this fact, some other mechanism is needed.

Materlik_Kirsch_Y_Al_La_HfO2_computational_JAP_2018.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Ferroelectricity has been observed in nanocrystalline doped HfO2 thin films produced by atomic layer deposition (ALD),1–8chemical solution deposition (CSD),9or other methods.10,11Two orthorhombic, noncentrosymmetric space groups Pca21 and Pmn21 have been conjectured as the sour-ces of ferroelectricity in HfO2.1,12The Pca21 phase has since been identified in a recent electron diffraction study13as the most likely source of ferroelectricity and, henceforth, will be referred to as the f-phase in this publication. In the same study, the Pmn21 phase was successfully ruled out and, therefore, is not included in this work. Pure HfO2 occurs nat-urally in the monoclinic P21/c phase (m-phase) and trans-forms into the tetragonal P42/mnc phase (t-phase) followed by the cubic Fm�3m phase (c-phase) by increasing the tem-perature.14Besides the two noncentrosymmetric orthorhom-bic phases, a third orthorhombic but centrosymmetric phase with the space group Pbca (o-phase) was found. Given the equilibrium phase diagram of HfO2,12the orthorhombic phases are not stabilized with increasing temperature. In con-trast, high pressure can promote orthorhombic phases to thea)Electronic mail: alfred.kersch@hm.eduthermodynamic equilibrium.15,16Furthermore, electric fields E applied for the reversal of the polarization P favor the f-phase relative to all other phases from the E � P interaction. The appearance of antiferroelectric double hysteresis loops has been explained as a reversible, electric field induced phase transformation starting from the t-phase.17 Different Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies con-sistently calculated the total energy of the o-phase as the sec-ond most stable after the m-phase, followed by the f-, t-, and c-phases. Additionally, DFT was able to reproduce the ther-mally driven phase transformation,12,18giving credibility to the used DFT methods. In search of the mechanism to disad-vantage the energy of the m-phase and in the same manner the structurally similar o-phase, several factors favoring the f-phase have been proposed to explain the ferroelectric phe-nomenon. These commonly include stress, surface, or inter-face energy due to grains, entropy, electric field, doping, and combinations.19–22Based on DFT calculations, doping alone is not sufficient to stabilize the f-phase20,23nor entropy, stress, or electric field.18,22However, the size effect,64i.e., ferroelectricity decreases or disappears with the increasing film thickness in HfO2,24strongly supports a surface or inter-face dependence. Typical grain sizes for ferroelectricity are in the range of film thicknesses from 5 mm to 30 nm,25–280021-8979/2018/123(16)/164101/11/$30.00123, 164101-1Published by AIP Publishing.164101-2Materlik et al.J.

The surface and interface energy have been studied in the Hf1– xZrxO2 system by Materlik et al.18and K€unneth et al.,29 demonstrating that in principle the excess energy created by interfaces or surfaces alone can stabilize the f-phase for all values of x as observed in",827

It is expected that the doping effects simply add to the size effects and do not interfere, as the size effect is related to interface energy between regions of different phases, which should onlyconcentration window was extended up to 20 f.u.%. The dis-crepancy between Chernikova et al. and Schr€oder et al. in the reported ferroelectric process window might be caused by differences in the ALD process. Chernikova et al. used an O2-plasma as an oxygen source, while Schr€oder et al. used H2O as a precursor. O2-plasma deposited HfO2 films are known to have a lower density and higher leakage current density and therefore a higher oxygen vacancy concentration compared to films deposited with H2O.40This might explain the observed difference.

In this work, we limit ourselves to the III-valent Al, Y, and La with increasing crystal radii 53 pm, 104 pm, and 117 pm.31The ferroelectric phase in Al-doped HfO2 was first found by Mueller2in 16 nm thick ALD films on TiN. The dopant concentration was given as 4.3 f.u.% for a ferroelectric film and 8.5 f.u.% for an antifer-roelectric film considered to be the t-phase. The values for the absolute Al concentration were tentative. In a recent sys-tematic study by Park et al.32about 10 nm ALD films, no numbers for the concentration were given, and only the ALD cycle ratio was given. The ferroelectric window was found between 2 and 4 cycles per 100 Hf cycles. For larger Al con-centrations, the tetragonal phase was verified.The ferroelectric phase in Y doped HfO2 was first found by Mueller et al.33in 10 nm thick ALD films in a concentra-tion range of 3 f.u.% to 9 f.u.%.

Lee et al.44calculated the effect of substitutional doping and found Al to favor the t-phase in contrast to Y, which favored the cubic phase. However, the doping concen-tration was only 3 f.u.%.

The stopping criterion for the elec-tronic convergence was a force criterion of 1 � 10–6Ha/h, and the stopping criterion for the structural convergence was a force criterion of 1 � 10–5Ha/h. Some calculations were repeated with the all-electron code “Fritz Haber Institute ab initio molecular simulations” (FHI-AIMS)52for validation of the PPs. FHI-AIMS is based upon numeric, atom-centered orbitals. These calculations used numerical orbitals (NOs) in tight settings with first and second tiers enabled with stop-ping criteria for the electronic convergence of 1 � 10–4eV/A˚and 1 � 10–3eV/A˚ for the structural convergence. In the remainder of this work, we will refer to those two methods as plane waves (PWs) and numerical orbitals (NOs), respec-tively. The k-point grid in ABINIT is based on the 4 � 4 � 4 Monkhorst-Pack grid divided by the number of unit cells in each corresponding direction. The same method was used with FHI-AIMS but with a 6 � 6 � 6 Monkhorst-Pack grid. The plane wave cutoff for ABINIT is 18 Ha, and the PAW cutoff is 22 Ha, in accordance with a convergence study.oxygen partial pressure, the electronically compensated defect MHf is preferred when the charge is not compensated with lattice defects but with holes, lowering the Fermi level. For low oxygen partial pressure, the mixed compensated defect MHf VO is preferred when the charge is compensated with oxygen vacancies and electrons shifting the Fermi level up. The equilibrium concentration of these defects depends on the oxygen partial pressure.The question of the associated charge of these defects requires some consideration. Usually, the charge of a defect depends on its defect structure and defect species and the position of the defect level within the band structure and the Fermi level. A MHf with a II- or III-valent dopant is expected 20,53 to create a defect level close to the valence band of HfO2 and, therefore, to be occupied by an electron carrying a nega-tive charge. This assumes that the Fermi level is not signifi-cantly affected by the presence of the defect, which is the case for sufficiently dilute defects. However, the doping con-centration of ferroelectric HfO2 with an order of magnitude of 1021/cm3is too large for this approximation to be reason-able. Due to the large concentration of the defects of at leastB. Defects1=32 of the cations, we consider the majority of defects to be charge neutral and the Fermi level adapted. This is illustratedAl, Y, and La are III-valent atoms and form metal oxides of type M2O3. For the purpose of this work, these dopants are considered to substitute Hf. The three most important defects calculated for all dopant species are the electronically compensated MHf, the mixed compensated MHf VO, and the ionically compensated (2MHf)VO defects, which differ in the number of associated O vacancies. Examples of these defect structures in a f-phase are dis-played in Fig. 1. In Kr€oger-Vink notation, these defects are represented as follows: the ionically compensated defect (2MHf)VOM2O3 ! 2M0 Hfþ 3OO þ V••O; (1)the electronically compensated defect MHf1=2O2 þ M2O3 ! 2M0 Hfþ 4OO þ 2h•; (2)and the mixed compensated defect MHf VOM2O3 ! 2M0 Hfþ 2OO þ 2V••Oþ 2e0 þ 1=2O2: (3)In ceramic materials, the ionically compensated defect (2MHf)VO is assumed as the preferred structure because of charge compensation without electronic defects.

This definition ensures that structures of equal size and an equal amount of dopant atoms have the same value for the defect concentration attributed to them. For example, the 96-atomic cells with one (2AlHf)VO, (2AlI)VHf, and (2AlI)VHf VO defect each have two Al atoms and therefore must be of equal concentration. The following definition of the defect concentration based upon formula units (f.u.) of HfO2 is used: Each dopant atom is assumed to affect one formula unit of HfO2, regardless where it is placed. A 96-atomic supercell has 32 formula units, and therefore, one dopant atom equals 3.125 f.u.% (¼1 dopant/32 formula units). A 48-atomic cell with 16 formula units and one dopant atom corresponds to 6.25 f.u.% (¼1 defect/16 for-mula units).

The occurrence of the c-phase has been reported in ALD-films37,39and CSD-films.38 From the calculated defect formation energy in Fig. 4(d) and Table II, it follows that the mixed compensated MHf VO defect in all phases is energetically unfavorable compared to the MHf and the (2MHf)VO defect under oxygen-rich condi-tions (see Table II). Taking into account that the (2MHf)VO defect includes two dopant atoms in comparison to the MHf VO defect, which includes one dopant, does not change this preference. The formation energy of the (2MHf)VO defect divided by two is still more favorable than the formation energy of the MHf VO defect under both oxygen-rich andoxygen-poor conditions. Nevertheless, the MHf VO defect might still form under oxygen-poor conditions since it does not require special placement of dopant atoms, unlike the (2MHf)VO defect, which depends on a next-next-neighbor configuration of dopants and vacancy.60,61 To conclude, the mixed compensated defect MHf VO has a high formation energy compared to the ionically compen-sated (2MHf)VO under oxygen-rich conditions. The total energy trend for the f-phase in Al-doped HfO2 is favorable but not sufficient within the narrow ferroelectric concentra-tion range. The t-phase energy required for the observedantiferroelectricbehaviorisneverbelowthef-phase.However, the c-phase may become the energetically most favorable phase within a concentration range for Y and La above 6.25 f.u.%.C. Ionically compensated defectsIonically compensated defects are defect structures where the charge compensation is achieved without elec-tronic defects and the stoichiometric 2/3-ratio of metal and oxygen atoms is realized. However, the defect structure is intricate. These defects are calculated as type (2MHf)VO, and only 96-atomic supercells are used with either one or two defects in the DFT calculations. The 96 possible atom posi-tions of the supercells allow for a large number of configura-tions of the individual dopants and vacancies. To remain within computational time limits, only a subset of all possi-ble configurations has been calculated. This subset is gener-ated for each of the five investigated space groups in the same way. Parkes et al.60,61have determined the energeti-cally most favorable placement of atoms and vacancies of one or two (2MHf)VO defects within a 96-atomic supercell of cubic ZrO2. We have mapped the placement of defects in these cubic structures to the corresponding positions in the other four space groups. Considering all possible assign-ments of lattice constants between the cubic and the other space groups, as well as all rotations, we obtained up to six structural nonequivalent structures for calculation. In our opinion, at least one of the derived structures is a goodFIG. 4. Effect of mixed compensated defects MHf VO on the total energy differences of HfO2 polymorphs relative to the m-phase.

For Al-doping, Figure 5 displays the effect of the ionically compensated defects on the total energy differences, with Al in subplot (a), Y in (b), and La in (c).. The c-phase was found to be unstable for 6.25 f.u.% Y and La doping but was strongly supported for 12.5 f.u.%.. A stable cubic or pseudo-cubic phase is observed in the well-known 10 f.u.% Y stabilized ZrO2 and HfO2 ceramic materials.14,62According to the computation, however, the t-phase and the f-phase are strongly favored as well and are in close competition with the c-phase in the 6 f.u.% to 12 f.u.% range.. Since the t-phase is slightly in advantage for the highest concentration, one could expect antiferroelectric behavior which has not been observed for either dopant.. To clarify the situation, a more detailed investigation in the 12 f.u.% concentration range for competing phases is necessary, which has only been done for cubic ZrO2.63 For Al-doping, no clear trend is visible, which could be an indication that the limited number of calculated defect structures is not sufficient to find the energetic optimum.. The reason might be the much smaller size of Al compared to Y and La, which could lead to favorable structures other than found by Parkes et al.. In the DFT calculations, the c-phase always transformed into the t-phase for Al doping and for 6.25 f.u.% Y and La doping.. However, at 12.5 f.u.%, the c-phase was preserved for Y and La..

We found that for Y- and La-doping, all three defects favor the f-phase in comparison to the m-phase.

Based on the",159
Materlik_Kirsch_Y_Al_La_HfO2_computational_JAP_2018.docx,results,"presented here, we suggest that the reason for this vast difference is the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the defect complexes. The three earlier studies possibly had a high amount of ionically compensated or mixed compensated defects, while in the later study, elec-tronically compensated defects possibly dominated. This is further supported by the fact that Chernikova et al. used O2-plasma as an oxygen source. This process is known to result in lower density and higher leakage current density and therefore a higher oxygen vacancy concentration than the H2O process described by Schr€oder et al.40We therefore predict that it is possible to extend the concentration range of Y-doped ferroelectric HfO2 in a similar manner to La if it is possible to produce a film with a very low concentration of oxygen vacancies.Al-doping did not favour the f-phase significantly, which is why we investigated additional interstitial and O-site defects for Al.

Comparing all three investigated dopants, we found La to be the most effective for producing ferroelec-tricity in HfO2.",102

Recent understanding of the influence of oxygen supplied during film deposition on the structural phase formation process in Hf1-xZrxO2 films has drawn attention to a commonly overlooked parameter for tuning ferroelectric and electrical properties of these films. In this paper, a comparison of O3 and O2 plasma used as the oxygen source in an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process for Hf1-xZrxO2 films within the full compositional range is discussed. A combination of structural and electrical characterization methods grant insight on the influence of each of the oxygen sources on the crystalline phase formation during deposition of Hf1-xZrxO2 films.

NamLab - Next Gen Ferro Memories - IEDM 2019.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Ferroelectrics are materials that show a remanent polarization that can be switched between two directions using an electrical field. The stable nonvolatile polarization paired with the purely field driven switching, make this class of materials a natural choice for nonvolatile memories overcoming the write inefficiency of most other emerging nonvolatile memory concepts [1]. However, typically the materials that show ferroelectricity have a complex structure with three or more compounds and in the case of oxides normally weakly bound oxygen (see fig. 1 b). These properties make them very hard to integrate into a state of the art CMOS process [2]. As a result, the established ferroelectric memory technologies are limited in scaling and therefore are only used in niche applications. Thus, after an intense phase of research and development between the late 1990s and the mid 2000s, the interest in ferroelectrics for memory applications diminished. The discovery of ferroelectricity in doped hafnium oxide (see fig. 1a) has changed that view since hafnium oxide is used as the gate dielectric in modern transistors since 2007. Traditionally, a 1 transistor – 1 capacitor cell (FeRAM see fig. 2a) inspired by DRAM is used in established ferroelectric memory devices. An alternative way is to integrate the ferroelectric into the gate stack of an MOS transistor (FeFET see fig. 2b). Finally, a resistive switching ferroelectric tunneling junction can be achieved when the ferroelectric is made very thin and allows for a polarization dependent tunneling current (FTJ see fig. 2c). All three memory concepts have seen increased activities by using hafnium oxide based ferroelectrics rather than traditional perovskites or layered perovskites.

In the following years, many dopants like Y, Al, Sr, La, Ge, N, etc. were successfully utilized to achieve ferroelectricity. Among the different variants, a special emphasis is on solid solutions of hafnium and zirconium since this material system makes a wide process window for the dopants possible, which",81

Since ferroelectricity is a material property that requires a crystalline structure (see fig. 1), typically an annealing step is carried out after the film deposition or more frequently even after top-electrode deposition. When comparing the properties of ferroelectric hafnium oxide with those of perovskite based ferroelectrics (Table I), the most striking differences are the very high coercive field and the low relative permittivity of HfO2. It was confirmed in 2015 that the phase leading to ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide is the orthorhombic Pca21 phase [5]. This phase is not stable in bulk hafnium oxide. The exact mechanism of its stabilization in thin films is still a matter of intense research. Surface and interface energy have been proposed to play a major role. However, although",195

It has been recently considered, that the kinetic barrier between the thermodynamically stable monoclinic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic phases is important in avoiding the monoclinic phase, such that during cool down existing crystalline regions can be transformed from the tetragonal to the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase [6]. This understanding was substantiated by",140

However, like in DRAMs, a minimum charge is required to allow stable sensing during read (fig. 3c). Therefore, below the 90nm generation a DRAM-like stacked capacitor would be required. Attempts to realize 3D integration of PZT were not successful so far [7]. In contrast, the well-established atomic layer processes for HfO2 allow to easily integrate the material into a 3D stacked capacitor [8]. An alternative way was recently proposed using a 2T-1C cell where the capacitor is coupled to the gate of a read transistor (TR) and a second transistor (TP) is used to precharge the internal floating node SN (see fig. 4) [9]. In such an arrangement, the inherent amplification of the read transistor enables the sensing of very small switching currents, making the sensing of scaled capacitors possible (see fig. 5). However, for a device to challenge DRAM, unlimited endurance is necessary. In this respect the high fields in hafnium oxide based ferroelectrics, which are a consequence of the low layer thickness, paired with the high coercive field, becomes a major limiter. Although recently the understanding, and with this, the enhancement of the cycling endurance has increased (e.g. additional La doping can increase the endurance, see. Fig. 6), making it possible to foresee a cycling endurance of 1010 – 1012. However, unlimited endurance remains a severe challenge. Moreover, the unavoidable depolarization fields become more critical in the thin layer regime as can be seen from fig.7. Therefore, reliability needs careful optimization. An interesting alternative was proposed three years ago [10] using an antiferroelectric material combined with a built in bias field. Test capacitors that use this antiferroelectric RAM concept show improved cycling and imprint behavior. IV.FERROELECTRIC FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORWhen a ferroelectric is integrated into the gate stack of a MOS transistor, the VT of the device will depend on the polarization direction of the ferroelectric. This approach can overcome the scaling limitations of capacitor based ferroelectric memories since the inherent amplification of the transistor allows a constant charge per area rather than a constant absolute charge for proper sensing. Hafnium oxide is especially suited to realize ferroelectric field effect devices. The high coercive field allows for a reasonably sized memory window even in thin films and it also helps to stabilize the retention while the low permittivity reduces the depolarization field. Using such thin films, the material can be integrated into various existing and emerging transistor architectures as illustrated in fig. 8. Moreover, hafnium oxide is the standard gate dielectric in modern CMOS processes, and therefore, the integration into a CMOS process can be done with little process overhead [11]. Fig. 9 illustrates that a standard CMOS device can be integrated next to a FeFET device using the Globalfoundries 28nm FeFET process without deteriorating either the FeFET or the standard CMOS device performance. Full memory arrays show promising performance [11]. Therefore, realizing a low cost embedded nonvolatile memory is in reach. In scaled down devices, new effects are discovered which are attributed to the fact that small devices contain only a limited number of domains [12]. These, together with the possibility to integrate the FeFETs very close to other CMOS devices, open the path towards overcoming the von-Neumann bottleneck. When the stored information inside a FeFET is used as one input variable, calculations with this variable can be done without a memory access [13]. Such gates can be cascaded as shown in fig. 10. Moreover, the accumulative switching dynamics observed in scaled down devices can be utilized to realize the integrate-and-fire behavior of a neuron [14], while the continuous switching of larger devices allows one to realize the spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) of a synapse [15]. The V.FERROELECTRIC TUNNEL JUNCTIONSthe ferroelectric tunneling junction requires ferroelectric to be scaled down to a thickness in the 3nm range or below. Under conditions that are practically relevant for CMOS integration, this is a non-trivial task in hafnium oxide based ferroelectrics. However, when the ferroelectric is combined with a thin tunneling barrier, the switching and the tunneling can be decoupled to a certain degree [16,17] (see fig. 11 and fig. 12a)). A critical issue here is the low read current. Again, the circuit presented in fig. 4 could be an ideal fit. Fig. 12b shows first",1158

Published by AIP Publishing.[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4978032]The initial report on the ferroelectric behavior of doped hafnium oxide (HfO2) has used as doping material less than 4% mol. SiO2. The ferroelectric HfO2 has a 10 nm thickness, the ferroelectric phase being attributed to an orthorhombic crystalline structure.1The physical mechanisms for occur-rence of the ferroelectric phase in HfO2, as well as in ZrO2, are detailed in several papers.2,3 The discovery of ferroelectric HfO2 is of tremendous importance since, although ferroelectric materials are involved in many applications, only perovskite ferroelectrics such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 or PZT have been used up to now. In micro- or nanoelectronics, perovskite ferroelectrics are not fully compati-ble with CMOS technology and suffer from limited scalability. Therefore, ferroelectric random access memories,4ferroelec-tric transistors for low-power applications,5,6or high-mobility graphene transistors on ferroelectric substrates7show moderate developments or are in infancy. In deep contrast, HfO2 depos-ited via the atomic-layer-deposition (ALD) method is fully compatible with CMOS technologies and is commonly used as a high-k dielectric in widespread devices based on the CMOS technology, such as i-phones, laptops, computers, and TV-sets. So, ferroelectric HfO2 could enable various applications work-ing at low DC voltages.In the case of high-frequency applications, the tunability of devices and circuits is a prerequisite for further development of radars, wireless communications, internet, and internet of things. All these high-frequency systems require a precise con-trol of the parameters of devices and circuits, which must quickly adapt to sudden changes in the communication envi-ronment. The electrical tunability of high-frequency devices implying specific materials such as ferroelectrics, polymers, and liquid crystals is a mature domain, recently reviewed in Ref. 8.

Namely, the required DC voltage for tuning the frequency or the phase of such devices attains values of tens or even hundreds of volts, depending on the ferroelectric material.9 It is thus the role of this paper to show that high-frequency devices such as filters, phase shifters, and antennas can be tuned with only few volts when ferroelectric HfO2 is used.

Low losses are expected since the measurements of the microwave behaviour of haf-nium oxide on high-resistive Si indicate in the X band tan d ¼ 0:05.10 Further, we have developed a phase shifter cell consisting of a gold interdigitated (IDT) capacitor integrated in a CPW configuration, as shown in Fig. 3(a).

In addition, from Fig. 3(b) it follows that there are certain frequencies at which a phase shift of even 360�is possible. Such a very large phase shift can be used for electronic scanning of the beam of an antenna array.In this respect, we consider further an antenna array composed of two patch antennas on 10nm Hf0.3Zr0.7O2 ferroelectric deposited on top of 100 lm-thick high resistive Si, all dimensions being indicated in Fig. 4(a). Numerical simula-tions of this array performed using CST confirmed that the iso-lation between the two antennas at 10GHz is �44.72 dB, which is a very good value.

Dragoman_HfZrO2_tunability_APL_2017.docx,experiment,"al data we have used are the most accu-rate and among few available to date extracted from a MIM capacitor TiN/HfO2/TiN with the thickness of the TiN layer of 10 nm grown on Si (the conception of tunability of HfO2 ferroelectric MIM for RF applications is suggested also in Ref. 11). The choice of TiN as the electrode is justified by the fact that this n-type wide band gap semiconductor, with a resistivity of 0.4 X cm and bandgap of 3.4 eV, induces a mechanical stress in HfO2 preserving its ferroelectric state and suppressing the phase transition to the paraelectric phase. The workfunction of TiN is 4.6 eV, which is close to the corresponding value (4.7 eV) in polycrystalline Au in ambient conditions. Since the thickness of Au is twenty times larger than that of TiN and the free-space wavelength involved in this paper is of order of few cm, the TiN capping layer plays practically no role in the electromagnetic simula-tion. In addition, it was already shown that12the electrical and physical characteristics of TiN/HfO2/TiN and Si/HfO2/ TiN capacitors are very similar, which suggests that the dielectric values obtained from Refs. 2 and 4 can be used for simulating HfO2-based ferroelectric compounds on Si. This result is strengthened by another study (Ref. 13 and the refer-ences therein), which shows that Si has a similar role to TiN, namely, it prevents HfO2 to switch from the ferroelectric to the paraelectric phase due to thermal expansion mismatchFIG. 4.

After removing the SiO2 by dilute HF, PE-ALD HfZrOx of 10 nm with HfO2:ZrO2 = 1:1 cycle ratio was deposited on the n-type Si0.56Ge0.44 and in situ PE-ALD TiN of 30 nm was severed as the top electrode. Then, 500◦C-RTA in N2 ambient for 30 s was used to crystallize the HZO into orthorhombic phase. Finally, MFS capacitors were completed by patterning top electrode. The same substrate doping and MFS structure were also prepared on Si substrate for comparison. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyze the crystallinity of HZO while piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), polarization–electric field (P–E), capacitance–electric field (C–E), and current–electric field (I–E) analyses were also carried out to confirm the ferroelectricity. In addition, the in-depth reliability characteristics including endurance, retention, and imprint effects were studied for HZO on Si and Si0.56Ge0.44 substrate. The endurance test was evaluated by applying bipolar ac stress (pulse train with ± 4 MV/cm and frequency from 1 to 10 kHz). The retention performance was characterized by switching and nonswitching reading processes with 4-MV/cm poling voltage.0018-9383 © 2019 IEEE.

Wu_SiGe_FE_TED_2019.docx,DISCUSSION,"A. Ferroelectricity of HfZrOx Fig. 1(a) displays the I–E and P–E curves of HZO on Si0.56Ge0.44 by using bidirectional sweep over ±4 MV/cm and the electrical characteristics exhibit typical behavior of ferroelectricity. Note that both curves were obtained from Positive-Up-Negative-Down (PUND) method to achieve the intrinsic remanent polarization value without being influenced by leakage component. From P–E hysteresis, the coercive field (Ec) can be characterized by the current peak resulted from the polarization switching. The asymmetric Ec is due to a different work function for the top and bottom electrode. Furthermore, as compared to HZO on Si, Pr value for HZO on Si0.56Ge0.44 is enhanced by 58% as shown in Fig. 1(b). The enhanced Pr value for HZO on Si0.56Ge0.44 can be explained by better crystallinity of orthorhombic phase from XRD",225
Wu_SiGe_FE_TED_2019.docx,results,"shown in Fig. 1(c). The crystallinity can be quantized by full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak. The FWHM values of the orthorhombic phase peak corresponding to 30.5◦from Si and SiGe substrate are 1.10 and 0.51, respec-tively. The smaller value suggests a sharper peak and implies that HZO on SiGe substrate corresponds to better crystallinity with a larger grain size on SiGe substrate, leading to stronger ferroelectricity. It may be due to the smaller thermal expansion coefficients (α) as compared to Si counterpart [8], which makes higher mechanical stress on HZO during crystallization and stabilization of the FE phase.B. Cycling-Dependent Electrical BehaviorsFig. 2 shows the P–E and C–E characteristics of HZO on Si0.56Ge0.44 film by applying a course of continuous 1-kHzFig. 4.

As shown in Fig. 2(a), Pr initially increases to the maximum value at 103cycles and then it decreases as the cycles continue to 106cycles. The trend suggests that both wake-up and fatigue effects exist in HZO on Si0.56Ge0.44 film. Similar cycling-dependent butterfly-like C–E features are also observed in Fig. 2(b). Fig. 3 displays the evolution of leakage current (measured at −4 MV/cm) and Pr as a function of cycling number with different frequencies ranging from 1 to 10 kHz for HZO on Si and Si0.56Ge0.44. At 1 kHz, an abrupt leakage current increase is found for HZO on Si, which indicates that a large amount of oxygen vacancy (Vo)-related defects are generated and completely pin domain walls and/or make dielectric breakdown. In addition, the wake-up effect is dominant prior to dielectric breakdown. On the other hand, for HZO on Si0.56Ge0.44, slight wake-up and fatigue effect is observed without dielectric breakdown. As the frequency increases, although dielectric breakdown is no longer found for HZO on Si, there is still significant wake-up and fatigue effects. On the contrary, HZO on Si0.56Ge0.44 shows almost free from these issues up to 107cycles under 10-kHz fatigue frequency. In fact, the wake-up effect is highly dependent on defects in the FE film, especially near the interface between FE film and electrode [9]. Thus, it can be inferred that the interface between HZO/Si0.56Ge0.44 possess fewer Vo and/or better interfacial quality than that of HZO/Si.C. Retention Performance The retention measurements up to 104s were carried out at 25◦C and 85◦C. Prior to the measurement, devices were operated to woken-up state by applying 104cycles with a pulse frequency of 10 kHz. During the measurement, the reten-tion performance forP1 andP0 was evaluated where the definition of these two signals is shown in Fig. 4 which demonstrates the applied waveforms of retention measurement and the corresponding P–V loop. The retention ofP1 can be measured by applying a positive program (PGM) voltage pulse of 4 V (4 MV/cm) to make the device at the +Pr state andAuthorized licensed use limited to: Georgia Institute of Technology.

Failure mechanism in reading ΔP0 with sole (c) depolarization effect and (d) imprint effect.then a negative voltage (−4 V) sweeping for a read operation is applied after a certain retention time. On the other hand, the measurement of retention ofP0 is similar to that offor PGM operation. From the definition,P1 consists of P1 except the negative voltage (−4 V, −4 MV/cm) sweepingadditional charge from dipole switching current since the neg-ative read operation alters the original polarization orientation. By contrast,P0 is composed of charge from displacement and leakage current without the dipole switching current (non-switching part) since the negative read operation does not alter its original polarization orientation, that is, the retention of P0 is to assess how polarization can be maintained with time without switching the dipole orientation while that ofP1 is used to study how much polarization can be switched after certain retention time. Typically, the retention ofP1 andP0 is affected by depolarization effect and imprint effect, and the latter is the root cause of the worse retention performance [10]. Detailed failure mechanism in readingP1 andP0 with sole depolarization field and imprint effect is illustrated in Fig. 5. ForP1, with the sole undesirable Edep effect which would degrade +Pr (PGM) to +Pr (depolarization), as shown in Fig. 5(a), the polarization switching component would be reduced during the reading step and leads toP1, which is smaller thanP1. On the other hand, with the sole undesirable imprint effect, Ec would shift toward a negative direction and makes a smaller negative polarization (absolute value) with retention time as the device is at +Pr. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 5(b), original −Pr (read) becomes −Pr (imprint) and consequently",1271

In brief,P1 can be employed to assess the retention performance by taking both Edep and imprint effect into consideration. ForP0, with the sole undesirable Edep effect, which would degrade −Pr (read) to−Pr (depolarization), as shown in Fig. 5(c), the polarization switching component would become larger during the reading step and lead toP0, which is larger thanP0. On the other hand, with the sole undesirable imprint effect, Ec would shift toward the positive direction but hardly affect −Pr (read) valueFig. 6.

Inset is the current response with voltage sweeping time during read operation for different retention times.with a retention time as the device is at −Pr. As shown in Fig. 5(d), almost intact −Pr (read) value makes negligible polarization switching component during the reading step and an unchangedP0, that is,P0 cannot be used to reflect the retention degradation by imprint effect.Fig. 6 shows the retention ofP0 andP1 at 25◦C and 85◦C for devices on Si and Si0.56Ge0.44. For retention ofP0, almost 100% polarization is maintained up to 104s retention time regardless of substrate type and measurement tempera-ture. The well-preservedP0 can be explained by the high immunity to depolarization effect due to the intrinsically high coercive field for HfO2-based FE material and the sufficient programming pulse to define its original polarization orienta-tion for retention measurement, which is helpful to prevent the memory state from unsaturated polarization [11]. On the other hand, for retention ofP1, the reduction of switched polariza-tion with time occurs and much severer degradation is found for devices on Si than those on Si0.56Ge0.44. At 25◦C, almost 100% polarization can be switched for devices on Si0.56Ge0.44 at the retention time of 104s. However, at the same time, only ∼59% switched polarization can be observed for devices on Si. This much-degraded retention performance is caused by the more significant imprint effect as evidenced by the evolution of current with voltage sweeping time during read operation shown in the inset of Fig. 6. Visible current peak shift for devices on both substrates is observed, implying that the change of the coercive field arising from the occurrence of imprint effect. Since dipoles in an FE material would induce charge trapping at the interfacial layer(IL) and build internal filed across it, more pronounced current peak shift and reduced current response for devices on Si indicate more significant imprint effect. It also means that HZO on Si is more prone to dipole-induced charge trapping at IL between Si and HZO, which may be resulted from the inferior IL quality. At 85◦C, since the charge trapping effect becomes more pronounced, and therefore, devices on Si only showP1 of 41% at the retention time of 104s. On the contrary, those on Si0.56Ge0.44 still enjoyP1 of 70%.D. Physical AnalysisIt has been reported that wake-up and fatigue effect are, respectively, due to process-induced and cycling-induced charged defects that pin the domain walls [12], while reten-tion degradation forP1 is caused by imprint effect, which stems from the trapped charge from the internal dipole-induced electrical field [13]. The improved reliability by adopting Si0.56Ge0.44 can be explained by the thinner sub-oxide IL with higher quality as evidenced by the followingAuthorized licensed use limited to: Georgia Institute of Technology.

Fig. 7 shows the EDS line scan for HZO on Si and Si0.56Ge0.44, and thinner IL between HZO and substrate for Si0.56Ge0.44 can be estimated. From the depth profile for different elements, Ge shows an abrupt distribution near the HZO/ Si0.56Ge0.44 interface, whereas Si tails into IL layer. It can be explained that once O atoms diffuse into the substrate, Si is preferentially oxidized due to lower Gibbs free energy [14]. The absence of Ge–O bonding in interfacial oxide for Si0.56Ge0.44 sample is evidenced by element mapping as shown in the inset of Fig. 7. Further confirmation of the IL thickness is done by TEM analysis as shown in Fig. 8(a). The cross-sectional images reveal an IL of 11 and 6 Å, respectively, for Si and Si0.56Ge0.44. From the viewpoint of the capacitive voltage divider, given identical HZO thickness, thinner IL leads to smaller stress voltage across it. Typically, the IL is a defect-rich layer, a smaller voltage across it would suppress generation of cycling-induced defects. In addition, thinner IL is less possible to trap charges and thus corresponds to superior reliability. In addition to a smaller voltage drop across IL for Si0.56Ge0.44, IL with better quality is the other reason for the improved reliability and it is confirmed by the XPS Si 2p spectra of IL for Si and Si0.56Ge0.44 shown in Fig. 8(b). Compared to Si, SiOx component in IL of Si0.56Ge0.44 is also found but with much weaker intensity and higher oxidation state Si4+, implying higher oxide quality and more stoichiometric bonding with fewer Vo. Furthermore, the interfacial quality was also verified by extracting the interface state density (Dit) from C–V and G–V typical MOS (lightly doped) for Si and Si0.56Ge0.44 (not shown). By adopting a single-frequency Hill–Coleman technique [15], the calculated Dit values for HZO MFS capacitor with Si and Si0.56Ge0.44 substrate are 7.53 × 1012and 5.42×1012eV−1cm−2, respec-tively. About 28% decrease of Dit for Si0.56Ge0.44 sample can be attributed to the barely Ge–O bonding coexistence inReliability of FE-HZO was evaluated on Si and Si0.56Ge0.44 substrate by MFS structure. For HZO on Si0.56Ge0.44, enhanced Pr, insignificant Pr degradation up to 107cycles under fatigue stress, desirable retention at woken-up state, and small imprint effect at 85◦C are obtained, much improved as compared to Si counterpart. The mechanism behind the improved characteristics was investigated by TEM, XPS, and element mapping. It is the thinner IL of (6 Å) with robust quality (fewer Vo) that makes less charge trapping and gener-ation during the test. The",764

yurchuk_miko_FeFET_chargetrapping_TED_2016.docx,EXPERIMENT,"AL DETAILSThe HfO2-based FeFETs studied in this paper were manufactured using a state-of-the-art 28-nm high-k metal-gate technology [2]. The gate-stack consists of a 1.2-nm interfa-cial SiON layer, 9-nm Si-doped HfO2 (Si:HfO2) layer, and 8-nm TiN metal layer. Devices with three different composi-tions of Si:HfO2 films (3.7, 4.4, and 5.6 mol% SiO2) were manufactured. The gate structure of the studied ferroelectric transistors is very similar to that of a high-k metal gate logic transistor. The main difference of a FeFET stack is a thicker and crystalline Si-doped HfO2 film that is used instead of about 2 nm thin amorphous HfO2 layer. All measurements shown in this paper were performed on devices with agate width (WG) and gate length (LG) of 300 and 32 nm, respectively.The charge-trapping and detrapping within the high-k layer of logic transistors are commonly characterized by means of a single-pulse ID–VG technique [8], [25], [26]. It can provide a time resolution of several nanoseconds [27], which allows to study the fast transient nature of the trapping and detrapping effects within the high-k layers. In this paper, we applied the single-pulse technique to examine the trapping phenomena in Si:HfO2-based ferroelectric transistor memories. Due to the similarity of the gate-stack structure of the studied devices to logic transistors, similar time constants for trapping and detrapping processes in the range of several microseconds or even less are expected.The single-pulse measurements were performed on a tran-sistor structure, which was connected in an inverter circuit configuration with a load resistance [26]. A stress pulse was applied to the gate (VG), whereas the drain is biased at a constant voltage. An oscilloscope was used to sense simultaneously the voltages at the drain that is later converted into a drain current (ID). This measurement procedure allowed recording the ID–VG characteristics directly at the rising and falling edges of a gate stress pulse. Thereby the time delay between the stressing and the sensing and, therefore, the amount of charge possibly lost during this delay were practically eliminated. A quantitative estimation of the amount of charge trapped during the stress pulse was made from the threshold voltage shift (�VTH) of the ID–VG characteristics as proposed in [28]. The measurement setup used in this paper allowed exploiting the single gate pulses with rise/fall transition times of 500 ns, while the drain voltage was set to 300 mV in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. The VTH values were extracted using a constant drain current criterion ITH of 3 · 10−6A · (WG/LG) [29], [30].III.",646
yurchuk_miko_FeFET_chargetrapping_TED_2016.docx,DISCUSSION,"A. Device Behavior Dependent on the Si:HfO2 CompositionThe composition of Si:HfO2 has a strong influence on the crystalline structure of the films and, as a result, on their electrical properties. SiO2 doping of 3–4 mol% enables the stabilization of a ferroelectric phase (orthorhombic Pbc21) and, thus, obtaining the ferroelectric behavior in HfO2 films [7], [31]. The same trend was observed for transistor structures, including HfO2 layers with varying silicon con-tent (3.7, 4.4, and 5.6 mol% SiO2) (Fig. 2). The response of the ID–VG characteristics on the negative (−6 V) and positive (+6 V) gate pulses of 100 ns length changed depend-ing on the composition of the gate insulator. Devices with Si:HfO2 layers containing 3.7 and 4.4 mol % SiO2 showed an ID–VG shift opposite to the polarity of the applied gate pulses, which is characteristic for ferroelectric switching. HfO2 layers with 5.6 mol% SiO2, on the other hand, exhibited a prevailing charge trapping properties. Here, the ID–VG characteristics shifted in the direction similar to the polarity of the applied gate pulse. A more extended range of compositions for Si:HfO2 used as a gate dielectrics of CMOS transistors wasYURCHUK et al.: CHARGE-TRAPPING PHENOMENA IN HfO2-BASED FeFET-TYPE NONVOLATILE MEMORIES 3503Fig. 2.

In addition, here the ferroelectric behavior could be identified only in devices containing HfO2 films with compositions stabilizing a ferroelectric phase. Transistors manufactured in the present work demonstrated the most dis-tinct ferroelectric properties for the HfO2 doped with 4.4 mol% SiO2 (Fig. 2). Therefore, all further studies on the interaction between the ferroelectric switching and charge trapping will be performed on devices with this film composition.B. Trapping in Si:HfO2-Based FeFET DevicesThe interplay between the ferroelectric switching and charge trapping in HfO2-based FeFET devices was studied using the single-pulse ID–VG technique. The gate pulse sequence depicted in Fig. 3(a) was used for this purpose. At first a neg-ative pulse of −6 V was applied for 100 ns in order to estab-lish a saturated negative polarization state. It was followed by two consecutive single-pulses with positive amplitude to analyze the electron trapping superimposed on the ferroelec-tric polarization switching. The first positive pulse switched the ferroelectric polarization to the positive state. From the VTH shift between the ID–VG characteristics obtained on the rising (VTH1) and falling (VTH2) edges of this pulse the dom-inating mechanism, ferroelectric switching (�VTH < 0) or parasitic electron trapping (�VTH > 0), could be identified. The second single-pulse was applied with a time delay ofFig. 3. Study of the superposition of the ferroelectric switching and charge trapping in Si:HfO2-based FeFET cells. (a)",804

The ID–VG characteristics on the rising edge of the second pulse (3) were shifted negatively with respect to the characteristic (1). This negative shift can be explained only in terms of ferroelectric polarization switching and not by electron detrapping only, especially if the latter occurs at zero gate voltages as in our case. The ferroelectric switching occurred during the first positive pulse simultaneously to the electron trapping.

These pulse conditions were identified in previous studies [6], as sufficient for establishing a positive ferroelec-tric polarization state (ON memory state) of the HfO2-based ferroelectric memory transistors with a gate-stack similar to that studied in this paper. For all tested pulsewidths the ID–VG characteristics obtained on the falling edge of the first pulse (2) exhibited a positive shift with respect to the charac-teristic obtained on their rising edges (1) [Fig. 3(b)]. Therefore, in all cases, the electron trapping was the dominant mecha-nism. The sign of the shift changed, however, after a delay(from 2 to 5 V) and width (from 100 to 100 μs). A neg-ative polarization state was reestablished each time before the positive double single-pulse sequence by applying an initialization pulse of −6 V for 100 ns.

The arrow size represents the tunneling probability.widths, evidencing an increasing amount of trapped electrons. This response of VTH shift to the pulse amplitude and widths is typical for charge trapping mechanism [26]. The �VTH13, on the other hand, was negative for all pulses. Here, the ferroelectric polarization charge exceeded the trapped electron charge, when the detrapping processes have set in after a delay of one minute. Saturation of the �VTH13 observed for high positive pulse amplitudes and long pulses can be attributed to the characteristic saturation of the ferroelectric polarization. A saturated nature of the ferroelectric polarization and nonsaturated behavior of the charge trapping can explain the nonlinear behavior of the memory window with respect to pulsewidth and amplitude that was reported in previous studies of the HfO2-based FeFETs [33]. Superimposition of charge trapping on the ferroelectric polarization switching was proposed as an explanation for the observed memory window behavior. This assumption could be confirmed in this paper by implementation of the single-pulse technique. In addition this paper shows that the charge trapping occurs and superimposes with the ferroelectric switching already at pulsewidths shorter than 1 μs.Another interesting observation is that the charge trap-ping in the studied Si:HfO2-based FeFETs correlated with the ferroelectric switching [Fig. 3(c)]. Almost no trapping (�VTH12 = 0) was detected for 2 V, where also no fer-roelectric switching took place (�VTH13 = 0). An electron trapping started at 3 V (tTP about 1 μs) and corresponded with the completion of the ferroelectric switching (saturation of �VTH13). In order to clarify the impact of ferroelectricremnant polarization (PR) on the charge-trapping behavior of the gate-stack we performed a simulation of the energy banddiagram using software of reference [30].

The cause is 1.2 nm thin interfacial SiON layer and its stronger band banding resulting from a lower relative permittivity (∼3.9) than that of HfO2 (∼25). Moreover, in comparison to the high-k gate-stack with a nonferroelectric HfO2 layer [Fig. 4(a), (b)], the channel charge injection into the ferroelectric transistor [Fig. 4(c), (d)] is fur-ther enhanced. The internal fields induced by the polarization charge at the SiON/HfO2 interface alter the effective thickness of the tunneling barrier and, thus, the injection probability. The positive ferroelectric polarization established at positive gate voltages assists the electron injection. Under negative gate voltages a negative polarization is induced, which facilitates hole injection (h+) into the HfO2 and back tunneling of trapped electrons at the same time. Therefore, steady transfer of charges through the interfacial layer is inevitable in the ferroelectric stack under alternating program/erase pulses.In the next step, an estimation of the pulsewidth corre-sponding to the onset of the electron trapping at positive voltages was performed. The trapping behavior of the FeFET structure with a positively polarized Si:HfO2 layer was used for this purpose under the assumption that the ferroelectric switching preceded the charge trapping. This assumption wasYURCHUK et al.: CHARGE-TRAPPING PHENOMENA IN HfO2-BASED FeFET-TYPE NONVOLATILE MEMORIES 3505Fig. 6.

Therefore, the analyses were performed using the pulse sequence shown in the inset of Fig. 5(a). Before each trapping pulse, a positive polarization state was reestablished with a combination of a negative (−6 V for 200 ns) and a positive (+4 V for 200 ns) pulses. A time delay of 1 min between the initialization pulse sequence and a trapping single-pulse allowed the detrapping processes to set in. The resulting trapping characteristics (�VTH12) are shown as a function of the trapping pulsewidth for varying pulse voltages [Fig. 5(a)]. The",728

The intersection with the time axis gives the pulsewidth that corresponds to the onset of trapping (tTP0).This tTP0 is equivalent to the critical trapping time intro-duced in [16]. The voltage dependence of the tTP0-value [Fig. 5(b)] identifies two ranges for operation conditions with excluded or comprised parasitic charge trapping. It becomes obvious that for erase voltages above 3.5 V applied for sev-eral nanoseconds ferroelectric switching cannot be separated from the accompanying charge trapping. For the conventional perovskite ferroelectrics polarization switching is normally significantly faster than the charge trapping. In case of the studied FeFET devices it seems not to apply. The reason of the unusually fast trapping is a combination of the high electric field required for polarization switching in HfO2-based ferroelectrics (1–3 MV/cm) and a thin interfacial layer of the transistor gate-stack.C. Impact of Trapping on the Device PerformanceFrom the trapping analyses it can be seen that the charge trapping cannot be completely excluded during the standard erase operation. Therefore, it is expected to impact the per-formance of the HfO2-based FeFET memories. Thus, the influence of trapping on the retention and endurance properties of these devices was examined in this paper.As it was clearly seen form Fig. 3, charge trapping and fer-roelectric switching cannot be separated in a given sample just by changing the operation conditions of the cell. In order to achieve nonvolatile retention the ferroelectric switching effect needs to dominate over charge trapping. This state is achievedafter retention time of a few seconds, when significant part of the trapped charges has detrapped. Fig. 6 shows the nonvolatile retention characteristics for program/erase pulses with varying amplitudes. The width of all program/erase pulses used was constant and amounted to 100 ns. A reduced memory window appears to be a consequence of an increased program and erase amplitude. For higher program/erase voltages the VTH shifted to more negative/positive values, indicating an enhancement of the hole/electron trapping, respectively. These trapped charges within the HfO2 layer compensated the ferroelectric polariza-tion and resulted in reduced ferroelectric memory window. On the other hand, the time dependent VTH decay decreased for both memory states with increasing amplitudes of the program/erase voltages. This can be explained by the lowering of the depolarization field as a result of the compensation of the ferroelectric polarization by trapped charges, which led to more stable retention behavior.Limited endurance properties of HfO2-based FeFETs were previously argued to originate from parasitic charge trap-ping [24]. A continuous charge transport through the inter-facial SiON layer was assumed during program/erase cycling. This",621

An exper-imental evidence of a strong electron trapping at typical erase operation conditions has been demonstrated in this paper. This justifies the endurance model proposed in [24]. Moreover, in order to get better insight into the correlation between the electron trapping and endurance an impact of the time delay between the erase and program pulses was studied (Fig. 7). The memory cell was continuously stressed with alternating program (−6 V for 100 ns) and erase pulses (+4 V for 100 ns). After a certain number of program/erase pulses the memory cell was set in turns into programmed and erased state and a corresponding memory window (MW) was determined. The endurance characteristics were measured for stress sequences which differed by time delays (tDELAY) between the program and erase pulses (100 ns, 100 μs, and 100 ms). A slowing down of the memory window degradation was observed for longer delay times. This behavior can be again explained in terms of charge trapping. For short tDELAY the detrapping of most of the electrons that were trapped during positive3506 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 63, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2016erase pulse occurs under a negative voltage of the subsequent program pulse. From the reliability studies of the high-k gate stacks it is known that detrapping under negative voltages leads to degradation of the interfacial layer [34]. According to the anode hole injection theory [35] the damage of the interfacial layer is mainly caused by hot holes injected from the silicon substrate into the gate-stack. At negative voltages these holesbecome more deleterious since they exhibit higher energiesgained from the electrons tunneling-back into the substratealso with higher energies. For longer tDELAY electrons that were captured during the erase pulse had sufficient time to be detrapped at 0 V before the subsequent negative program pulse. Therefore, the interfacial layer was less damaged in thislatter case due to lower energies of the tunneling-back elec-trons and, thus, lower energies of the injected holes. As a result the endurance behavior improved visibly for longer delay times (Fig. 7). Endurance capability of 105program/erase cycles was achieved with tDELAY of 100 ms.IV.",511

Their main advantages in comparison to ferroelectric transistors based on perovskite ferroelectrics are full CMOS compatibility and better scaling capability.

yurchuk_miko_FeFET_chargetrapping_TED_2016.docx,Experiment,"al evidence for the charge trapping superimposing the ferroelectric polarization switching during standard device operation was demonstrated using the single-pulse technique. The characteristic trapping times in the studied ferroelectric gate stacks were shorter than those known for the standard high-k metal gate stacks [25]. We argue that the main cause of this behavior is the ferroelectric polarization of Si:HfO2 layers that significantly enhances the trapping rate. Modification of the gate-stack structure or/and use of the HfO2 layer with lower ferroelectric polarization will be required for the complete mitigation of the parasitic trapping during device operation. Furthermore, the charge trapping was shown to have a strong impact on the main memory characteristics such as data retention and endurance. The trapped charges improve on the one hand the data retention due to reduction of the depolar-ization field. They are, however, at the same time responsible for the limited endurance capability. The detrapping of the trapped charges is a deleterious effect which triggers the degradation of the interfacial layer in the gate-stack. As a result the endurance characteristics are strongly dependent on the time delay between the erase and program pulses. If detrapping is allowed to set in before the pulse of the opposite polarity is applied, the endurance capability can be extended from 104to 105program/erase cycles.",275

The ZrO2 layer thicknesses is ~7.5 nm in the Z0, ZT, and ZTe MIM structures and the TiN thickness is ~10 nm in the ZT sam-ple, which are consistent with the result given by the SE measurement.As schematically illustrated in Fig. 1(a)-(c), the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structures were fabricated on TiN/Si substrates to charac-terize the AFE and FE properties of ZrO2 thin films, where the TiN layer was used as the adhesion layer. The top and bottom Pt electrodes of the MIM structures were deposited by sputtering at room temperature. The ZrO2 and TiN layers between the top/bottom Pt electrodes were deposited by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (ALD, Fiji, Cam-bridge Nanotech) at 200 °C or 250 °C for ZrO2 and 300 °C for TiN, respec-tively.

The pronounced AFE characteristics of a double hysteresis loop in the P-E curve and quadruple peaks of the switching current in the J-E curve of the ZT sample are presented in Fig. 3 (b). The result in-dicates that the TiN layer capping leads to a dramatic conversion of ZrO2 from the paraelectric phase to the predominant AFE t-phase [28,36,37]. The removal of this TiN capping layer gives rise to the emergence of the hysteresis P-E curve and double peaks of the switching current in the J-E curve, as shown in Fig. 3 (c), revealing the FE behaviors of the ZTe sam-ple. The outcome manifests that the TiN capping layer etching awayFig. 1. Schematic illustration of the ZrO2 MIM structures: the (a) Z0, (b) ZT, and (c) ZTe samples, respectively.

Suman_FeFET_sharp_VLSI_2017.docx,Abstract,": We report, for the first time, a gate last process, used to fabricate Negative Capacitance field effect transistors (NCFETs) with Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) as ferroelectric (FE) dielectric in a metal/ferroelectric/insulator/semiconductor (MFIS) configuration. Long channel NCFET’s with HZO thickness down to 5 nm exhibit consistent switching behavior with switching slope (SSrev) below kT/q over four decades of drain current. Temperature dependent transport study shows that, the effective mobility of HZO NCFETs is 15 % higher than that of HfO2 based control MOSFETs due to suppression of Hf diffusion into the interfacial SiO2 layer (IL). Using the Preisach hysteresis model, which models dynamics of FE switching through a cluster of independent switching dipoles at arbitrary electric field, we (a) explain the asymmetric SS behavior of NCFETs in MFIS configuration, and (b) establish design guidelines for achieving sub-kT/q SS in both forward and reverse sweep direction.",248
Suman_FeFET_sharp_VLSI_2017.docx,Introduction,": The negative capacitance FET (NCFET) has generated great interest as a steep slope transistor option since its inception [1]. Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO), a promising sub-10 nm ferroelectric insulator, is currently being explored as a gate stack for realizing NCFETs [2]. Yet, very few reports exist demonstrating steep switching in practical MFIS-type configuration (without an intermediate metal electrode between the ferroelectric and the linear dielectric) that is eventually required for a simplified gate stack [3], [4] in scaled nodes. Here, we have integrated HZO/SiO2 gate stack on silicon channel using a gate last scheme which allows optimization of the thermal budget for HZO, thereby enhancing its ferroelectric phase integrity. Fabrication: Fig. 1 summarizes the process flow of N-channel NCFETs fabricated using a gate last scheme. For the gate stack, a thin film of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) or HfO2 is grown by ALD and, subsequently, a capping layer of 5 nm thick TiN is deposited by ALD as well. The crystallization of the HZO film is performed using RTP in N2 ambient at 600 0C for 30 s. Fig. 2 shows the high resolution TEM of 5 nm thick HZO stack indicating an interfacial layer of 0.8 nm SiO2 between the HZO and the Si channel.",347
Suman_FeFET_sharp_VLSI_2017.docx,Results,": The ferroelectric (FE) nature of the films is validated by measuring the polarization charge vs gate voltage on, a metal/HZO/SiO2/n++ doped test structure on the same wafer. The expected hysteresis loop is observed in the large signal polarization-voltage measurement as shown in Fig. 3a-c. Small signal CV measurements (Fig. 3d-f) exhibit typical butterfly-shaped hysteresis loops further validating the FE character of the 10 nm, 7 nm and 5 nm FE gate stacks [2]. Fig. 4a shows the IDS-VGS transfer characteristic of N-channel NCFET with 10 nm thick HZO. When VGS is swept from -2 V to 2 V, the device exhibits clockwise hysteresis due to electron trapping from the channel. However, when swept from -4 V to 4 V, the NCFET shows anti-clockwise hysteresis with steep switching in the reverse direction (Fig. 4b). This leads to the important observation that it is crucial to drive VGS beyond the coercive voltage (~3.5 V in this case) to obtain the steep switching. In addition, it signifies that complete dipole switching is essential for the onset of NC effect. The result motivates future efforts to reduce the coercive field (EC) of HZO’s and scale HZO thickness if low voltage NCFETs with steep switching is to be realized. Similar characteristics is observed for 7 and 5 nm FE films, with steep switching occurring during the reverse sweeps (Fig. 5). This trend of SSrev < SSfor is consistent with previous reports on MFIS type NCFETs [4]. Fig. 6 shows SS vs IDS with record sub--kT/q SS spanning over four decades of drain current. Fig. 7a shows SS as a function of VDS with sub-kT/q SS observed until 1.2 V; the degradation in SS with increasing VDS may be attributed to the incomplete switching of dipoles near the drain end. Fig. 7b shows a clear trend in improvement in SS with decreasing HZO thickness. Fig. 7c shows the temperature dependence of SSmin,suggesting no ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition occurring up to the maximum measured temperature. Fig. 8a compares the effective electron mobility (μeff) of HZO NCFET with that of conventional HfO2 MOSFET. The improved mobility in HZO can be attributed to reduction in soft phonon scattering due to reduced diffusion of the Hf ions into the SiO2 IL, previously observed in[5]. Figs. 8b and 8c, respectively, show temperature dependent μeff and extracted remote-phonon limited mobility for 5 nm HZO at 0.5 MV/cm. Modeling: A possible reason for SSrev < SSfor can be explained by the asymmetry in remnant polarization (Pr(+) ≠ Pr(-)) typically observed in MFIS structures (Fig. 3), which are inherently different from MFM type structures (Pr(+) = Pr(-)). This occurs due to the difficulty (or ease) in completely flipping negatively-oriented domains (switchable with EC (-)) as compared to positively- oriented domains (switchable with EC (+)) or vice-versa. Reasons for this asymmetry are due to the distribution of charged defects at top and bottom electrodes, work function difference, electron (or hole) injection from the channel before dipole switching, and the channel doping type (n or p). This effect is studied through numerical simulation of MFM and MFIS stacks, wherein the properties of FE material are modelled using Preisach hysteresis model [6]. Fig. 9 shows the simulated polarization hysteresis loop of MFM stack; with decreasing applied voltages, minor FE hysteresis loops start to appear due to partial dipole switching, consistent with",839
Suman_FeFET_sharp_VLSI_2017.docx,experiment,"s. Fig. 10 shows the different cases for MFIS stack. Due to ease in completely accessing EC (-), full negative saturation polarization is reached for FE in MFIS stack (Case I: 10 nm FE), and, therefore, it follows the major path in the forward direction with visible NC effect. However, due to the work function difference, positive saturation polarization is not reached (incomplete flipping of positively-oriented domains take place) and thus the FE follows the minor path in reverse direction without any NC effect. The opposite effect is illustrated in case II. Due to the presence of negative trapped charge (electrons) at the FE/SiO2 interface, it is difficult for FE to completely surpass EC (-) and, therefore, it follows a minor loop in forward direction (without NC effect) and major loop in reverse direction (with NC effect). Thus, the surface potential gain (Fig. 10e) greater than unity is only observed in the reverse case, explaining the phenomenon of SSrev < SSfor. Employing scaled FE provides the opportunity to observe NC effect in both sweep directions as explained in Fig. 10f-g (Case III: 3 nm FE). With lower coercive voltage in 3 nm thick FE, complete saturation polarization is reached for both forward and reverse direction within the same applied electric field across the gate stack.

Time evolution of ΔPs, ΔQt, and ΔQt-ΔPs (corresponding Ferroelectric-HfO2 (FE-HfO2) based memory has attracted much attention because of the CMOS compatibility and scalability.. Among various ferroelectric memory cell structures, FeFET and FTJ are especially promising in terms of non-destructive nature and compactness.. HfO2 FeFET is suitable for high-speed and low-power storage applications [1-3], while HfO2 FTJ can be utilized for high-density, high- performance, and low-power in-memory computing applications because of its analog switching property, high non-linearity, and excellent uniformity [4-6]..

II.HFO2FEFET In spite of attractive features of HfO2 FeFET, challenges such as small memory window (MW), window reduction during retention, and limited endurance remain to be solved.. So far, it has been reported that charge trapping at the interface between the ferroelectric layer and the interfacial layer in addition to polarization itself strongly affects FeFET operation [1,7,8].. However, the quantitative extraction of both spontaneous polarization (Ps) and trap charges (Qt) during memory operation has not been performed.. Very recently, we have developed an analysis scheme to extract Ps and Qt during memory operation in HfO2 FeFET and clarified the dominant factors of MW and reliability [9]..

This study reports the latest advances for FE-HfO2-based memory cells and arrays. For the 1T FeFET memory approach, retention in the range of 10 μs up to 104 seconds was measured both after 102 and 104 endurance cycles. At room temperature, memory windows of 0.8 V and 0.7 V were extrapolated to ten years respectively. Moreover, a novel operating scheme for a 1T FeFET AND architecture is presented allowing for true random access operation of the array. With respect to capacitor-based memory cells, high aspect ratio ferroelectric trench capacitors are demonstrated which show proper memory characteristics up to 105 cells in parallel. In order to bring these concepts closer to commercialization, device statistics of larger amounts of memory cells have to be provided. For the first time, the functionality of small FeFET memory arrays is shown and the statistical distribution of memory characteristics is analyzed.

Muller_AND_array_2015.docx,INTRODUCTION,"In 2011, ferroelectric behavior in doped hafnium oxide (FE-HfO2) was published for the first time [1]. Due to the fact that hafnium oxide was also introduced as gate oxide replacement back at that time, first publications could verify the functionality of FE-HfO2-based ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs) [2]. In this transistor configuration, a binary state is encoded in a non-volatile fashion by use of the polarization state of the ferroelectric. That is, if the polarization is pointing towards the channel region, an inversion channel is created whereas accumulation is induced in case the polarization is pointing into the opposite direction (Fig. 1a). Since the",156
Muller_AND_array_2015.docx,introduction,"of HfO2 at the 45 nm technology node, most of the succeeding technology generations today are utilizing hafnium oxide as gate dielectric. Due to this, in 2013 it was possible to demonstrate the world’s first 28 nm FeFET J. Müller, P. Polakowski Fraunhofer IPMS - Center Nanoelectronic Technologies Dresden, Germany S. Flachowsky GLOBALFOUNDRIES Dresden Module One LLC & Co. KG Dresden, Germanybased on a high-k metal-gate process flow of semiconductor manufacturer Globalfoundries [3]. Besides the very appealing concept of a one-transistor (1T) based memory application like the FeFET, ferroelectric memories are nowadays actually commercialized as one-transistor one-capacitor (1T-1C) architectures. In this capacitor configuration, the binary state is again encoded in the polarization state of the ferroelectric, however, the read-out operation is destructive and based on the switching response of the capacitor (Fig. 1b). aVGbVPLP0 VVReadFEPor0 VFEGateP0.1 VPorGateInsulatorInsulatorSourceDrainSourceDrainLog Drain Current|Plateline Current|PPPPPlateline Voltage VPLGate Voltage VGFig. 1: Memory operation of 1T and 1T-1C FRAM.

(b) For the 1T-1C architecture, the binary state is encoded in the magnitude of the switching current. In the following paragraphs, the latest findings on both FeFET and capacitor memory cells will be presented. Finally, memory characteristics of small FeFET arrays are shown for the first time and shall support the commercialization of FE-HfO2-based memory applications. 978-1-4799-9974-3/15/$31.00 ©2015 IEEE 233II.28 NM FEFET FOR 1TFRAM 28 nm FeFETs could be realized in the past by increasing the thickness and by doping of the HfO2 of standard high-k metal-gate (HKMG) logic transistors. Two of the most important memory characteristics, i.e. cycling endurance and data retention, were appropriately demonstrated [3]. However, for real memory applications it is essential to also ensure proper data retention after the device has endured a significant amount of stress cycles. In order to set up a so called retention after endurance test, a special measurement procedure was implemented utilizing a Keithley SCS-4200 semiconductor analyzer equipped with one pulse-measurement-unit (PMU). A pulse train was created that was first stressing the device by continuous polarization reversal applying a ± 5 V / 10 μs bipolar gate voltage for 102 or 104 times while keeping the drain, source and bulk terminals grounded. The stress sequence ended with a negative gate voltage thereby inducing the high-VT state for the FeFET. This state was measured immediately after 10 μs using an Id-Vg sweep from -5 V up to 5 V gate bias (Vd = 100 mV) that lasted for 10 μs as well. After holding the gate voltage at 5 V for 10 μs, which should in principle induce the low-VT state, an Id-Vg sweep was again performed back to -1 V gate bias. Subsequently, the gate was grounded and an Id-Vg sweep from -1 V to 1 V gate bias was performed once per time decade in order to cause the least possible state disturb (Fig. 2a). a102x /10 μs3100 μs104s+5V104x1212-5VThe",989
Muller_AND_array_2015.docx,results,"of the characterization showed that the high-VT state could be induced appropriately. However, the low-VT state which should follow on the falling edge (number 2 in Fig. 1a) was superimposed by severe electron trapping due to a shift to a significantly high threshold voltage of around 3 V (Fig. 2b). This is in accordance to previous publications where strong electron trapping for HfO2-based FeFET devices was reported [4]. Already the succeeding Id-Vg sweep could recover a positive memory window which was growing up to a retention time of one second (Fig. 2c). This can be explained by continuous detrapping of electrons from the gate stack, partially accelerated by the negative starting voltage of the intermediate Id-Vg sweeps. After one second retention time, the memory window decreased in a logarithmic manner as would be expected for classical FeFETs as well. By logarithmic extrapolation a 0.8 V and a 0.7 V memory window for 102 and 104 previously applied stress cycles can be estimated after ten year data retention at room temperature. These",226
Muller_AND_array_2015.docx,results,"verify that even after a certain amount of stress cycles, data retention in HfO2-based FeFET devices is possible. Besides FeFET device characteristics, the operation of memory cells in an 1T AND array configuration had also been analyzed in the past [5]. These studies led to the discovery of a novel operating scheme called the “Positive-Source-Drain-Erase-Scheme” (PSDES) that shall be presented in the following. The scheme is specifically targeted at bit-wise writing of the high-VT state (erased state) within a FeFET AND array. It therefore differs from traditional block wise / Flash-type erase and allows for true random program / erase operations (Fig. 3). b10-212Program via VDD/3SL / BL (n)SL / BL (n+1) [A]Erase via PSDESDrain Current10-3-1124510-43WL (m)10-5retention timeWL (m+1)c0123Gate Voltage [V]Mem.

The major advantage of the scheme is its bit-selectiveness and that it holds promise to be applicable also to advanced silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology nodes. III.3DTRENCH CAPACITORS FOR 1T-1CFRAM In the last two decades the challenging scaling of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) has proven to be one of the biggest drivers for material and process innovation in the semiconductor industry. Especially the vertical integration of the storage capacitor in the commonly adapted one-transistor one-capacitor configuration has led to numerous advances in etch and thin film technology. However, despite these tremendous advances in DRAM scaling, which is currently being produced at the 2X nm technology node, one-transistor one-capacitor based FRAM is still lacking far behind. Even though from a technology point of view FRAM can be understood as a non-volatile analogue of DRAM, their integration and material challenges are markedly different. In order to follow the pathway of the highly scaled DRAM, a three-dimensional integration of the ferroelectric capacitor in FRAM will eventually be required. Besides numerous issues related to the conformal deposition of the commonly used material stacks, a simple steric problem induced by the inadequate thickness scaling of the ferroelectrics manifests as the most fundamental issue. Naturally, the minimum diameter of a trench capacitor or cylindrical stack capacitor, as well as the lateral spacing of a simple stack capacitor is linked to the total thickness of the metal-ferroelectric-metal stack being integrated. Considering the difficulties in scaling ferroelectric film thickness of the commonly used PZT below 30 nm [6] the lateral foot print of the capacitor remains rather large and comparable to the planar approach. Therewith the advantages of a three-dimensional integration become obsolete and are not simply linked to a maturity issue of thin film technology. With the ability to sustain ferroelectric properties in the single digit nanometer range, HfO2- or ZrO2-based thin films in combination with simple nitride based electrodes appear ideally suited for the three-dimensional integration of CMOS-compatible ferroelectric capacitors. Considering the similar choice of material in state of the art DRAM, a comparison of FRAM to DRAM is now truly valid. With the purpose of volatile data storage these material stacks have been integrated into high aspect structures and have proven high volume manufacturability. A first proof of concept concerning the sustainability of the ferroelectric properties in high aspect structures is presented in Fig. 4 [7]. The area enhancement achieved by the extension of the Al:HfO2 based ferroelectric capacitor into multiple silicon trenches (Fig 4a) is almost fully reflected in the corresponding polarization-voltage characteristics normalized to the capacitor area (Fig. 4b). Based on these first",602
Muller_AND_array_2015.docx,results,"it can be concluded that the loss of remanent polarization related to three-dimensional processing is minimal and ferroelectric phase stability is maintained along the entire depth of the trenches.

The cells had a channel length of 34 nm and a width of 210 nm each. In a first measurement, the high-VT state of each cell was extracted after a negative wordline bias of -7V / 1us was utilized to set the state wordline-wise. Afterwards, a cell wise program operation to the low-VT state was performed utilizing an incremental-step-pulse-programming (ISPP) scheme known from Flash memories [9].

Russia_LaHZO_ACSAMI_2018.docx,ABSTRACT,": Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films are one of the most appealing HfO2-based ferroelectric thin films, which have been researched extensively for their applications in ferroelectricmemory devices. In this work, a 1 mol % La-doped Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin film was grown by plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition and annealed at temperatures of 450 and 500°C to crystallize the film into the desired orthorhombic phase.Despite the use of a lower temperature than that used in previous reports, the film showed highly promising ferro-electric propertiesa remnant polarization of ∼30 μC/cm2 and switching cycle endurance up to 4 × 1010. Theperformance was much better than that of undoped Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films, demonstrating the positive influenceof La doping. Such improvements were mainly attributed to the decreased coercive field (by ∼30% compared to the undoped film), which allowed for the use of a lower applied field to drive the cycling tests while maintaining a high polarization value. La doping also decreased the leakage current by ∼3 orders of magnitude compared to the undoped film, which also contributed to the strongly improved endurance. Nonetheless, the La-doped film required a larger number of wake-up cycles (∼106cycles) toreach a saturated remnant polarization value. This behavior might be explained by the increased generation of oxygen vacanciesand slower migration of these vacancies from the interface to the bulk region. However, the maximum number of wake-up cycles was less than 0.01% of the total possible cycles, and therefore, initializing the film to the maximum performance state would notbe a serious burden.",400
Russia_LaHZO_ACSAMI_2018.docx,INTRODUCTION,"Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films are the leading candidate material among the various cation-doped HfO2-based ferro-electric (FE) thin films for semiconductor memory applica-tions.. This is mainly due to the lower processing temperature in the film deposition and annealing of the material (less than 500°C for annealing is required for crystallization1−3) compared to other films, such as Si- or Al-doped HfO2 films, which require at least ∼800 °C for sufficient crystallization.4−6The most feasible film deposition method is atomic layer deposition (ALD), which offers high reproducibility, precise thickness control, and conformal coverage over extreme three-dimensional structures.. Moreover, it can be applied not only for growth of functional FE layers but also for CMOS-compatible electrodes, including TiN, Ru, Ir, and so forth.7,8ZrO2 thin films have a lower crystallization temperature compared to HfO2, making the crystallization of HZO films feasible at such a low temperature.. metal−ferroelectric−metal (MFM) structure, where the typical electrode metal is TiN, into the back-end-of-line process, which requires a low temperature (preferably <500 °C)..

The diffraction peaks at 2θ values of ∼30°, 35°, 50°, and 60°−63° suggest that all HZLO films were crystallized even after RTP at 400 °C, despite the well-known amorphization effect of La doping.18,19However, it has been reported that the precise determination of the present crystalline phases is quite challenging because the major peaks from the t- and o-phases overlap. Moreover, stabilization of the cubic phase (c-phase, space group Fm3m) with very close peak positions cannot be excluded. The most intense diffraction peak near ∼30°, which may consist of [111]o, [111]t, and [111]c reflections, where the subscripts o, t, and c refer to the o-, t-, and c-phases, respectively, may be informative to identify the structural evolution with an increasing RTP temperature. The peak position showed a monotonic shift from ∼30.46° to∼30.40° with an increasing annealing temperature from 400 to 500 °C (Figure 1b). According to the appended reference patterns in the lower portion of Figure 1a, this shift may indicate a more preferred o-phase formation with an increasing RTP temperature. Similar shifts were observed previously for2703 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b15110ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch ArticleFigure 3.

The increased grain size in the HZLO film compared to that in the HZO film is not consistent with the previous report on thesuppression of the grain growth by the incorporation of La into HZO.26The reason for such an abnormal behavior is notclearly understood at this moment, but it is quite notable that the HZLO film contains almost no m-phase despite its larger grain size. This is a demonstration of the positive effect of Ladoping, which may suppress m-phase formation by decreasing the bulk free energy difference between the m- and o-phases. Next, the FE properties of the HZLO films were evaluated. Figure 3a,b shows the Is−E curves for HZLO after RTP at 450 and 500 °C, respectively, in response to the application of a voltage sweep at 100 Hz to the pristine sample (first switch, dotted line) and after 105switching cycles (solid line) with a 2.5 MV/cm amplitude. The resulting Pr−E curves are presented in Figure 3c,d. To make a clear comparison, the same",841

The HZO films showed a relatively well-defined single peak in the negative E region in their Is−E curves for both the pristine (first switch) and awakened states (after 105switching cycles). However,there was certainly an involvement of additional peaks makingthe peak shape asymmetric in the positive E region. These findings suggest that the film possesses nonuniform Ec values. The peak intensity does not change considerably withincreasing switching cycles, suggesting that the wake-up was not significant in this case. The only notable finding is theincreased peak height with an increased RTP temperature, suggesting greater o-phase formation, which was confirmed by the higher 2Pr value (∼25 μC/cm2) in Figure 3h compared to the 2Pr value of ∼21 μC/cm2in Figure 3g.By contrast, HZLO films showed quite distinctive Is−E curves compared to those of the HZO films. There are multipleswitching peaks both in positive and negative E regions, suggesting that HZLO films annealed at both temperatures contain several types of grains with different Ec values. Here, the positive and corresponding negative E values, where the observed peaks correspond to the switching field (Es) and back-2704 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b15110ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch ArticleTable 1.

The details of the utilized procedure are presented in the Supporting Information section S2 FORC Measure-ments.The HZLO film after RTP at 450 °C was taken as a representative sample and investigated in detail. Because the HZO films did not show notable wake-up, they were not examined using this method. In Figure 4, the switching density (ρ) is plotted as a function of Ebias and Ec for different numbers of wake-up cycles, that is, after 103, 104, 105, and 106switches. Here, pulses with a 2.5 MV/cm amplitude were applied for switching. If there were no notable internal Ebias and dispersed Ec values among the different regions, a ρ value with a single bright intensity would appear at Ebias = 0 and a given Ec. Therefore, the appearance of two bright spots with a rather wide range along the Ec axis and location off of Ebias = 0 suggests that there are wide variations in Ec among the different HZLO grains and internal Ebias. These bright regions (representing groups of domains) move toward each other during the wake-up process but do not merge completely even after the full wake-up (106cycles). The first group of domains, which are termed “stable” domains, showed a positive Ebias1 of∼0.5 MV/cm for the maximum ρ from the low cycle numbers, which almost did not change during the wake-up. However, the second group of the domains, which are termed “unstable”domains, initially had an Ebias2 of ∼−0.5 MV/cm and showed noticeable shifts toward the positive Ebias direction during cycling before saturating at an Ebias2 of ∼0.1−0.15 MV/cm. At the same time, an increase of the integrated magnitude of ρ with cycling was observed, which is in good accordance with the increased 2Pr value during wake-up (shown later). Interestingly, the increased ρ was seen mostly for the unstable domain group, while the stable group appeared to be much less sensitive to cycling. Such behavior of the unstable domains coincides with the previously discussed trend of the disappearance of the built-in field and depinning of the pinned domains during the wake-up cycles.26,28,29This effect could be due to defect (VO) redistribution from the FE/electrode interface toward the bulk, which is also accompanied with a phase transformation from the non-FE phase to the FE phase near the interface during cycling, as suggested by Grimley et al.30It is also notable that there are stable domains during the wake-up cycling process in the HZLO film, suggesting that there are FE domains free from the adverse influence of defects and their distribution. The Ec distributions for both groups of domains remained rather wide, that is, from 0.5 to 1.5 MV/cm, during wake-up. These behaviors reveal the complicated FE2705 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b15110ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch ArticleFigure 5.

After the maximumswitching cycles, the samples showed hard breakdown (excluding 2.3MV/cm case for the HZLO film).Figure 4. A similar increase in the maximum 2Pr with an increasing Es can also be observed for the HZO film (Figure5b). However, the relative drop of 2Pr in HZLO with a decreased applied electric field from 3.0 to 2.3 MV/cm was∼20%, whereas it was ∼25% for HZO.The improved endurance characteristics for the HZLO filmdue to its low Ec value were confirmed",1376

The HZLO film can endure up to ∼4 × 1010cycles for 2.3 MV/cm,while maintaining considerably high 2Pr (30 μC/cm2up to 108cycles) and displaying no breakdown. The decreased Ec value by La doping allowed for the use of a lower cycling field, whichlargely mitigates the risk of breakdown. Therefore, genuinefatigue behavior can be observed, and there was a decrease inthe 2Pr value by 25% at the end of the endurance cycling test.Such degradation might have a similar origin as that forconventional perovskite-based FE materials, that is, domainpinning by defect generation and accumulation.31Even for theHZLO film, the adoption of a higher cycling field (3.0 MV/cm)also increases the risk of breakdown, and the film can only becycled up to 2 × 108cycles. However, the same field",215

Therefore, the overall cycle endurance performance was greatly improved by 1 mol % La doping. The reasons for such improvement seem to be twofold: (1) the lowered Ec value, which allowed using a lower cycling field and (2) the lower leakage current. Indeed, as was expected, the dc current density−electric field (J−E) character-istics of the HZLO and HZO films after RTP at 450 °C (the related image is presented in the Supporting Information section S3 dc-IV Characteristics of HZLO and HZO Films) revealed that the HZLO film has a current density considerably lower (in fact, by almost 3 orders of magnitude) than that of HZO at 1 MV/cm. Although identifying the precise origin for such a high J improvement requires further study, such as conduction mechanism analysis and band structure identi-fication by XPS, it is evident that the lower leakage current considerably contributed to the improved reliability and endurance of the HZLO film.The prolonged wake-up behavior in the HZLO films might be understood from the literature, where the wake-up mechanism has been elucidated. It has been suggested that a very high defect density (mostly VO) region, especially at the boundary between the FE HfO2 and TiN electrodes, adversely interferes with FE switching in the pristine state.32The presence of such a defective layer",336
Russia_LaHZO_ACSAMI_2018.docx,results,"in a built-in Ebias in the film, leading to noticeable nonswitched areas inside the film. This is consistent with the observations of the finite Ebs and multiple values of Ec in Figure 4. During multiple switching cycles, the diffusion of VO occurs from the interface to bulk regions, which can considerably diminish the VO concentration gradient, leading to a relaxation of the built-in field and thus wake-up completion.28In this case, the PAALD process for the HZLO film growth ending with La−O layer deposition can lead to a higher defect density at the top interface, as La is known as an effective VO-generating dopant.15,33Thus, many switchingFigure 6.

Mater. Interfaces 2018, 10, 2701−2708ACS Applied Materials & InterfacesResearch Articlecycles are required to fully wake-up the HZLO film, which was not necessary for the HZO film.On the other hand, the nonemergence of such a significant wake-up effect in the HZO film might be ascribed to a much higher charge injection compared with the HZLO film case during the wake-up cycles, as could be inferred from the J−Ecurves shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. Theinjected charge carriers could pin the FE domains of the HZO film, and the 2Pr cannot be increased to the value it should have if there were no charge injections. However, this is unlikely because of the following reason. When the J−E curve of the HZLO film was extrapolated to the E value of 3.0 MV/cm, the J level of the film becomes similar to that of the HZO film at 2.3−2.5 MV/cm. Thus, if the charge injection caused the 2Pr suppression, the wake-up should not be observed for the case of the HZLO film at 3.0 MV/cm, which was obviously not thecase. Therefore, this possibility can be ruled out.Finally, the effect of La doping was examined after RTP at 400 °C. Figure 6a,b shows the P−E and Is−E curves of the HZLO film, respectively. They correspond to an antiferro-electric (AFE)-like behavior, and such behavior did not vary up to 105switching cycles (dotted and solid lines). However, the HZO film, annealed under the same conditions, demonstrated a pure FE response from the first switching cycle (Figure 6c,d) with a 2Pr value as high as 25 μC/cm2. Such AFE-like behavior of HZLO after RTP at 400 °C may be related to a t-phaseformation, which is consistent with the GIXRD spectrapresented in Figure 1. Indeed, it has been suggested previously that reversible t−o field-induced transformation can account for the AFE-like behavior.32Figure 7 shows the variation of the kFigure 7. k values of the HZLO film as a function of the RTP temperature in the temperature range of 400−500 °C.value of the HZLO film estimated from the C−V measure-ments, as a function of the RTP temperature. Here, k valueswere taken outside the switching regions, that is, at 2.5 MV/cm,to represent only the linear dielectric contribution. The k value was ∼38 at 400 °C and decreased to ∼33 at 450 and 500 °C. Itis well-known that higher-symmetry crystalline phases of HfO2 are characterized by higher k values. For example, k ≈ 30 and k≥ 35 have been reported for the o- and t-phases, respectively, in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films.1,2Therefore, the observed trend in Figure 7 is consistent with the assumption of a higher t-phase fraction after the RTP at 400 °C.

Ishiwara_Tokumitsu_2001_Jpn._J._Appl._Phys._40_2917.docx,Introduction,"Recently, ferroelectric-gate field-effect-transistors (FETs)1–4)have attracted much attention for nonvolatile memory applications.. Using ferroelectric-gate FETs, one-transistor-cell type nonvolatile ferroelectric ran- dom access memory (FeRAM) can be obtained and the ferroelectric-gate FETs obey the scaling rule for high-density implementation.. Furthermore, in such “transistor-type” FeRAMs, the stored data can be read out nondestructively.. In addition, we have proposed the use of ferroelectric-gate FETs in neural network systems as analog memories to store synaptic weights.5)We have also fabricated a neuron chip with a Pt/SrBi2Ta2O9/Si ferroelectric-gate FET and a pulse oscillation circuit, and demonstrated an “adaptive-learning”function.6) To fabricate ferroelectric-gate FETs, ferroelectric materials have to be deposited on silicon substrates.. Such a device is called a metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor (MFS) FET, How-ever, preparation of the ferroelectric/Si structure with good interface properties is extremely difficult.. When ferroelectric SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) is directly grown on Si by the sol-gel tech-nique, a relatively thick (7–9 nm) transition layer, which is probably an SiO2 layer with poor electrical properties, can be unintentionally formed.7)Hence, it is a common technique to insert an insulating buffer layer between the ferroelectric ma-terial and Si to improve the interface properties.. Such a struc-ture is called a metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MFIS) structure.. Another structure for ferroelectric gate FETs is a metal-ferroelectric-metal-insulator-semiconductor (MFMIS) structure, where a metal is additionally inserted be-tween the ferroelectric and insulating layers.. The MFMIS structure has a merit that the area of an MFM ferroelectric capacitor (SF) and that of an MIS diode (SM) can be inde-pendently designed..",512

Accumulation and inversion capacitances as a function of the data retention time for the MFM-MIS structure when (a) small and (b) large voltages are applied for programming.the total voltage applied to the MFM-MIS structure is swept from +4.7 to −5.4 V, the estimated electric field applied to the SBT film is approximately 150 kV/cm. Hence, from the P–E hysteresis shown in Fig. 1(a), an almost saturated hys-teresis loop is used in the measured MFM-MIS structures.Using this MFM-MIS structure, we measured the data retention characteristics with different programming volt-ages. Figure 3 shows the accumulation and inversion ca-pacitances as a function of the data retention time for the same MFM-MIS structure when small (50 kV/cm) and large (200 kV/cm) voltages are applied for programming. The de-polarization fields during the data retention are estimated to be 20 kV/cm and 25 kV/cm in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respec-tively. It is found that when the programming voltage is small, the capacitance change decreases rapidly with time and be-comes almost zero after 200 s. On the other hand, the data retention characteristics can be significantly improved by us-ing a large programming voltage even though the depolariza-tion fields during the data retention are about the same for both cases. This result suggests that saturated P–E hystere-sis is much more stable than a minor P–E loop when the ferroelectric capacitor is reversely biased (i.e., under depolar-ization field). Hence, it is important to use a saturated P–E hysteresis loop of the ferroelectric layer to obtain a long data retention time.3. Simulation and Design of Ferroelectric-Gate FETsTo design the MFMIS-FETs, the operation voltage and memory windows should be determined. From our previous work, it is reported that a subthreshold swing of the Pt/SBT/Pt/STA/SiON MFMIS-FETs is about Hence, to obtain the drain current 200–250 mV/decade.on-off ratio larger than 5 orders of magnitude, the memory window of the MFMIS-FET should be larger than 1.25 V. In this section, we assume the MFMIS structures to obtain a memory window of more than 1.5 V with an operation volt-age of less than 5 V. We numerically simulated the transistor characteristics of MFIS and MFMIS-FETs using ferroelec-tric SBT films by Miller’s model.16)In the simulations, spon-taneous polarization PS, remanent polarization Pr, coercive field EC, and relative dielectric constant εr of the SBT films are assumed to be 13 µC/cm2, 11.5 µC/cm2, 40 kV/cm, and 200, respectively. These are typical values of the SBT films fabricated by the “face-to-face” annealing technique. The SiO2 equivalent thickness of STA/SiON “I” layer is assumed to be 4.5 nm.We first calculated the drain current-gate voltage (ID–VG) characteristics of the MFIS structures with various SBT thick-nesses as shown in Fig. 4(a), assuming the operation voltage of 5 V. The SBT thickness is varied from 200 to 600 nm. Since the memory window is given by 2VC, to obtain a mem-ory window of more than 1.5 V, the SBT film must be thicker than 187.5 nm, if the coercive field EC of the SBT film is as-sumed to be 40 kV/cm. It is found that the memory window is as small as 0.75 V when the SBT thickness is 200 nm, whereas a large memory window can be obtained if we use a thick SBT film. However, in the MFIS structures, the used P–E hysteresis loop is one of the minor loops as shown in Fig. 4(b). Figure 4(b) shows the P–E hysteresis loops used in the MFIS structures with the SBT thicknesses of 200, 400, and 600 nm when ±5 V is applied. For the MFIS structure with a SBT film thickness of 200 nm, the electric field applied to the SBT film is only 35 kV/cm when 5 V is applied to the MFIS structure, which is smaller than the coercive field of the sat-urated P–E loop. When the SBT film thickness is increased2920Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. Vol. 40 (2001) Pt. 1, No. 4BE. TOKUMITSU et al.Fig. 4. Calculated (a) ID–VG characteristics of the MFIS structures with various SBT thicknesses and (b) P–E hysteresis loops used in the MFIS structures when ±5 V is applied.to 600 nm, the applied electric filed becomes even smaller, al-though the large memory window can be obtained because of the thick SBT film. This is undesirable for improving the data retention characteristics as shown in the previous section. The reason why only minor loops can be used in the MFIS struc-ture is that the remanent polarization of the SBT film is much larger than the charge required to control the channel conduc-tivity as we pointed out previously.15)The maximum induced charge per unit area by SiO2 is 3.5 µC/cm2, if we assume that the maximum electric field (breakdown field) is 10 MV/cm and the charge which corresponds to the 1 × 1012cm−2elec-trons is 0.16 µC/cm2. On the other hand, the remanent po-larization of SBT films is as large as 10 µC/cm2. Hence, if we select the MFIS structures with SBT films, we cannot use the saturated P–E hysteresis loop but we can use only a small part of the polarization of the SBT film. This may degrade the data retention characteristics as we",1457
Ishiwara_Tokumitsu_2001_Jpn._J._Appl._Phys._40_2917.docx,experiment,"ally showed in the previous section.To overcome this difficulty, MFMIS structures should be selected if the SBT film is used. In the MFMIS structure, the area of an MFM ferroelectric capacitor (SF) can be de-signed smaller than that of an MIS diode (SM). Hence, we can equivalently reduce the polarization of the ferroelectric film. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the simulated ID–VG charac-Fig. 5. Calculated (a) ID–VG characteristics of the MFMIS-FETs and (b) P–E loops used in the MFMIS-FETs when ±5 V is applied.teristics of the MFMIS-FETs and the P–E loops used in the MFMIS-FETs when ±5 V is applied, respectively. The SBT thickness is assumed to be 250 nm. The area ratio, SM/SF, is varied from 1 to 100. Again, the operation voltage is assumed to be 5 V. It is found that the memory window of the MFMIS structure is as small as 1 V for SM/SF = 1, whereas the mem-ory window becomes about 2 V for the MFMIS-FETs when the area ratio, SM/SF is larger than 5. Since the SBT thick-ness is 250 nm and the coercive field is 40 kV/cm, the maxi-mum memory window is 2 V, which agrees with the calcula-tion. It is interesting to note that the used P–E loops in the MFMIS-FETs are almost saturated when the area ratio SM/SF is larger than 5. This is consistent with the fact that the mem-ory window is almost constant (2 V) for the MFMIS-FETs with SM/SF > 5. In the MFMIS-FETs with the area ratio SM/SF of 15, the electric field applied to the SBT layer is as large as 120 kV/cm, which means that completely saturated P–E hysteresis loops can be used in the MFMIS structure if the area ratio SM/SF is 15.According to the above simulations, we fabricated MFMIS-FETs using ferroelectric SBT film and STA/SiON buffer layer, varying the area ratio SM/SF. The thickness of the SBT film is adjusted from 200–250 nm so that the satu-rated P–E hysteresis loop can be used with practical SM/SFJpn. J. Appl. Phys. Vol. 40 (2001) Pt. 1, No. 4BE.

Furthermore, to prevent the high operation voltage and reduce the depolar-ization field during the data retention, (iii) the capacitance of the “I” layer should be large enough and (iv) the thickness of the ferroelectric layer should be carefully designed. In addi-tion, (v) it is important that the leakage currents of both ferro-electric and “I” layers are small to improve the data retention characteristics.To satisfy these conditions, we fabricated p-channel MFMIS-FETs using ferroelectric SBT and STA/SiON insu-lating (“I”) layers. First, field oxide regions were formed in n-(100) Si substrates for device isolation. Then, source and drain regions were formed by BF+ 2ion implantation followed by the activation annealing at 1000◦C for 30 min. Next, after the STA/SiON stacked “I” layer was formed, a Pt floating gate (60 nm) was vacuum-evaporated and pattered by the lift-off process. Then, ferroelectric SBT films were grown by the sol-gel technique on Pt/STA/SiON/Si structures. The thick-ness of the SBT layer used in this work was approximately 250 nm, which is thinner than that (400 nm) in our previous work.8,15)The crystallization of SBT films was carried out by the face-to-face annealing technique at 750◦C.14)Next, Pt gate electrodes were vacuum-evaporated and patterned. Fi-nally, contact holes for source and drain regions were opened by reactive ion etching (RIE) and Al electrodes were formed. The schematic cross section of the fabricated MFMIS-FETs is shown in Fig. 6. Note that in the fabricated MFMIS-FETs, the area of the Pt floating gate is larger than that of the top electrodes. The area ratio SM/SF was varied from 3 to 15. The channel length and width were 5 µm and 50 µm, respec-tively.Figure 7 shows",521

This indicates that the saturated P–E hysteresisFig. 6. Schematic cross section of the fabricated MFMIS-FET.loop of the SBT film is available even when the gate volt-age is as low as ±3.5 V, if the area ratio SM/SF is as large as 12. This is in contrast to our previous work, where about 8 V is necessary to reach the saturation of the memory window. In our previous work, 400 nm SBT films were used in the MFMIS-FETs with an area ratio SM/SF = 6. Therefore, the reduction of the SBT thickness and large SM/SF ratios in this work result in the low voltage operation of the MFMIS-FETs. Figure 8 shows how the ID–VG characteristics of the MFMIS-FETs change with the area ratio SM/SF. The gate voltage sweep is ±3.5 V and the area ratio SM/SF is varied from 3 to 15. It is found that the memory window is only 0.5 V for the device with SM/SF = 3, which indicates that only one of the minor P–E loops is used. On the other hand, when the area ratio SM/SF is larger than 9, the memory win-dow is almost constant and as large as 1.5 V, which shows the saturated P–E hysteresis loop is effectively used in the devices with such area ratios. Hence, by increasing the area ratio SM/SF and reducing the SBT thickness to 250 nm, the MFMIS-FET operating at less than 3.5 V is successfully fab-Fig. 7.

The gate leakage current is less than 3 × 10−8A/cm2 at a gate voltage of ±3.5 V. Next, we examine the data retention characteristics of the fabricated MFMIS-FETs when the small voltage is used to write the data. Figure 9 shows on and off drain currents of MFMIS-FETs with area ratios SM/SF of 6 and 15 as a func-tion of the data retention time. To measure data retention characteristics, we first applied a ±3.5 V programing pulse to write “1” or “0” for 100 ms, then the gate voltage was maintained at −0.35 V during a certain retention time, and the drain current was kept measuring at a drain voltage of−0.1 V. Hence, the depolarization field is constantly applied to the SBT film during the data retention measurements. It is found that the data retention characteristics can be improved by increasing the area ratio. For the MFMIS-FET with an area ratio SM/SF of 6, the drain current on/off ratio is initially 3 × 104and is reduced to less than 103after 6000 s (1.7 h). On the other hand, when the area ratio is increased to 15, the drain current on/off ratio is still about 3 orders of magnitude after 10 h have passed, even if the programming pulse is as low as ±3.5 V. The electric fields applied to the SBT films when the ±3.5 V programming pulse is applied are estimated to be +95 ∼ −70 and +60 ∼ −50 kV/cm for the MFMIS structures with area ratios SM/SF of 15 and 6, respectively. Hence, by using a large area ratio, a relatively large electric field can be applied to the SBT film in spite of the small oper-ation voltage of ±3.5 V, which may result in fairly good data retention characteristics as shown in Fig. 9.5.",1116

It is shown by the numerical simulation that it is impossible to use the saturated hysteresisloop of the SBT film in MFIS structures.

We have demonstrated that fabricated p-channel MFMIS-FETs can operate at a voltage less than 3.5 V. The memory window of 1.5 V was obtained for the device with an area ratio SM/SF = 15, even if the gate voltage sweep is as small as ±3.5 V.

This has been a critical problem for downscaling of conventional ferroelectrics.37 In contrast, ferroelectric properties with remanent polarizations (Pr) larger than 15 µC/cm2 are confirmed for doped HfO2 films that are 10 nm-thick or even thinner. This has enabled the fabrication of the first 28 nm ferroelectric gate field-effect transistors (FeFET).9,24,29,30 According to the extrapolated retention test, the two memory states are expected to remain for 10 years, and these FeFETs are believed to be superior to those prepared with conventional ferroelectrics based on the perovskite structure.9,24,29,30,38 Theoretical work from Ma et al. suggests that the ferroelectric doped HfO2 films have longer retention because of their relatively low relative permittivity er and their high coercive field compared to those of conventional ferroelectrics.39J.

Starschich et al. comprehensively examined the effect of dopant species on ferroelectric properties of their chemical solution deposited (CSD) HfO2 films,11 but there are critical differences between CSD and ALD HfO2 films. From Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns of CSD HfO2 films, the dominant crystalline phase is believed to be cubic phase, and their Pr values before wake-up field cycling were quite small.11 After wake-up field cycling, however, the CSD HfO2 films could show Pr values as large as those of ALD HfO2 films. Therefore, it is believed that the phase evolution during wake-up field cycling is more critical for CSD HfO2 films than ALD HfO2 films. Therefore, the ALD HfO2 films are considered to be more appropriate for structural analysis, since they might have more ferroelectric phase before wake-up field cycling than CSD films. The most serious hindrance for structural analysis may be the structural similarity between the orthorhombic and tetragonal/cubic phase, which are believed to be the origin of ferroelectric and field-induced ferroelectric properties, respectively.15,24,25 Thus far, the identification of a non-centrosymmetric phase (required to enable ferroelectricity) in doped HfO2 thin films has been successfully conducted only by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) based methods,24,40,41 rather than by structural analysis such as XRD.42,43 The symmetries of the zone axes are quite distinct for the Hf positions between the orthorhombic phase and the tetragonal/cubic phase using STEM, but broadening of the diffraction peaks due to the small thickness of the sample makes diffraction (both Bragg-Brentano and grazing incidence) non-ideal for clearly distinguished these phases.

The TiN bottom electrode was deposited via reactive magnetron sputtering at room temperature using a Ti target within an N2 atmosphere for Si- and Al-doped HfO2 films, and via plasma enhanced ALD for Gd-doped HfO2 films. For the deposition of Si-doped HfO2films, tetrakis(ethylmethylamino)hafnium (TEMAHf) and N, N, N',N'-Tetraethyl Silanediamine (SAM.24) were used as precursors, and H2O and O2 plasma were used as oxygen sources, respectively. The Si dopant concentration within films could be controlled by changing the HfO2:SiO2 ALD cycle ratio. For the deposition of Al-doped HfO2 films, hafnium tetrachloride (HfCl4) and trimethyl aluminium (TMA) were used as precursors, respectively, and H2O was used as an oxidant both for Hf and Al. The deposition temperature was 300 °C. For the deposition of Gd-doped HfO2 films, hafnium tetrachloride (HfCl4) and Gd(iPrCp)3 were used as precursors, and H2O was used as an oxidant both for Hf and Gd. After deposition of the doped HfO2 films, a top TiN capping layer was deposited via reactive magnetron sputtering using a Ti target within an N2 atmosphere, and the post-metallization-annealing (PMA) process was conducted at 800 °C for 20 s in N2 atmosphere for the crystallization of the films. After the PMA process, Pt electrodes were deposited via e-beam evaporation, and the Pt electrodes were patterned using a shadow mask. Patterned Pt top electrodes were used as a hard mask during the subsequent TiN wet etch process using a SC1 solution containing NH4OH, H2O2, and H2O. Physical and Chemical Analyses The X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and GIXRD were carried out using a X-ray diffractometer (D8 Discover, Bruker). For GIXRD, the incidence angle was fixed at 0.45°, and the diffraction patterns were analyzed within a 2q range of 15 - 90°. For the quantitative structural analysis, a commercial software for Rietveld refinement (TOPAS, Bruker) was used. For the Rietveld refinement, fundamental crystal structures of monoclinic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic HfO2 and cubic TiN taken from Crystallographic Information File (CIF)47 were used as input. The crystallographic information was taken from Powder Diffraction File (PDF) card numbers 00-034-010448, 04-005-559749, and 04-011-882050 for monoclinic, orthorhombic, and tetragonal phase HfO2, while the PDF number for cubic TiN was 00-038-142051. The details of PDF used for the phases of HfO2 and TiN can be found in the thesis by Schenk.41 For the background fitting, a 5th order Chebychev polynomial combined with 1/x function was used. To consider preferred orientation, the March-Dollase model52,53 was used. The preferred orientation of (111) and (101) were considered for orthorhombic and tetragonal HfO2, respectively. Scale factors for all phases were also controlled during the fitting process. The role of scale factors is to scale the calculated intensities of diffraction patterns, so they should be strongly related with various external factors including X-ray beam intensity and measurement time.

Reproduced with permission. 26 Copyright 2015, AIP Publishing LLC.Figure 1 summarizes the phase dependence upon various driving factors (doping, surface energy, stress…) reported in HfO2 thin films. Referring to the figure, a phase change from the monoclinic (space group P21/c, No. 14), to the orthorhombic, and tetragonal (space group P42/nmc, No. 137) phase is visible for increasing dopant content. The stable phase of bulk HfO2 is the monoclinic phase which is centrosymmetric and thus incapable of supporting ferroelectricity. Another important metastable phase in bulk or thin film HfO2 is the tetragonal phase, and it is well-known that this metastable phase can be stabilized for various dopants or due to surface/interfacial energy effects.24,26,56,57 In 2011, the unexpected ferroelectricity was first reported at the morphotrophic phase boundary of the two phases.1 Various factors affecting the formation of the orthorhombic phase have been reported. Materlik et al. reported that the large free energy difference between the stable monoclinic phase and orthorhombic phase within bulk form can be compensated by the difference between the surface or interfacial energy of the two phases in a polycrystalline thin film structure.26 In addition to size effects, various factors such as dopant concentration, the stress/strain in thin films, electrode materials, and the upper capping layer are reported to affect the polymorphism in doped HfO2 films.24However, the structural changes induced by the aforementioned factors are not clearly understood yet. To date, perovskite-structure-based ferroelectrics have been the most intensively studied among the various ferroelectric materials, and the structural origin of the spontaneous polarization in perovskite materials is well understood based on the distortion of the oxygen octahedra.56 The upper row of figure 2 compares the distortion of the oxygen octahedron in cubic and tetragonal perovskite structures. Generally, ABO3-type perovskites consist of two different cations (A and B) and oxygen ions (O). There are six oxygen ions (each oxygen ion is shared by two adjacent unit cells) in a unit cell, and they are located at the six face centers, while the B-site cation is located at the body center of the unit cell. In the cubic phase, the charge centroids of the cations and anions in a unit cell are equivalent due to the existence of inversion symmetry, meaning that the phase cannot be ferroelectric.

In perovskite ferroelectrics, the tetragonality or c/a ratio is frequently used to simply describe the structural distortion.57-59 The polar axis (c-axis) of the tetragonal perovskite phase is generally larger by a few percent compared to the nonpolar axis (a-axis), so the tetragonality should be strongly related to the distortion of oxygen octahedron. The structural evolution in a fluorite ferroelectric might be also qualitatively similar to perovskite ferroelectrics. The crystal structure of the monoclinic phase is clearly different Fig. 2 A schematic for the structural origin of the ferroelectricity in perovskite and fluorite ferroelectrics.along the c-axis, however, the oxygen octahedron is distorted resulting in a formation of the tetragonal phase. Therefore, the stable location of the B-site cation is displaced away from the center, and there are now two stable eccentric positions. This is the origin of the two stable spontaneous polarization states in a tetragonal perovskite material. An analogous",294

There are four metal and eight oxygen ions in a unit cell of the fluorite structure. Metal ions are located at eight corners and six face centers, while oxygen ions are located at the eight tetrahedral sites. One tetrahedron can be constructed with one corner and three face centered metal ions. For the cubic phase, the oxygen hexahedron with body centered metal ion can be found in two adjacent unit cells. When there is an elongation along the a-axis of the cubic phase, the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase can be formed. In this case, the location of four oxygen ions (whose coordination number is three, yellow oxygen ions in figure 1) is significantly shifted (~13.8 % of c lattice parameter26) from the stable position in a cubic phase, and each of them has two stable positions. There are also slight shifts in the position of the other four oxygen ions (red oxygen ions in figure 1 with four-fold from the tetragonal or orthorhombic phase. However, distinguishing the orthorhombic from the tetragonal phase is very challenging especially given the fact that the Cu-Kα radiation used in standard lab equipment is hardly sensitive to the oxygen in the presence of heavy atoms like Hf. It is reported that there is a large difference between the relative ratio of the longer axis to shorter axes of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phase.15,24 Table I summarizes the lattice parameters of both phases as reported in literature15 , without considering lattice parameters obtained from polycrystalline thin films, since the values might be a lattice parameters average of mixed phases. In summary, two important points should be noticed. First, the aspect ratio (ra, specified as 2a/(b+c) for the orthorhombic and c/a for the tetragonal phase) of the orthorhombic phase is much larger than for the tetragonal phase. The 2a/(b+c) of the orthorhombic phase was in the range of 1.035-1.040,15 while the c/a value of the tetragonal phase was in the range of 1.011-1.027.15 This difference in ra was first pointed out by Park et al. in 2013, and more recent",538

However, it is also noticed that the 2q value of the o111/t101 peak for Gd-doped HfO2 films is generally lower than that of Si- and Al-doped HfO2 films, meaning that the size of the dopant does also affect the d111 and the unit cell volume. On the other hand, it should be mentioned that the strain from (local) epitaxial relation between TiN bottom electrode and doped HfO2 thin films could be neglected. The interface formed between TiN and doped HfO2 thin films is believed to be disordered rather than epitaxial. The lattice parameter of cubic TiN is about 0.424 nm51, while those of orthorhombic HfO2 is in the range of 0.509 – 0.535 nm49. Therefore, their differences are in the range of 20 – 26 %, which are believed to be too large to expect an epitaxial relation between them. Schenk examined the texture of 30 nm-thick Si-doped HfO2 thin film and TiN electrode in his dissertation, and reported that the strongest texture is only three multiples of random distribution for both Si-doped HfO2 and TiN.44 There might be an orientation relationship, but this relationship is not believed to be of a prototypical epitaxial type that gives rise to a certain strain in a specific crystallographic direction that can be easily argued to promote or inhibit the polar character of the polymorphs of doped HfO2 thin films as in epitaxial films. Therefore, the epitaxial stress effect from TiN electrodes is not considered in this work. From the locations of the o111 and o002 peaks, d111 and d002 can be calculated. In addition, the lattice parameters of the longest axis (a-axis for orthorhombic and c-axis for tetragonal phase) and shorter axes (b- and c-axis for orthorhombic and a-axis for tetragonal phase) could be determined using the following assumptions: First, the diffraction peak at 35.4 – 35.9 degrees is caused by a diffraction of o020/o002/t110 planes without contribution from the o200/t002 planes.

However, it should be noted that the lattice parameters taken from GIXRD patterns are averages of lattice parameters of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, whereas the lattice parameters of specific crystalline phase in nanoscale grains can be measured using STEM.25 As expected from figure 4b, the shorter axis of Gd:HfO2 films are generally larger than those of Si- and Al-doped HfO2 films, and the length of the shorter axis is generally found to increase with dopant size. With variations in ALD cycle ratio, the changes in the two shorter lattice parameters are negligible for all the dopants. The changes in the longest lattice parameters are much stronger than that of the two shorter axes lattice parameters. With increasing ALD cycle ratio, the longest lattice parameter decreases for all dopants. From these lattice parameters, ra is calculated and plotted versus the dopant content (figure 4d).

Above these ALD cycle ratios, the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase is the most prominent phase in doped HfO2 films.. The changes in the relative phase fraction of the orthorhombic phase and pristine Pr values with variation in ALD cycle ratio will be discussed in figure 7 and the corresponding text in greater detail..

When an Si4+ ion replaces one Hf4+ ion, the Si-O bond length can decrease to 1.69Å, which is very similar with the ideal Si-O bond length (1.63 Å) in a quartz SiO2 structure.96 Moreover, the O-Si-O angle This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx Please do not adjust margins Journal Name Please do not adjust margins ARTICLE Fig. 8Unit cell volume as a function of ionic radius of dopants.

For the case of Si and Al, the ionic radii for eight fold coordination were calculated from extrapolation.values (105.4° or 117.9°) are also very similar to that in the quartz lattice (108.9° – 110.5°).96 As a result, the relative free energy of the tetragonal phase can decrease significantly compared to the monoclinic or cubic phases.96 As seen in table III, the bond lengths of the orthorhombic phase are very different from the tetragonal phase, and the coordination numbers of oxygen ions are also different: all fourfold in tetragonal and half fourfold and half threefold in the orthorhombic phase.26 In fact, the coordination number of oxygen ions in the orthorhombic is similar compared to those in the monoclinic phase. Although the lattice parameters of the orthorhombic phase are very similar to those of the tetragonal phase, the coordination numbers of Hf4+ and O2- ions in the orthorhombic phase are similar to those in the monoclinic phase. In the orthorhombic phase, the metal-oxygen bond lengths of threefold oxygen ions are 2.24, 2.72, and 2.72Å, while the metal-oxygen bond lengths of fourfold oxygen ions are 2.23, 2.24, 2.32, and 2.33Å. Different from the tetragonal phase, the smallest bond length is 2.23Å with no short metal-oxygen bonds. The shortest bond length is even larger than for the cubic phase (~2.18Å), and it might not be decreased more significantly than for Si:HfO2 in the tetragonal phase. Therefore, the ALD cycle ratio region for ferroelectric properties in Si doped HfO2 films might be quite narrow. A similar effect is expected for Al-doped HfO2, with an ideal Al-O bond length in corundum Al2O3 (1.92Å) being about 14 % smaller compared to the Hf-O bond length in cubic HfO2. Therefore, the ALD cycle ratio range for ferroelectric properties with Al doping might be larger than for Si doping. For the case of Gd3+, the ideal Gd-O bond length should be even larger than for Al-O due to the larger ionic radius of Gd3+ (105 pm) in relation to Al3+ (69 pm) and Si4+ (54 pm).97,98 The ionic radii were taken from a previous study by Shannon for eight fold coordination condition.97 For the cases of Al and Si, there was no ionic radius data within eight This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xxfold coordination, so the values were estimated by extrapolating the ionic radii in four to six fold coordination.98 As a result, the orthorhombic phase can be formed within an even larger ALD cycle ratio range compared to Al-doped HfO2 films. Other possible causes for a dopant dependence of ALD cycle ratio range for strong ferroelectric properties were also examined. The difference in the spatial distribution of dopants might be another possible reason. From TOF-SIMS",897

Park_CSHWang_JMC_2017.docx,results,"were observed possibly attributed to a different electrode. In those papers, a Si or Mo electrode was applied while a TiN electrode was used in our study.99,100 The TiN electrode is expected to partially scavenge oxygen atoms from the HfO2 in interfacial regions introducing a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, which might affect diffusion of Al dopants. It is well known that the TiN top electrode can reduce the interfacial SiO2 layer between HfO2 and the Si substrate.101 Moreover, partial oxidation of the TiN bottom electrode was reported for TiN/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/TiN capacitor structures.102 Overall, the Si diffusion seems much weaker in HfO2 thin films compared to the Al and Gd diffusion. Differences in the diffusivity of Si4+ and Al3+/Gd3+ might be attributed to a different valence number of the dopants and resulting different oxygen vacancy concentration.103 Si4+ is a tetravalent ion, while Al3+ and Gd3+ are trivalent. Therefore, one oxygen vacancy might be included into the HfO2 lattice for every two Al3+ or Gd3+ dopant ions, and the oxygen vacancies might facilitate the diffusion of dopants by lowering the kinetic barrier.103 Due to the relatively low diffusivity of Si, some heavily doped regions might be formed in Si-doped HfO2, and they might be detrimental for the formation of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase. However, further studies are needed to examine the effect of diffusivity. Varying oxygen vacancy levels for trivalent dopants are also considered as one potential cause for the effect of dopants on the ALD cycle ratio range for ferroelectric phase formation. However, the narrowest ALD cycle ratio range in Si-doped HfO2 cannot be understood by the direct effect of oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies are reported to further stabilize the tetragonal phase compared to the orthorhombic phase.61 Therefore, the additional oxygen vacancy doping with Al and Gd doping is expected to decrease the ALD cycle ratio range for ferroelectric orthorhombic phase, which is the opposite from what is",473

Park_CSHWang_JMC_2017.docx,conclusion,", the structural changes within HfO2 thin films doped with Si, Al, and Gd were systematically examined. To quantitatively investigate changes in the GIXRD patterns, Rietveld refinement was first conducted. Here, a strong linear relationship between the orthorhombic phase fraction and the pristine remanent polarization value is confirming the original hypothesis, demonstrating that the underlying ferroelectric response is strongly coupled to the orthorhombic phase fraction of the fluorite crystal structure. The methodology used in this study provides a framework for the newly reported nanoscale fluorite ferroelectrics. Although the HfO2 thin films doped with Si, Al, and Gd were studied here, this structural analysis is believed to be widely applicable even to the fluorite ferroelectrics with different matrix and dopant materials. The largest Pr and orthorhombic phase fraction can be observed within the cycle ratio range of 3 – 4.2 CR%, which is believed to be the doping concentration range of 1 – 3 cat% for all the three dopants. The ALD cycle ratio region for ferroelectric properties was the narrowest for Si-doped HfO2, and increased with increasing dopant size. This can be qualitatively understood based on a metal-oxygen bond length model. The shorter Hf-O bond length in the tetragonal phase is much smaller than in the orthorhombic phase. Therefore, Si doping might decrease the relative free energy of tetragonal phase more significantly compared to the orthorhombic phase. This effect may become weaker with increasing dopant size.",336
Muller_HfZrO2_NL_2012.docx,ABSTRACT,": The transition metal oxides ZrO2 and HfO2 as well as theirsuccessfully introduced into microelectronics, were never considered to be more than simple dielectrics possessing limited functionality. Here we report the discovery of a field-driven ferroelectric phase transition in pure, sub 10 nm ZrO2 thin films and a composition- and temperature-dependent transition to a stable ferroelectric phase in the HfO2−ZrO2 mixed oxide.solid solution are widely researched and, like most binary oxides, are expected to exhibit centrosymmetric crystal structure and therewith linear dielectric characteristics. For this reason, those oxides, even thoughThese unusual findings are attributed to a size-driven tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition that in thin films, similar to the anticipated tetragonal to monoclinic transition, is lowered to room temperature. A structural investigation revealed the orthorhombic phase to be of space group Pbc21, whose noncentrosymmetric nature is deemed responsible for the spontaneous polarization in this novel, nanoscale ferroelectrics.",243
Muller_HfZrO2_NL_2012.docx,introduction,"strongly rely on the challenging integration of perovskite-based materials, these fully CMOS compatible and highly scalable HfO2-based ferroelectrics have the potential to offer a novel and much simpler approach.30,31 Here we report the discovery of a composition- and temperature-dependent ferroelectric phase transition covering the full mixing range of HfO2−ZrO2 thin films. A stable ferroelectric phase is observed for the solid solution at room temperature, whereas a field driven transition is observed in pure ZrO2. A structural investigation by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) suggests a composition-dependent tetragonal to orthorhombic to monoclinic phase change in HfO2−ZrO2 thin films when starting from Zr-rich composi-tions. As further revealed by in situ high temperature GI-XRD, confinement of the thin films by a TiN electrode assists in the suppression of the tetragonal to monoclinic transition during cooling, resulting in an alternative tetragonal to orthorhombic pathway. This noncentrosymmetric, orthorhombic, and thereby potentially ferroelectric Pbc21 phase of the mixed oxide was found to further stabilize with decreasing temperature. This led to a stable ferroelectric phase at 80 K in Zr-rich samples that exhibited only field-driven ferroelectric transition at roomtemperature. Those nonlinear and temperature-dependent dielectric characteristics found in pure ZrO2 and in its solid solution with HfO2 confirm the existence of a tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition and further underline the assumption that the occurrence of ferroelectricity in HfO2 and ZrO2 based thin films is an intrinsic property of those material systems and cannot be explained by doping related defect dipoles or ionic mobility.We utilized atomic layer deposition (ALD) to prepare a set of 9 nm HfO2−ZrO2 thin films on TiN, spanning a wide composition range of the solid solution starting and ending with the pure oxides (Figure 1A). All films crystallized during deposition of a TiN top electrode at 500 °C. The polycrystal-line nature was confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM; Figure 1B). Polarization−voltage (PV) as well as small signal capacitance−voltage (CV) characteristics of TiN-based metal−insulator−metal (MIM) capacitors of those films are depicted in Figure 2A.Just as expected from the centrosymmetry of its monoclinic structure, the pure HfO2 film shows a linear relation between the displacement current and the applied electric field as well as a fairly constant capacitance in this field range. However, as ZrO2 content increases, characteristic ferroelectric PV and CV hysteresis evolve until for a nearly equal mixture of ZrO2 and HfO2 a remanent polarization of 17 μC/cm2is reached. The coercive field of this sample was approximately 1 MV/cm. Further increasing the ZrO2-content in the solid solution leads to a thinning of the hysteresis loop at zero bias, phenomenologically best described as superimposed antiferro-electric-like characteristics. This thinning continues until for pure ZrO2 the remanent polarization has completely vanished and only a distinct double-loop hysteresis remains. When taking a direct look at the current flowing on and off the capacitor during a triangular voltage excitation, as depicted in Figure 2B, the polarization switching can clearly be separated from leakage current contributions that often lead to a confusion of simple paraelectric materials with ferroelectrics.32 A summary of the composition-dependent phase transition witnessed in Figure 2A and B is given in Figure 2C. The remanent polarization, the dielectric constant, and the monoclinic phase fraction estimated from the peak area relation4319 dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl302049k | Nano Lett. 2012, 12, 4318−4323Nano LettersLetterFigure 2.

(C) Remanent polarization, dielectric constant, and monoclinic phase fraction in the HfO2−ZrO2 solid solution with respect to the mixing ratio of the oxides.

Muller_HfZrO2_NL_2012.docx,results,".23In this work the absence of diffractions from the TiN electrode (see sample preparation in Supporting Information) and the high signal-to-noise ratio allow for the identification of the tetragonal phase by the 012t reflection at 42° originating from the slightly distorted oxygen lattice in the tetragonal modification.Unexpected diffractions on the other hand appear for the equal mixture of ZrO2 and HfO2 that was found to exhibit the highest remanent polarization at room temperature. Several reflections are indicated that cannot be explained by a simple phase mixture of P21/c and P42/nmc, suggesting the presence of a third phase stable during the transition from m-HfO2 to t-ZrO2. Similar to in the doped HfO2 systems that were found to exhibit ferroelectricity, this phase best matches the diffraction pattern of an orthorhombic phase with Pbc21 symmetry.24,28,27 The existence of this noncentrosymmetric phase in ZrO2, unfortunately published without data on its dielectric proper-ties, was first and solely reported by Kisi et al.37in 1989. In a neutron diffraction study they observed the Pbc21 phase in small particles of Mg stabilized ZrO2 confined in a cubic matrix. A martensitic tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition induced by a displacement of the Zr and O1 ions against the O2 ion was suggested. This tetragonal to orthorhombic transformation eventually circumvents the volume expanding tetragonal to monoclinic transformation not favorable in a highly constrained environment, such as in a cubic matrix or in our case of a thin film additionally confined by a metal electrode.The supporting nature of the mechanical confinement provided by the TiN electrode in this process can be demonstrated by in situ GI-XRD measurements recorded during cooling. As shown in Figure 3B, a thin film crystallized into the orthorhombic phase is stable toward any further heat treatment above 800 °C as long as the TiN electrode is still in place. However, if this mechanical encapsulation is removed, a transformation to the monoclinic phase can be observed, strongly increasing when temperature drops below 200 °C. These findings are in accordance to the assumption of a reversible, temperature-dependent tetragonal to orthorhombic transition. In the constrained system the orthorhombic phase transforms to the tetragonal phase during heat up and back into the orthorhombic phase during cooling. If the encapsulation is removed, the orthorhombic phase is still stable at room temperature, as depicted in Figure 2A, but after renewed heating into the tetragonal phase part of the system undergoes the well-established tetragonal to monoclinic transformation. As already mentioned, compared to this well-established transition very little research has been conducted on the less common polymorphs of HfO2 and ZrO2. Nevertheless, for pure HfO2 and ZrO2 the stability of the Pbc21 phase was calculated from ab initio by Lowther et al.,39indicating that the relative stability of this phase with respect to the monoclinic phase lies within a narrow range of only ∼10 meV/atom.

The",213
Muller_HfZrO2_NL_2012.docx,results,"are given in the Supporting Information. Due to high leakage contributions at elevated temperatures as well as the technical setup, measurements were limited to 400 K. Within this temperature range no paraelectric behavior in PV measurements and therewith no characteristic permittivity signatures indicating the Curie temperature were observed. Nevertheless, the characterization of the Curie temperature as well as its frequency dispersion would be of great value for a deeper understanding on the nature of the underlying phase transitions.Ferroelectricity originating from a rarely witnessed, non-centrosymmetric modification of HfO2 and ZrO2, namely, the orthorhombic Pbc21 phase, seems reasonable and has proven to be highly reproducible independent of the system investigated.Especially the ferroelectric transition in the ZrO2−HfO2 solid solution described in this work underlies this assumption, since due to the equally sized and completely mixable cations no effect on the oxygen vacancy density is expected and therewith on ionic conductivity. Even though we believe that true, structure-related ferroelectricity is also responsible for the nonlinear dielectric characteristics in the trivalent and tetravalent doped HfO2 systems we reported earlier, the contribution of ionic conduction in these undersized and oversized substituted systems might not be negligible.

Nevertheless, our earlier work indicates that the appearance of this field-driven transition is closely linked to the appearance of the tetragonal phase. This antiferroelectric-like behavior was observed in Si-24and Al-doped-27HfO2 thin films as well. Both systems are stabilized into the tetragonal P42nmc structure with sufficient dopant content. The same is true for the pure ZrO2 layers investigated in this work. Only ferroelectric, Y-doped HfO2 26 did not exhibit such a field-driven transition and as proven by",325
